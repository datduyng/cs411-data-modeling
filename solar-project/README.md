## node (vanilla js) + mongo + mysql

A simple **node.js** (vanilla javascript, no typescript) boilerplate with **Mongo db** and **Mysql**.

To prevent the database from becoming a system-wide bottleneck, especially in high volume environments, NoSQL databases perform in a way that relational databases cannot.
Although NoSQL databases have gained popularity for their speed and scalability, there are still situations in which a highly structured SQL database might be preferable.

## Setup
Clone or download this repo and run command in root dir
> **npm install**

Configure **mongo db** and **mysql db** in **.env.dev** file

**Note: Make sure mongoDB and Mysql is running.**

Thats it.

##  Run
To start app in default development mode:
> **npm start**
