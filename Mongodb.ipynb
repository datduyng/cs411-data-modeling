       "  'comments_content': 'During his keynote at SXSW last month, Twitter CEO Evan Wiliams announced an upcoming new platform called @anywhere, which would allow third party sites to integrate Twitter features (he also showed off some of the partners who would be featuring the platform, which you can see in the image at right).  Twitter didn&#8217;t give a launch date for when sites would start integrating the new platform, but it looks like we&#8217;ve just come across the first site to feature @anywhere.  Meet Eggboiling.com.The site, which will almost certainly be pulled down soon after this post is published, is clearly a testing environment for @anywhere, but it&#8217;s currently open to the public.  Update: Twitter has taken the site down. It features the following (all shown in the screenshots below): various variable states; a button to &#8216;Connect With Twitter&#8217;; buttons to follow twitter users @jack, @biz, and @ev; a test hovercard that allows me to see @wendyverse&#8217;s latest tweets and follow counts at a glance, and a test box that lets me tweet.  It isn&#8217;t particularly easy on the eyes, but it works well enough.Hitting &#8220;Connect to Twitter&#8221; pulled in my Twitter profile photo and gave me the option to log out.  Clicking on each of the &#8216;follow&#8217; buttons appropriately changed the status from &#8220;Follow @jack&#8221; to &#8220;Following @jack&#8221; the next time I refreshed the page. (it just showed &#8216;pending&#8217; until I refreshed). And sending a tweet from the tweet box worked properly (it says that my tweet was sent via Egg Boiling).If you&#8217;re fast, you may be able to try it out for yourself.Before logging inOAuth to loginConnected to Twitter (but before image/logout link have loaded)Image/logout link appear after refreshing the pageTesting the hovercardAfter clicking the &#8216;more&#8217; button on the hovercardThanks to Spencer Transier for the tip!CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Later this month Facebook is holding its f8 conference, where it will be launching a slew of new features (we&#8217;ve already broken the news on quite a few of them).  Tonight, the company has written  a blog post announcing what is perhaps the most ambitious and creepy of them all: Facebook is looking to get into the dating game, and it&#8217;s turning to Zynga for help.The gist of the new product?  Dubbed &#8216;Relationships&#8217;, Facebook is going to soon offer a section of the site dedicated to helping users meet potential romantic partners.  To do that, the company has been working with Zynga over the last four months to develop games that &#8220;synthesize romance and foster relationships through social gaming mechanics&#8221;, helping users flirt and get to know each other using Farmville-like games to help break the ice.In the post, Facebook says that it will look at the profiles of your previous boyfriends/girlfriends to determine the personality traits you&#8217;re attracted to most, and that it will also use advanced photographic analysis to figure out your preferred facial structure and body type. In an attempt to quell privacy concerns before they begin, Facebook notes that all of this is done automatically, and that at no point are employees allowed to view these reports on your innermost psyche. How reassuring.The site appears to be broken up into three sections: at the top is a section for &#8216;Flirts&#8217;, which displays the Facebook friends you&#8217;ve been interacting with most.  In a move certain to cause riots, Facebook is now allowing users to keep tabs on how many times each of their friends has visited their profile. Facebook claims that this will make it easier to figure out who is lusting after you, and that &#8220;shadier&#8221; visitors will simply learn not to be so creepy. Below this is a section for games and lessons.  These appear to be the Zynga-designed apps, which cover everything from flirting to lessons on hygiene.Finally, there&#8217;s a &#8216;Recent Dates&#8217; section.  It&#8217;s unclear exactly what this is for, but there&#8217;s a Facebook-branded baseball diamond that apparently prompts users to share &#8220;how far&#8221; they got on their recent dates to their friends&#8217; News Feeds.  Given how much these definitions have shifted over the years, this could get messy.The 6.8 ProjectPerhaps most interesting is the fact that the new Relationships feature belongs to a new (and somewhat sinister sounding) ongoing initiative that Facebook is internally calling The 6.8 Project. The name, which is an allusion to Earth&#8217;s total population of 6.8 billion people, is meant to symbolize Facebook&#8217;s goal of connecting everyone on the planet.  The concern is that that may not be enough.Facebook has grown so quickly over the last few years that the company is worried that its long-term expansion potential over the next decade is limited. At its current growth rate, Facebook will have saturated the market of Internet-using humans in seven years. So â\\x80\\x94 to put things bluntlyÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0they&#8217;re looking to encourage current users to procreate, though they&#8217;ve only said as much with cutesy euphemisms.Facebook wouldn&#8217;t comment on its future plans for the 6.8 Project, but we hear that the company intends to launch a &#8216;Babybook&#8217; directory for children up for adoption, and there are also discussions about lowering Facebook&#8217;s minimum age to five years old.Excerpt from Facebook&#8217;s Blog:&#8220;Over the last six years, Facebook has been embraced by over 400 million people around the world â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0and we&#8217;re still growing. During that time, our engineers have managed to overcome some truly monumental hurdles, empowering friends and families to share their photos, videos, and thoughts with the people they care about.But there&#8217;s still one fundamental human need that we haven&#8217;t yet been able to take care of, and ironically enough it&#8217;s the primary reason people log on to Facebook every day. It goes by many names: Love. Romance. Great White Buffalo.  Call it what you will, it&#8217;s something that all of us are looking for. We hope to help you find it with Facebook Relationships.We look forward to sharing more details about the new feature at this month&#8217;s f8 conference.  With Relationships, we&#8217;re going to take your friendships to the next level.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It&#8217;s the third of our April Fools jokes and while we knew it would be the most subtle, we didn&#8217;t realize that pretty much no one at all would get the message. So I&#8217;ll explain, but just a little. If you compare the post to the article linked from the post (there&#8217;s just one link in the whole post), you&#8217;ll notice that it is identical to the 1996 NYTimes article announcing their website. The only changes we made were to replace &#8220;Web Site&#8221; with &#8220;iPad App&#8221; and &#8220;Word Wide Web&#8221; with &#8220;iPad.&#8221;And the amazing thing is the story still works. With just a couple more tweaks, like updating the executives in the article, this actually could be a launch post for the NYTimes on the iPad. In fact it works so well that the NYTimes didn&#8217;t get the point. One NYTimes writer even happily retweeted the post. So you see, the more things change, the more things stay the same. The World Wide Web didn&#8217;t save the New York Times. And neither will the iPad.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It turns out not to really matter that much because most online video platforms are now drinking the HTML5 Kool-Aid.  But what about other things that Flash does well, like games?  Well, HTML5 might be a more powerful game engine than most peopel think.To show off what is possible with HTML5 in the browser, some of the engineers on the Google Web Toolkit team created an HTML5 port of the classic first-person shooter game Quake II.  Check it out in the video above.  It is based on an open-sourced Java port of Quake called Jake2.  A post on the Google Code blog explains how they did it:We started with the existing Jake2 Java port of the Quake II engine, then used the Google Web Toolkit (along with WebGL, WebSockets, and a lot of refactoring) to cross-compile it into Javascript. You can see the results in the video above &#8212; we were honestly a bit surprised when we saw it pushing over 30 frames per second on our laptops (your mileage may vary)!It works only on &#8220;modern browsers such as Safari and Chrome&#8221; and you can find the code here.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try it out.  If you can get it to work, tell us what you think in comments.  I really hope this isn&#8217;t April Fool&#8217;s joke.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Something struck me about Apple&#8217;s handling of the iPad launch this week. Instead of countless nerds spouting off in early reviews, only a few major tech press folks got early samples. Instead, the iPad showed up in a show the missus and I watch, Modern Family.* That&#8217;s right: instead of an overfed talking-head tech reporter pawing over the iPad on morning TV, the iPad got prime-time coverage in a sitcom. Think about the last computer company to get that kind of screen time. Only Microsoft, in their abysmal product placement in Family Guy comes to mind. But in Modern Family the iPad was a major plot point. While I&#8217;m sure Apple paid a pretty penny for the exposure, I don&#8217;t doubt the folks at ABC would have put the product in for free had Apple asked.But this shows a very important turning point in Apple marketing. The company, in short, sees the iPad as a mass market phenomenon without peer and is treating it as such. And the iPad, in turn, will become the tool that pushes Apple even deeper into the home.The iPhone convinced millions of people that Apple makes nice phones. The iPad, in turn, will convince millions of people that Apple makes nice computers. Whereas the &#8220;halo effect&#8221; that the iPhone was supposed to have on the rest of Apple&#8217;s wares &#8211; laptops and iMacs and the line &#8211; isn&#8217;t quite apparent except in Apple&#8217;s impressive revenues, I suspect the iPad is going to push people over the hump. While you can get away with booting up craggy old Windows on your craggy old Dell while mucking about in iPhone&#8217;s sylvan glades, you&#8217;re less likely to appreciate your old laptop when its sitting alongside a device that looks like a cross between a robotic communion wafer and something out of Star Trek.To describe this metaphorically, (and this is a horrible metaphor) think of the iPhone as a bicycle made by BMW. No one is going to upgrade to a Ford car if you&#8217;re only used to their bikes but if Ford starts to sell, say, something like an inexpensive Smart car or nice motorcycle with a little more power and all that BMW &#8220;magic,&#8221; there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll buy a Z-Series next time they&#8217;re looking at cars.So the reason you&#8217;re not seeing geeks like us with iPads this week is simple &#8211; the iPad isn&#8217;t for geeks like us. While time will tell if this is a correct assessment, I&#8217;m almost betting on it.UPDATE &#8211; I found some things to add. First, Apple has 91% market share in &#8220;premium PCs,&#8221; which is huge. But in lower-end PCs Windows still rules. Now what happens when a sub-$700 Apple ends up in millions of homes. Much more market share and a real halo effect across the market.*It&#8217;s seriously a really good program. Christopher LLoyd (Frasier and Wings) produces it. I thought it would be dumb at first too. Try it.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Early this year, Blippy, the highly controversial startup that lets you share your credit card and online purchases with your friends, ran into some trouble with Amazon.com.  Namely, Amazon told Blippy to stop pulling in user purchase information, and to go back and erase all existing data they&#8217;d already sucked in.  Today, Blippy users have regained the ability to share their Amazon purchases, but this time, Blippy doesn&#8217;t need Amazon&#8217;s permission.The new Amazon integration requires users to grant Blippy access to their Gmail accounts via OAuth (this only works with Gmail, though the site says it plans to support other email services soon). After linking your Gmail to Blippy, the service will automatically scan your account for Amazon receipts, which it will use to display the items you&#8217;ve purchased in your Blippy feed.  When I asked Blippy co-founder Philip Kaplan if they had Amazon&#8217;s approval, he said they didn&#8217;t ask for it, and they weren&#8217;t sure they needed it, either.The addition of Gmail OAuth support could mean big things for Blippy.  Because Blippy now has a relatively secure way to access your Gmail, it can add support for a plethora of online vendors who may not offer an API. Likewise, Blippy could use the same method to do end runs around services that don&#8217;t want Blippy tracking purchases in the first place.To be clear, OAuth is no magic bullet for keeping your data secure â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you&#8217;re essentially giving Blippy the ability to monitor your Email. But users are already handing over their login credentials for plenty of services to Blippy, which is potentially an even worse security issue (with OAuth, they don&#8217;t actually store your password).Thanks to Mark Hendrickson for the tipCrunchBase Information',\n",

FreshPlanet is a stealthy startup looking to make its public debut with the launch of an educational game for children, Red Fish, on the iPad (iTunes link).FreshPlanet is based in New York City and founded by two serial entrepreneur French brothers, Mathieu and Romain Nouzareth.  It recently raised a $1.5 million Series A from Jeff Clavier&#8217;s SofTech VC and a bunch of French angel investors including Jacques Antoine Granjon (founder of Ventes-privees), Xavier Niel (founder of French ISP Free.fr), and Oleg Tscheltzoff (founder of Fotolia) via CapISF.  Mathieu and Romain previously founded online game distribution service Boonty (sold t French company Nexway) and casual gaming site Cafe.com.Red Fish is based on a popular French kid&#8217;s learning Website called Poisson Rouge.  FreshPlanet licensed the game and developed a version specifically for the iPad to start.  There is no iPhone version.  &#8220;The big screen is much more interesting for us,&#8221; says Romain.Red Fish teaches kids between 3 and 7 to count, read, spell, and even compose music all using the iPad&#8217;s engaging touchscreen.  The app is free and comes with 12 different activities, but to unlock the rest (there are 50 total) will cost $9.99.  You can watch a demo of the app in the video below.  It gives you a good sense of how the iPad can become an educational game platform.  Kids love touchscreens (mine are always fooling with my iPhone), and big touchscreens with games designed for them could prove irresistible. FreshPlanet is also testing a music quiz game on Facebook, and plans to design games for both Facebook, the iPad, and the iPhone.    CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As you may have noticed when Twitter introduced its new homepage a few days ago, Twitter has a new feature that allows them to group together popular tweets. They say this is done algorithmically, and have an account to capture them all here. Now they&#8217;re just turned on this feature on for Twitter search, and its API.As you can see in the search.twitter.com page (but not yet on Twitter.com&#8217;s own search), there are three pinned popular tweets at the top of the results (Twitter notes that it could be less than three, but that three is the max right now). Below each of these, you can see the number of times the tweet was retweeted, giving some indication of why it&#8217;s popular.A message today sent from developer advocate Taylor Singletary to the Twitter development and API Google Groups lets everyone know about the change. He also seems to reveal the keys behind the popularity algorithm:With this new project, we want to make real-time search even more valuable by surfacing the best tweets about a particular topic, by considering recency, but also the interactions on a tweet. This means analyzing the author&#8217;s profile, as well as the number times the tweet has been retweeted, favorited, replied, and more. It&#8217;s an evolving algorithm that we&#8217;ll be iterating on &amp; tuning until practically the end of time.Further, this search change is coming to the API too. Singletary says this feature will be opt-in for developers during this current phase. But it sounds like eventually this will be a standard part of the search API (that undoubtedly developers can choose to leave out if they want to). Here&#8217;s how the results will break down for those who do opt-in:mixed &#8211; receive both &#8220;popular tweets&#8221; and most recent tweets for the query. This is the equivalent of the future default behavior.popular &#8211; receive only &#8220;popular tweets&#8221; for the query.recent &#8211; receive only recent results for the query. This is the equivalent of the behavior you&#8217;ve come to expect until presentTo make this new feature work, each tweet now has a new bit of metadata letting the search query know if it&#8217;s &#8220;popular&#8221; or &#8220;recent.&#8221; Singletary also notes that in the future other metadata layers may be added to further augment results.That seems like a pretty interesting way to make Twitter search more useful and less filled with spam.Update: Twitter has now added popular results to Twitter.com as well. Check out the screenshots below â\\x80\\x94 it&#8217;s less obvious than search.twitter.com but the metadata is there.[thanks Alex]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Today, millions of people around the world were introduced to TEXTp, a new video display format created by YouTube that converts the site&#8217;s videos into a flurry of ASCII characters.  The new format, which was implemented as a cost-saving measure, is saving YouTube $1 per second of content watched in bandwidth costs.Of course, TEXTp is just the latest April Fools prank to come from YouTube (past pranks have included Rick Rolling all of its users and flipping the site upside down).  Yesterday, I had a chance to sit down with some of the people behind this year&#8217;s prank.  Along with explaining how they actually got these ASCII-ized videos working, they also detailed YouTube&#8217;s process for figuring out which pranks get shown to the world. Be sure to check out our full list of other April Fools jokes here.So how did YouTube convert all of its videos to streaming lines of text?  The company leveraged a piece of its existing and seemingly unrelated technology: their 3D video player. Engineer Peter Bradshaw, who is behind the site&#8217;s 3D viewer, says that fellow engineer Blake Livingston adapted his work with Adobe&#8217;s  Pixel Bender (which is used to achieve the 3D effect) to convert the videos into ASCII.Billy Biggs, another software engineer at YouTube (who claims pranks are his full time job), also played a key role in the project.  Bradshaw initially hacked the effect together in one evening, but it took around three weeks for the prank team to get that &#8216;last 10%&#8217; done.The pranksters say that the idea had actually been circling at YouTube for over a year, and that there were many other pranks proposed.  In fact, each YouTube employee is invited to submit their idea in the months leading up to April 1.  To choose which one is actually deployed to users, YouTube uses Google&#8217;s Moderator tool.  After voting concludes, a smaller panel made up of engineers, product managers, and PR reps congregates to figure out which ideas are feasible (and won&#8217;t offend anyone).The prank team didn&#8217;t take this too lightly, either: as I left the the conference room yesterday afternoon, the team was still tweaking TEXTp, trying to hone in on the optimal font size and color palette while waging a war against the letter &#8216;M&#8217;, which had the nasty habit of showing up too often.If ASCII art is your thing, you may also be interested in ASCIImeo, an ASCIIized version of Vimeo.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Have you been doing various searches or combing through the pages the full iPad app directory since those apps started going live earlier? Well stop â\\x80\\x94 because Apple has just completely revamped the App Store to be iPad-centric.As you can see in the screenshot above, the front page of the App Store is now dominated by iPad apps. Yes, the iPad apps that 99.99% of the world cannot use yet because no one outside of a select few testers has the actual device. But that isn&#8217;t stopping Apple from promoting the hell out of these apps. And it&#8217;s working â\\x80\\x94 at least for me. I&#8217;ve already bought a ton of them, and I don&#8217;t have an iPad yet.Humorously, Apple is promoting a bunch of apps that it has asked developers to create embargoes for, for the press. Earlier today, Apple moved that embargo time up from Saturday morning (the actual iPad launch) to tomorrow morning, undoubtedly because they knew they&#8217;d be rolling these App Store changes live. Still, Apple is already showing a ton of embargoed apps on its &#8220;New &amp; Noteworthy,&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot,&#8221; and &#8220;Staff Favorites&#8221; areas. As you can see, Apple has added a button to toggle between iPhone and iPad apps for each area (as well as the charts portion).Oh, and all of the featured areas on the main App Store page are currently iPad apps too except for the one App Store on Facebook promotion. This includes the main banner area which is shuffling through iPad apps such as Labyrinth 2, ABC&#8217;s streaming app, OmniGraffle, the WSJ app, and Apple&#8217;s own iWork apps.A few other iPad apps Apple is featuring include the Netflix app (yes, it&#8217;s real), Epicurious, and the Pandora app.CrunchBase Information',\n",

What people disagree about is whether it&#8217;s worth having around, what with Apple&#8217;s chokehold on content and the limited inputs. Hell yeah, it is! But for flicking my way through word documents, watching scaled-down HD content in mono, and designing presentations? Nah.It&#8217;s not until one of the thousands of hackers out there, with teeth sharpened on jailbroken iPhone apps, gets their iPad and cracks the mother wide open, that we&#8217;re going to have the real fun. And I have reason to believe that&#8217;s going to happen mighty fast.Why do you think Apple neglected to include USB slots and an SD card slot? Because obviously they want you to buy the pre-approved games and apps from the App Store. Sure, those will be nice. Tower defense games are going to be fun as hell, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the big Diablo-esque dungeon crawler that&#8217;s surely in development. But brother, I want to play me some arcade games! I want a custom file browser, and support for obscure video formats! I want unfettered access to the device I just paid $500 for!The single input is the big issue, but the dock is essentially a USB-to-iPad cable. Sync everything over that, even &mdash; dare I dream &mdash; driver support for multiple wireless controllers? I&#8217;m thinking how perfect this thing is for couch or travel gaming &mdash; but I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to limit myself to the App Store. Bring on the DOS emulators. Bring on dual-boot with Chrome OS.The limitations are very few. With the iPhone, it still had to function as an iPhone &mdash; adding forbidden functionality on top of that was difficult and broke often. But the iPad is far less tethered to its OS, and I get the feeling that&#8217;s going to result in a bonanza for people willing to hack it.See, here&#8217;s the thing. It&#8217;s not just that the iPad is a great device. You may or may not think it is; personally, I think it&#8217;s incomplete and compromised by Apple&#8217;s control fetish. If I pay $500 for this thing, I&#8217;m not buying an Apple product, I&#8217;m buying a beautiful touchscreen device that has hackers and developers the world over drooling over the possibilities. You may dislike that it&#8217;s the Applest Apple product ever to come out, but you can&#8217;t argue with the numbers being sold and the hardware itself. Decent CPU, discrete GPU, responsive touchscreen, familiar resolution &mdash; it&#8217;s a tablet computer, whether Apple wants to let you use it as one or not. I don&#8217;t know about you guys, but in my world, the consumer decides what the device is for, and the iPad is a great place to prove it.',\n",

Yesterday, the blog AppAdvice had an exclusive story that Netflix was bringing a free app to stream movies to the iPad. Plenty of people thought this was just an early April Fools joke because, quite frankly, it seemed almost too good to be true. But it is very true. The app is now live in the App Store.Assuming you&#8217;re a Netflix member, the new iPad app lets you watch as many movies as you want (assuming they&#8217;re available on Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly service) streaming to the device. Yes, this gives you access to some 20,000+ movies and television shows. You can also browse movies and manage your queue from the app. And you can even pick up watching them from where you left off on your TV or computer.And since the iPad is currently WiFi-only, you don&#8217;t have to worry about streaming over 3G, so performance should be good. It will be interesting to see what happens with this app when the WiFi + 3G models of the iPad hit later this month.And yes, the app is currently iPad-only â\\x80\\x94 there is no iPhone or iPod touch version.

Epicurious, which combines the content of shuttered magazine Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Self and user generated recipes, is a popular recipe database that features over 100,000 recipes, menus, articles, food guides and more. The cooking site&#8217;s companion, free iPad app just launched, and as an avid cook, it looks like a winner.The app, which is similar in features to its sister iPhone app, is essentially a tabbed digital cookbook which allows you to access 27,000 recipes from both Gourmet and Bon Appetit. You can browse recipe collections, search via keyword, and filter your searches by what&#8217;s in your fridge, seasonal foods, holidays and more. You can add any recipe to your favorites box to save it as well as email recipes to yourself and others. You can also add ingredients from your saved recipes to shopping lists and check off items as you buy them. What would be really useful is if your accounts on your iPhone and iPad apps could sync so that you could use your iPhone for your shopping lists on the go, and use your iPad for browsing recipes and to visualize recipes in the kitchen. Another compelling feature would be the ability for other users (i.e. a husband, wife or roommate) to add to the shopping list from a different device. At this point it&#8217;s unclear if you can sync accounts between devices. The nature of the iPad may breathe new life into cooking and recipe apps. While reading recipes on the iPhone and other mobile devices while cooking can be tough; the iPadâ\\x80\\x99s large screen simulates a digital cookbook. And we all know that the iPad will be used as an e-book, allowing users to download and access cookbooks directly from their device in addition to using apps like Epicurious&#8217; offering. According to a recent survey conducted by Epicurious competitor AllRecipes, one out of five people bring their laptops into the kitchen to access recipes. However, the drawback to the iPad entering the kitchen is that it is a dangerous place for a laptop, with significant threats of spills onto keyboards. But the iPad should come with protective screens and stands, making it safer to use in the chaos of the kitchen. AllRecipes is also planning to launch an iPad app in the near future.Epicurious isn&#8217;t the only Conde Nast property with an iPad app to make into the store ahead of time. GQ&#8217;s app hit the App Store today and costs $2.99 to download. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Among the features listed on their site: append-only algorithms, lock-free concurrency, and live schema changes (you can see more technical details here).There&#8217;s obviously risk involved with trying to redefine how people structure their databases (this seems like the sort of thing that will either never gain traction or become very successful), and the company&#8217;s strong roster of investors represents a big vote of confidence.

Based on the App Store description and screenshots, you can expect Pandora to be one of the top apps on the iPad as well.Version 3.0 of Pandora is a Universal app, meaning it includes builds for the iPhone and iPad. Those who have the app installed (likely most of you with an iPhone or iPod touch) probably downloaded the update automatically today through iTunes. So what&#8217;s in it? Well, obviously there is a completely redesigned interface for the iPad (see screenshots below). But Pandora has also added album artwork to the station list across all the platforms. Perhaps most significantly, Pandora has also improved the audio streaming across the board. This means faster start times and fewer dropouts.The iPad version takes advantage of the large 9.7 inch screen of the device. Rather than having to switch views to see things such as your stations, they can reside on the left hand side of the screen as your album artwork and artist information is on the right hand side. Artist information is a particular area of emphasis with this new app. The top player looks similar to iTunes now, with play and pause buttons, as well as thumbs up and thumbs down buttons. There is also an easy-to-access search box along the top.On top of the new iPad app, Pandora CTO Tom Conrad tweeted earlier today that the service has just signed up its 50 millionth user (up from 40 million this past December). Good timing, they&#8217;re potentially about to get a whole lot more from this new device.Find Pandora in the App Store here. It&#8217;s a free download. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Advertisers who already use these tools, can now create and manage their Facebook ads alongside their other types of ads.  All of this is done via the Facebook Ad API.The more that Facebook can get its ad system to work with the existing ad technology out there, the easier it will be for advertisers to start trying out campaigns on Facebook.  Opening up its Ads APIs, though, also puts extra pressure on Facebook to prove that its ads can perform just as well or better than ads elsewhere on the Web.

It seems to be a pretty big deal that will get a tsunami of press coverage without Apple lifting a finger. But just in case, Apple has decided to embargo several iPad apps (and maybe most of them), so they can&#8217;t talk to the press before Apple tells them its okay. The only problem? Apple today unleashed all of their apps in the App Store already. Yes, Apple has broken its own embargo â\\x80\\x94 hundreds of them. Awesome.Initially, Apple had set a Saturday morning embargo for these approved iPad apps to coincide with the iPad availability. But today, Apple apparently moved up the embargo time to early tomorrow morning, we&#8217;re told. But again, they&#8217;re actually already in the App Store now, complete with pictures and descriptions. So anyone who wants to write about any of these apps can just scan the store and write away.Even better, plenty of apps, if they&#8217;re Universal (meaning bundled with both an iPad and iPhone versions), are already auto-updating, so you probably have several iPad apps already even if you don&#8217;t realize it. Naturally, you can&#8217;t use the iPad versions until you have the device, but they&#8217;re right there on your machine.Apple, we hate embargoes too, so we think your undermining them is just great.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The New York Times will begin publishing daily on the iPad, offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper&#8217;s contents.The New York Times on the iPad, as the electronic publication is known, contains most of the news and feature articles from the current day&#8217;s printed newspaper, classified advertising, reporting that does not appear in the newspaper, and interactive features including the newspaper&#8217;s crossword puzzle.The iPad App (address: http:/www.nytimes.com) is part of a strategy to extend the readership of The Times and to create opportunities for the company in the electronic media industry, said Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic Media Company.The company, formed in 1995 to develop products for the rapidly growing field of digital publishing, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The New York Times Company, and also produces the times service on America Online Inc.Mr. Nisenholtz reports to Russell T. Lewis, the president and general manager of The New York Times, and to Joseph Lelyveld, the newspaper&#8217;s executive editor.The iPad-based Times is the newest of dozens of papers available to a global audience on the Internet&#8217;s fastest-growing service, which lets iPad users see electronic publications consisting of text, pictures and, in some cases, video and sound.A selection of the day&#8217;s news, discussion forums and other material from The Times has been available through the @times service since the spring of 1994 on America Online.The iPad&#8217;s global audience means a larger potential readership than that of @times, which is limited to America Online&#8217;s subscribers, currently more than four million. The new site also offers new products and services.&#8220;Our iPad App is designed to take full advantage of the evolving capabilities offered by the Internet,&#8221; said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times. &#8220;We see our role on the iPad as being similar to our traditional print role &#8212; to act as a thoughtful, unbiased filter and to provide our customers with information they need and can trust.&#8221;The iPad will also offer access to much of what the newspaper has published the previous week and access to feature articles from as far back as 1980.Mr. Nisenholtz said that initially, at least, no subscription or access fee would be charged for readers in the United States and that the iPad App would generate revenue from advertising. Readers who connect to the iPad App from outside the country will be offered a 30-day trial without charge, but will eventually face a subscription fee.Advertisers that have already announced participation on the iPad App include Toyota Motor Corporate Services, Chemical Bank and the Northeast real estate concern Douglas Elliman.Subscribers will have limited access to archives of Times articles and features dating to 1980, and will be able to copy articles to their own iPads for $1.95 each, Mr. Nisenholtz said.The new service will also offer, for a fee, a customized clipping service that delivers to a subscriber&#8217;s electronic mailbox articles gleaned from each day&#8217;s editions of the newspaper, based on key words the subscriber selects.With its entry on the iPad, The Times is hoping to become a primary information provider in the computer age and to cut costs for newsprint, delivery and labor. Companies that have established iPad-based information sites include television networks, computer companies, on-line information services, magazines and even individuals creating electronic newspapers of their own.&#8220;The New York Times name will get people to look at the product once or maybe twice, and the fact that The New York Times has the kind of reach and credibility it does may persuade people to look three or four times,&#8221; said John F. Kelsey 3d, president of the Kelsey Group, a consultancy running a conference on iPad Apps next month.&#8220;The market is booming for newspapers on the iPad,&#8221; Mr. Kelsey said.CrunchBase Information',\n",

We&#8217;ve seen dozens of brands sign up with Foursquare to promote things, and they&#8217;re starting to embrace Gowalla in a major way too. The latest three are: Adobe, Chipotle, and the New Jersey Nets.Today at his Where 2.0 talk in San Jose, CA, Gowalla CEO Josh Williams unveiled Adobe&#8217;s plan to use the service&#8217;s signature stamps to give away a dozen copies of their new Creative Suite 5 software. These stamps will be hidden in various places all around America. To find one, you simply check-in to a venue and it will appear on your screen. You can then hit a button to get the details for how to redeem it for a copy of the software.Additionally, Gowalla is teaming up with the big Mexican food chain Chipotle to give users stamps at over 1,000 locations across the U.S. Currently, these stamps are just to pretty-up your profile, but eventually these are undoubtedly part of Gowalla&#8217;s larger plan to be able to trade these in for free items in stores.Finally, the New Jersey Nets are working with Gowalla to give away 500 tickets to their final home game against the Chicago Bulls taking place on April 12. Sure, the Nets may be the worst team in the NBA, but it would still be hard to pass up on a free game.Yesterday, I moderated a panel at Where 2.0 with both Gowalla and Foursquare on it, as well as Loopt, Plancast, and Twitter. All parties indicated brands being so interested in location at this point that they&#8217;re actually the ones approaching the companies about deals, rather than the other way around.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'hi5, an also ran social network that most people forgot about long ago, has raised $3 million convertible note from existing investor Mohr Davidow. We&#8217;ve confirmed the funding, which was raised a year ago, with the company. This brings the social network&#8217;s funding up to $38 million. Hi5, which has been actively remodeling its site to cater to the gaming industry, says this funding is part of a larger Series B round. Another undisclosed investor will be leading the round. The company just bought gaming startup Big Six. Last fall, the social network launched a totally revamped site that places a much stronger emphasis on games and virtual currency, along with a new avatar system. As we&#8217;ve written in the past, with the massive success of Zynga and Playfish, it makes sense that hi5 would try to create a social network that centers around gaming itself. hi5 has over 60 million members, which is a far cry from Facebook&#8217;s 400 million users. In December, hi5 brought on a new president, gaming industry veteran, Alex St. John, to help lead the social network&#8217;s efforts. Earlier in the year, the company suffered from layoffs and also hired a new CEO, Bill Gossman. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Or just wait for it to be delivered to your house.Anyway, this guy is determined to sit in front of the Apple store for two days and nights.

Nobody expects iPhone-long lines for this launch, but for the Mac faithful there&#8217;s always a badge of honor that comes with being first.Update:  Greg appears to be the same guy who was first in line at the same Apple NYC store for the original iPhone when it came out.

       "  'comments_content': 'To say that the enTourage eDGe dualbook is &#8220;just an e-reader with a bolted-on netbook&#8221; (or vice versa) is to pretty dramatically miss the entire point of this thing. The eDGe exists in a category all by itself, because it does an awful lot more than just an e-reader or just a netbook. As a unique product, there are a couple of unfortunate shortcomings, but on the whole the dualbook represents an exciting glimpse at new ways to access and use technology and content. Devin pooh-poohed the eDGe recently, but I&#8217;m pretty excited about it.Short VersionThe enTourage eDGe is a functional, easy-to-use device that currently defies formal classification. It&#8217;s primarily going to be useful to academics and people who spend a lot of time in books, but need more convenience than that offered by separate e-book reader and laptop. It has some warts, but offers surprising value in a first-generation device.FeaturesThe left half of the eDGe is the e-reader.9.7 inch display1200 x 825 pixelsuses e-InkÂ® technologytouch-sensitive, allowing for handwritten notes or sketchesThe right half of the eDGe is an Android-powered touchscreen netbook.10.1 inch display1024 x 600 pixelsincludes an audio recorder to capture lectures for later playback or sharinghas a video camera to record still images or movies as MP4s or 3GP filescan toggle between landscape and portrait orientationThe whole package:two USB ports for connecting peripherals,  one SD card slotone USB port to connect your eDGe to your computer as a removable deviceWiFi and Bluetoothuser-replaceable batteryMSRP $499Prose-ink display makes reading e-books extremely easy on the eyestouchscreen notebook is easy to usegood battery lifepowered by Android!ConsSlow boot timeno access to Android marketplace, currentlyhard-to-use eDGe bookstore, currentlyFull ReviewMy fourteen minute video above shows some of the neat features of this new device.At three-ish pounds, the weight of the unit is not too bad. The construction is fair, but frankly it doesn&#8217;t feel quite as rugged as I would like. The two halves do not lock in any way &#8212; neither mechanical nor magnetic &#8212; so when it&#8217;s &#8220;closed&#8221; it pops open just a little bit. The hinges are not loose, though, so it&#8217;s not like the eDGe flips open in the same way a real book does: you need to actually open it.The GoodThe integration of netbook and e-reader is very well done. Navigating the library on the netbook portion allows you to see your available texts without affecting the currently displayed book. So if you merely want to look up the title of another work in your library without actually leaving your current selection, for example, you can.Battery life is good, especially if you manually lock the touchscreen portion of the unit: this allows you to use the e-reader portion for considerably longer periods.The dual-screen and dual-functionality of the dualbook allow for more than just &#8220;reading e-books + some other task&#8221;, like reading email or taking notes or looking up details on Wikipedia. It allows rich content to be embedded in an e-book that can be accessed on the touchscreen: you can send selections from the e-reader screen to the netbook screen. You can select a portion of the book you&#8217;re reading &#8212; whether a section of text, or an embedded image &#8212; and view it on the netbook screen, with the added ability to zoom in and zoom out. The zoom doesn&#8217;t improve the quality, unfortunately, so since most PDFs and e-books drastically compress their images, zooming in merely displays a big jagged image. Hopefully this situation will improve over time, and higher fidelity images will be embedded in e-books.There&#8217;s an interesting application for this feature, though: being able to review a figure or diagram separate from the page on which it is displayed. In academic contexts, this can be a really useful ability. Whether you&#8217;re studying physics or art, you can keep an image or diagram open on the right while you continue to read the text on the left. No more flipping back and forth between pages to refer back to a figure. In addition to viewing images as described above, video and audio files can also be linked to and accessed from the e-books.Notes can be added to e-books, and those notes can be viewed on the touchscreen in an indexed display. This lets you review annotations you may have made to a work, and jump straight to a specific portion of the e-text. You type up a note on the touchscreen side of the unit, so you don&#8217;t lose sight of what you&#8217;re reading.The e-book screen can toggle between displaying an e-book and becoming a free writing surface. Using the stylus you can handwrite notes, sketch, doodle, do long division, or whatever. Anything you create in this way can be exported to PDF, so you can share your creations with others, or just keep an archive of your work.The BadThe unique form factor of the dualbook takes some getting used to. I found it equally comfortable to use the device in both &#8220;full open&#8221; and &#8220;folded over&#8221; configurations, though it took me awhile to find where to put my hands so that my fingers and thumbs didn&#8217;t accidentally hit the buttons. My understanding is that this is a pretty common complaint against most e-readers.Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the eDGe currently is its use of Android. Android was designed for mobile phones, and the eDGe is not a mobile phone. This has interesting consequences. The first is that the eDGe is prohibited from accessing the Marketplace in the normal fashion. Use the browser on the touchscreen, and try to find an app. Almost all links to apps use the market:// URL. Clicking any of these in the default eDGe browser produces an error that it doesn&#8217;t know how to handle that URL. If you can find a .apk Android package, you can load it manually onto the eDGe and install it, but this is currently a laborious process. According to Doug Atkinson, VP of marketing and business development at enTourage Systems, there are plans to build their own app marketplace, so that third-party Android apps can be easily installed. There is currently no ETA for this.Another side-effect of using Android, and the default browser, is that file uploads are disabled. Again, this is because Android is built for phones, and Android on phones doesn&#8217;t allow file uploads by default. (The same currently holds true for Safari on iPhone, incidentally.) Once enTourage&#8217;s app store opens up this may no longer be an issue, but the lack of file uploads does affect the usability of the eDGe in academic contexts. Many colleges and university have online course management systems through which students upload completed assignments. You won&#8217;t be able to upload anything from the eDGe right now, so it&#8217;s not going to completely replace your desktop or laptop computer.The other big problem with the eDGe is the eDGe bookstore. The interface you see using a desktop browser at www.entourageedge.com is not the interface you see when visiting that site from the eDGe itself. enTourage Systems has designed their book store to work reasonably well with the eDGe&#8217;s small screen and limited navigation controls. The problem is actually finding the content you want. If you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want, you&#8217;ll be required to sort through page after page after page of offerings: there is no way to sort by popularity, or publication date, or price, or author name, or title name. You can browse books by subject, but there&#8217;s no there&#8217;s no way to further refine the listing.  I don&#8217;t know how enTourage is sorting their books, but you&#8217;re forced to live with whatever organization they&#8217;ve chosen to use. Again, Doug Atkinson tells me that this will evolve over time, and that getting the store up was priority number one. Making the store better is priority number two, and hopefully will happen soon.This is my first real experience with an e-reader of any sort, so I&#8217;m probably just now discovering a lot of what other folks have already found. Like how crappy footnotes are, for example. The eDGe has this whole other screen available, but viewing a footnote in an e-book still requires me to move away from my place in the text on the e-reader side, read the footnote, then click back to the page I left. That&#8217;s stupid. I mean really stupid. Even without the use of the second screen, I don&#8217;t see why a footnote requires its own full-page content display. The e-reader screen clearly supports modal dialog boxes: I think footnotes should display in a pop dialog box.Another major problem with electronic content is ownership. You don&#8217;t own the books you buy. You have merely purchased the right to read the work on this device, and maybe on a couple of other devices. This really bothers me, because it strips away the privileges granted to us under the first-sale doctrine. When I finish reading a physical book, I can loan it to a friend to read. Or I can give it outright to them. Not so with e-books and DRM. This really, really bugs me. An interesting consequence of this situation is that the used textbook market will be completely eliminated in the digital realm, allowing textbook published to enjoy full price sales for each of their digital texts.ConclusionI might appear hyper-critical of the eDGe in this review, but that&#8217;s because I really want to see this thing succeed. I am excited by the possibilities that this form factor introduces, and I think the convergence of features in a product like this will provide better long-term functionality than shoe-horning either feature set into a form factor that doesn&#8217;t adequately support it. That is to say, tablets and netbooks don&#8217;t make good e-readers in my mind, and e-readers don&#8217;t make good general purpose Internet devices. Of course, the only constant is change, so it&#8217;s entirely possible that the eDGe will be leapfrogged by some new product within a year. And enTourage is a pretty new player in a very competitive field, so they may not be able to stand up against larger companies, should those larger companies decide to compete. But for now, I think the eDGe offers a very compelling product at a pretty good price.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'According to a new study released by PR Week and PR Newswire, 52% percent of bloggers surveyed consider themselves journalists. This is an increase from 2009â\\x80\\x99s study, when just one in three had the same opinion. However, despite this, only 20% of bloggers obtain the majority of their income from their blogs; which is an 4% increase from 2009. A few other stats caught our attention as well. When it comes to using blogs and social networks, like Twitter or Facebook, for research, 91% of bloggers and 68% of online reporters &#8220;always&#8221; or &#8220;sometimes&#8221; use blogs for research. But only 35% of newspaper and 38% of print magazine journalists surveyed use blogs or social networks for research purposesThe stats are even more interesting when it comes to using Twitter, which is often a place for breaking news and consumer trends, alone for research. 64% of bloggers and 36% of online reporters said they use Twitter as a research tool for stories. But only 19% of newspaper reporters and 17% of print magazine reporters use the microblogging network as a resource for research. Newspaper and print magazine reporters also source Twitter less frequently than their online counterparts with 19% and 22% saying they have used a Twitter post in a story, respectively. This is in contrast the higher use of sourcing Twitter for stories for bloggers (55%), online magazine/news (42%) and even TV news (48%).Here at TechCrunch, we rely on other blogs for research even more than traditional news outlets.  And we use Twitter as a tool not just for breaking news, but also to evaluate the sentiment of consumers about a particular product or service.  For example, my colleague MG Siegler used the breaking news of Tiger Woodsâ\\x80\\x99 car accident to show the inherent value of Twitter when it comes to the speed of reporting news.Photo Credit/Flickr/MikeLichtCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Startup NearVerse, the developers of proximity based mobile social network LoKast, has raised $1 million in seed funding from Meakem Becker Venture Capital.  NearVerse is using funding to further develop LoKast to accelerate its connectivity beyond the capabilities of existing 3G or 4G carrier networks. Launched at SXSW few weeks ago, LoKast, which is actually short for â\\x80\\x9clocal-casting,â\\x80\\x9d allows you to set up a profile that will list all of your photos, selected contacts, videos, web links and music on your mobile phone. You can select which content youâ\\x80\\x99d like to include to the public and which content youâ\\x80\\x99d like to keep private. When a LoKast user is in proximity (300 feet) of other LoKast users, the app will automatically discover other users nearby and allow the user to view and download their content. For example, you can see the iTunes library of any user who is in close proximity to you. You can choose to download a 30-second clip of any song to your own profile and can also follow the link to the iTunes store to purchase the music (LoKast collects an affiliate fee for this, of course). Similarly, you can download photos, videos and even contacts from other users into your profile. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll also soon be able to share apps on your phone with other users.The beauty of Lokast is that it has its own internal network; eliminating the need for 3G connectivity to run the app, as LoKast works in subways, underground and heavily congested areas such as stadiums, where 3G connectivity is unreliable. The startupâ\\x80\\x99s app is effectively all network based and currently has five patents for its proprietary technology.LoKast is also partnering with bands to help market their content to users. LoKast has struck deals with music distribution companies including The Orchard, IODA and Monalis 360 to provide users with exclusive content within the LoKast app. And production companies, such as Mark Cubanâ\\x80\\x99s Magnolia Pictures, are also using the service to promote their new films.And LoKast will soon be launching an Android app, and plans to launch integration with Facebook Connect. The app itself is incredibly simple to use and seems like it has potential to be a great way to share content on your mobile phone. Of course, some people may not feel comfortable sharing their personal content to complete strangers, so that may be a barrier for certain users. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Visiting their London offices recently impressed upon me how few people they actually have in Europe. A few sales staff, a PR, receptionist etc. As far as I could tell, only the affable Christian Hernandez was doing anything in wider Europe, as Facebook&#8217;s international biz dev guy. So it&#8217;s not before time that it&#8217;s expanding its global sales organisation.Joanna Shields has re-emerged after recently exiting from her role at AOL, as Faceboook&#8217;s new VP of Sales and Business Development for EMEA.  Joanna was previously CEO of Bebo and President of People Platforms at AOL.Joanna was also the person who got advertising agencies to buy into Bebo, thus triggering its sale to AOL. We are talking one persuasive person here.Vice President EMEA at Facebook Blake Chandlee, who opened the London sales office, is now shifting over to lead a newly created role as Vice President of Sales for Emerging Markets focusing on Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  This is a smart move by Facebook. Having recently visited Turkey, where Facebook has a third of its global users (yes, really), I&#8217;d say Facebook&#8217;s next wave of growth is going to be in these emerging markets.

Google wants to nuke China? Yep, you can write that. Want to accuse the next attorney general of California of assaulting you? Check. Etc.And Google takes April Fools very seriously.  They launched Gmail on April 1, 2004, which is totally meta. And there are so many good Google jokes from April Fools past: Google Paper, Google TiSP, and Google Romance were all winners. One Google joke even erupted into a minor Wikipedia war over time travel.Google Topeka? Not so funny. They&#8217;ve changed their logo on the Google homepage to Topeka and give this link as an explanation. They&#8217;ve changed their corporate name, they say, to Topeka for the day.The problem is the whole joke is really just a way to promote Google&#8217;s experimental fiber network. 1,100 cities are begging to be part of the program and doing crazy things, like renaming their city name to Google, to get picked.We didnâ\\x80\\x99t reach this decision lightly; after all, we had a fair amount of brand equity tied up in our old name. But the more we surfed around (the former) Topekaâ\\x80\\x99s municipal website, the more kinship we felt with this fine city at the edge of the Great Plains.Anyway, if you&#8217;re promoting your own stuff on April Fools you need to be extra funny. This isn&#8217;t extra funny.And what happened to Google Jail? As far as I can tell it remains unannounced. Maybe they got mad that Fast Company scooped them on their own joke. Or maybe someone at Google decided it was a bad idea to mock the horrific prison situation here in the U.S.We&#8217;re grading this one an &#8220;D-&#8221; on our list of 2010 April Fools jokes.

It begins with footage of television pioneer Philo Farnsworth (an alien-sounding name, indeed), winds through the 20th century, and concludes with Hulu, which finally helped TV&#8217;s brain-melting content expand its reach well beyond the living room.The documentary includes interviews with UCLA Professor Fabian Wagmister and journalist/comedian Dan Lyons (AKA Fake Steve Jobs).

       "  'comments_content': 'For the past several months, I&#8217;ve given WolframAlpha a hard time. I actually think the service is pretty cool, I just think they drastically overpriced their iPhone app. The computational engine was trying to get users to pay $50 for the information they could access for free online. Sure, there&#8217;s something to be said for an iPhone-tailored experience, but $50 was just ridiculous. And guess who now agrees? WolframAlpha.The service has slashed â\\x80\\x94 and I do mean slashed â\\x80\\x94 the price of the app from $49.99 all the way down to $1.99. Yes, they&#8217;ve discounted it $48. That&#8217;s a 96% price reduction. And not just that â\\x80\\x94 they&#8217;re offering a refund to anyone who did pay the ridiculous price for the app. Yes, a full refund â\\x80\\x94 and Apple is keeping their 30%, so WolframAlpha is losing money by doing this.Between the $49.99 version and the $19.99 discounted version that was on sale during the holidays, 10,000 copies of the app were sold, we&#8217;re told. That&#8217;s not awful, but it&#8217;s nowhere near the number WolframAlpha needs to be ubiquitous. And that&#8217;s exactly what WolframAlpha has decided it wants to be.The $1.99 price will certainly help towards that goal, but so will the reinstatement of the mobile-optimized version of the site. You may recall that WolframAlpha took that version away in December, erroneously thinking people would buy the $50 app without it. Now, it&#8217;s back too.More changes to make WolframAlpha appeal to all sorts of people will be coming too, we&#8217;re told.For now, check out the handsomely-priced $1.99 app.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Shame on you, and TL;DR follows.Pogue says it&#8217;s no laptop replacement, but as a giant iPod touch, it&#8217;s a huge success. Mossberg says he enjoys doing most tasks on it much more than on his laptop, and considers it 80% a laptop replacement. Pogue hates the keyboard, Mossberg likes it. Both found the battery life to be exceptional &mdash; over the quoted 10 hours in both cases, which surprises me hugely. We talked about the iPad&#8217;s potential and competitors in today&#8217;s podcast, and the consensus was that, as both reviews stress, the flagship apps are the real indicator of the device class&#8217;s potential.PC Magazine and USA Today also weigh in, and are similarly positive. Among PC Mag&#8217;s cons is the fact that earbuds are not included. Really now. Xeni has one over at BoingBoing, and she likes it so much she shot pictures of it with a soft focus filter &mdash; my mistake, it&#8217;s probably just an iPhone camera.I notice there are few complaints about the lack of Flash support. That&#8217;s something that will emerge in time, I think &mdash; when a hundred thousand people start cruising the net and find that quite a few of their favorite sites have a few bits missing.

It&#8217;s called the CrunchPad Kit and it goes on sale now. Best of all, we&#8217;re selling this for just $49 as an introductory price. Once 800 have sold, or about $44,000 in revenue, we&#8217;ll be moving to a higher price.The CrunchPad team has been working around the clock here at our Palo Alto headquarters to get the kit ready for full production in time for the delivery of the iPad on April 3.We know you want an iPad, but you aren&#8217;t as excited about that $499+ price tag. With the CrunchPad Kit, you can turn any laptop screen into a device that&#8217;s just as good, for a fraction of the price.Introducing The CrunchPad KitThe kit contains everything you need to convert any laptop screen into a fully functional touch screen device. The key piece of technology is a transparent resizable modular touch screen overlap material that you add to the screen after removing it from the rest of the laptop. You then install the remaining electronics, as well as a power supply, and the device is ready to go. Also included in each kit is a 4G module that you can optionally activate and add to the device for always-on connectivity.There&#8217;s real technology here, particularly in the touch module, that we&#8217;ve developed with our new partner. A number of patents have been filed around this new research, which we&#8217;re calling the F.U.J.J. With the F.U.J.J. you can convert any laptop screen of any size, up to 17 inches, into a CrunchPad.There&#8217;s more information in the video above, including a complete walk through of the five minute installation process. Order your CrunchPad Kit now, we expect to be completely sold out within 48 hours.Here&#8217;s one last picture of the Asian team we hired to help us build this product working on the F.U.J.J. from our office in Palo Alto after we sponsored their immigration visas to get them over here.CrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Netvibes CEO Freddy Mini announced today that the startup founded five years ago has finally made it to profitability.  The site has seen a lot of changes since then.  It began as one of the original Web 2.0 personalized homepages, became a distributed widget platform, changed CEOs (when founder Tariq Krim stepped down in 2008 to start Jolicloud), then started appealing to enterprises, brands, and advertisers with intranet offerings and social media dashboards.I chatted with Mini today, who says that the company is profitable on a net income basis.  He won&#8217;t go into details on revenues, but the company has 40 employees and two offices.  Just to cover salaries, it&#8217;s got to be pulling in a few million dollars a year.  Mini did break down the revenues by product line, however:Netvibes for Enterprise: 50%Netvibes Premium Dashboards: 40%Widget Distribution: 10%The enterprise version, which accounts for half of the company&#8217;s revenues, lets employees customize their intranet homepage with a mixture of company and personal widgets.  Think iGoogle for businesses.  The dashboards are more for advertising and PR agencies, who can use them to push media on an opt-in basis to interested consumers.   Netvibes also recently launched a Dashboarding Guide, which is a &#8220;dashboard of dashboards,&#8221; says Mini.  It pulls together different monitoring and analytics tools (such as Google Trends, Compete, Yelp, Hootsuite, and Trendrr) all into one dashboard.The consumer-oriented homepage now has 3.5 million visitors a month, and Netvibes continues to improve that experience with its new realtime stream reader Wasabi, but that the paying customers are businesses.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Following Kleiner Perkins&#8217; iFund &#8220;Doubling Down&#8221; event today, I got the chance to speak with iFund managing partner Matt Murphy. Simply put, Murphy, who also managed the first iFund, thinks the opportunity with the iPad will be huge â\\x80\\x94 potentially bigger than the first iFund. Obviously, Kleiner wouldn&#8217;t pump another $100 million into the fund if it didn&#8217;t believe that, but Murphy offered some insight into the firm&#8217;s thinking.While much of the focus has been on what the iPad will do as a consumer device, Murphy makes the case for how well it should work as a revenue-generating machine for the companies developing for it. He noted that of the 14 companies that are currently a part of the iFund (3 of which are in stealth mode), four of them are already profitable just two years after the fund&#8217;s launch. He attributes this to three main things: the freemium model, Apple&#8217;s payment structure, and micro-payments.One of those profitable companies is Shazam, the mobile music discovery service. The service noted today that it has seen over 15 million downloads on the iPhone (and iPod touch). Most of those are downloads of the free version of the app, but that free version has served as a gateway drug of sorts to get users hooked and eventually buying the premium version with more features. At $4.99, that paid version, Shazam Encore, is cheap enough that many users feel it is well worth the price.Perhaps more importantly, it&#8217;s so easy to download thanks to the App Store&#8217;s built-in payment structure. It&#8217;s one click, and the app is yours. And Murphy thinks we&#8217;re on the verge of an explosion in in-app payments thanks to that structure.One company, Booyah, which makes the popular location-based game MyTown (which we&#8217;ve covered quite a bit), is making good use of these in-app payments, Murphy notes. While the app is completely free, it allows users to buy upgrades within the game for small fees (ranging from $0.99 to $9.99). This is starting to take off, according to Murphy.He notes that while free apps on the Facebook platform convert users to paying customers at a 3% to 5% conversion rate, the iPhone is seeing that conversation in the 12% to 15% range. That&#8217;s a massive difference. And Murphy attributes it to the way payment ideas are presented in apps in combination with Apple&#8217;s easy payment structure that happens behind the scenes (the App Store tied to your credit card). When you see a new cheap feature in an app, &#8220;for $0.99 i&#8217;ll try that out,&#8221; Murphy notes. Those purchases are an afterthought.And the iPad will simply be an extension of all this, with the added potential benefit of even more in-app immersion. That&#8217;s what he sees as the iPad&#8217;s big benefit over the iPhone.Â\\xa0&#8221;We want someone who cracks the code on a more immersive experience,&#8221; Murphy says.And it&#8217;s important to note that this new iFund isn&#8217;t iPad-only. Â\\xa0Before the end of this year, Murphy says there will be some 100 million devices running the iPhone OS (currently, there are around 75 million), Kleiner will continue to look at all types of companies doing both iPhone and iPad apps to invest this money into.So what is he particularly excited about with regard to the iPad? Murphy reiterated John Doerr&#8217;s excitement about potential healthcare uses for the iPad and notes that they&#8217;re looking at one company in particular now that could come into fruition relatively soon (he wouldn&#8217;t say what it was). He also says that education is a potentially huge market for this new device.When I asked about the buzz surrounding old school media companies coming to the iPad, Murphy said that he was reluctant about some of the companies being hired to work on these solutions because it&#8217;s not long-term defensible. That said, there is at least one pure content play in stealth mode that Kleiner has backed with the fund. It involves a well-known entrepreneur, but Murphy wouldn&#8217;t say anymore.I asked why, given the success of the first iFund, Kleiner was &#8220;only&#8221; going with another $100 million for the fund? Why not go higher? Murphy noted that it&#8217;s likely just a starting point. For example, the original $100 million funded companies have seen some $330 million more pumped into them from outside the fund (yes, this is a bit skewed by Zynga, which just raised a massive $180 million new round). Murphy notes that this second iFund could be gone in as little as 12 months. It all depends on the quality of the companies sprouting up around the iPad (and continuing to sprout around the iPhone).Finally, I asked Murphy about an area both him and I are excited about: location. Murphy notes that three of the 14 iFund companies, Pelago (the makers of Whrrl), Booyah, and Shopkick (makers of CauseWorld), are location-based at their core. He went on to note that all the companies in this space are doing exciting things with check-ins because it&#8217;s ultimately important data. &#8220;Foot-streams are more valuable than click-streams,&#8221; Murphy notes, taking a line from Whrrl&#8217;s playbook.But Murphy notes that each of these companies is still searching for the Holy Grail: highly targeted location-based advertising. Once you understand that someone goes to Starbucks at a certain time everyday, you start to understand their behavior, and then ads become really interesting, he notes.In terms of the iPad, Murphy wonders what uses people will come up with with regard to location. After all, it&#8217;s not a phone that you have in your pocket, and you probably won&#8217;t be taking it to dinner (unless you&#8217;re really rude). Again, he thinks a company like Booyah, with its heavy game element that will drive the immersion idea could come up with some cool things. But he feels there will be new types of apps that give you a different reason for why you check-in with the iPad.In general, even within Kleiner Perkins, the iPad seems to be the undiscovered country. And that&#8217;s breeding a lot of excitement. Among the partners, there is no doubt that it won&#8217;t be long before there&#8217;s the first huge app for it. But it&#8217;s hard to base that off of pitches without the device itself out there. &#8220;You won&#8217;t know it until you see it,&#8221; Murphy says.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google has acquired a company that has created a new process for highly efficient isotope separation, we&#8217;ve confirmed from multiple sources. The primary use of this technology, say experts we&#8217;ve spoken with, is uranium enrichment.Enriched uranium is a necessary ingredient in the creation of nuclear energy, and one source we&#8217;ve spoken with at Google says that this is part of the Google Green Initiative. The company will use the new technology to enable it to design and possibly build small, mobile and highly efficient nuclear power generators. &#8220;Google has already begun building an enrichment plant,&#8221; says a high ranking IAEA source.As GreenBeat points out, &#8220;Google finally decided to launch a dedicated unit of the company for designing and building its own solar panels, wind turbines, energy efficiency devices, etc. So far, its green efforts have been pursued by separate projects within the company. Nuclear is an obvious next step for the company.&#8221;GreenBeat first broke the story (first titled Google Has A Big Alternate Energy Announcement Forthcoming) after seeing multiple tweets about the impending announcement.But other sources we&#8217;ve spoken with say Google has no real intention of pursuing nuclear energy, despite the fact that the company has promoted the use of alternate energy sources for years. Of particular concern is the fact that the company Google acquired is based outside of the U.S., and little is known about the new enrichment technology they&#8217;ve developed.Nuclear power generation is a highly regulated industry. And enriched uranium is a particularly sensitive topic and creation and distribution of the substance is highly controlled. Enriched uranium can also be used for nuclear weapons production, which is why the industry is so highly regulated.Says one source: &#8220;The story Google is putting out there is that the new technology will be built for clean energy production. But all of the research and development they&#8217;re doing in this area is being conducted outside of the U.S., and the enrichment facility is also outside of the U.S.&#8221;And more chillingly: &#8220;It would be trivial for anyone with this technology to build a nuclear weapon.&#8221;Google, which has been shaken by its inability to counter Chinese censorship and hacking efforts, may be engaging in enrichment research as part of a new effort to  simply protect itself from outside threats.One source pointed out that if Google were its own country, its revenues would place it at 74th on the list of countries sorted by gross domestic product. &#8220;The U.S. government clearly won&#8217;t protect Google from China, so Google is taking the logical step of protecting itself with a physical deterrent.&#8221;To be clear, most of this is speculation. All we&#8217;ve confirmed is that Google has acquired a company with a new enrichment process and that they have begun researching small, nuclear portable generators. But there is real evidence here that Google may be working on something much more sinister to counter the China threat. More as this develops.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When Google wants to try out a new consumer-facing product, it usually puts it in Google Labs.  That is where experimental products can be found. There are separate Labs for Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Search, and YouTube (although sometimes they are called &#8220;experiments&#8221; or &#8220;TestTube&#8221;).  Now Google Ads has its own Labs, which it is calling Ad Innovations.  It is a central place where advertisers can &#8220;explore new marketing technologies.&#8221;Some of the highlighted technologies include Google&#8217;s new remarketing option, which shows ads to people who have visited the advertiser&#8217;s Website as they visit other sites that serve up Google ads.  Another feature highlighted on the Ad Innovations page is Google&#8217;s new Search Funnels analytics tool, which shows advertisers the history of interactions with their ads leading up to a click.  The online advertising industry is trying to prove to advertisers that even ads that don&#8217;t get clicked on can lead to conversions.  Search Funnels is Google&#8217;s way of making that argument.   The page also highlights product listing ads, special YouTube ads, and mobile click-to-call ads.It&#8217;s about time Google&#8217;s advertising products got their own Labs.  But hopefully ad products that don&#8217;t work won&#8217;t be allowed to linger around as long as some of the consumer stuff in Google Labs proper.  We&#8217;re talking about products designed to make money here, after all.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This morning, we broke the news that YouTube would be rolling out its new, streamlined Watch page to all users.  The aptly named page is the all-important portion of the site where you actually watch videos (it also features comments, ratings, and related videos).  At an event at YouTube headquarters this morning, three of the key people involved with the launch â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Senior Product Manager Shiva Rajaraman, UI designer Julian Fumar, and engineer Igor Kofman â\\x80\\x94 walked us through some of the changes in the new design, the logic behind them, and some of the early results they&#8217;ve seen.We first saw the new Watch page in January, when the site started allowing users to opt-in to it.  To test the new design, YouTube also rolled it out to around 10% of its users.  Among those users, YouTube says that it has see a rise in engagement  (which includes actions like ratings and leaving comments) by 7%, and an increase in the number of videos watched by 6%.  Those may not sound like huge numbers, but given that this is the world&#8217;s most popular video site, that translates into a lot of extra views.So what changed?  In short, everything is much cleaner.  The YouTube team said that in 2009 the site added more features than they had in the two previous years combined, and things were getting cluttered. So they&#8217;ve decided to prune the hedges.As we detailed when the redesign first become available, Â\\xa0the new site has streamlined the page header to place a much greater emphasis on search.  It has also abandoned YouTube&#8217;s long-standing five star rating system in favor of a binary thumbs up/thumbs down system (a change that YouTube has discussed for months).Less obvious changes: the &#8216;more info&#8217; button, which used to be a bizarrely small link nestled under the video description, is now positioned directly under the video, with a much larger clickable area.  The video uploader&#8217;s screenname is now more prominently featured above the video, as is the &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; button (there will be an opportunity for YouTube partners to brand this area). The related videos listing, which makes up the page&#8217;s right column, will now be more consistently positioned.  And you can now access the site&#8217;s detailed viewing statistics simply by clicking on the viewcount (these used to be tucked under a &#8217;stats&#8217; menu).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Today at the Rosewood Sandhill Hotel in Menlo Park, CA,Â\\xa0Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers hosted an event surrounding a &#8220;mobile content revolution.&#8221; The famous venture capital firm was tight-lipped about what this event would actually be about, but the speculation leading up to the event was that it may involve Apple&#8217;s new iPad, which is being launched in the U.S. on Saturday. Sure enough, it was.Kleiner Perkins today announced the doubling (or &#8220;doubling down&#8221; as partner John Doerr put it) of its iFund to $200 million. Initially, this includes more than a dozen iPad applications due in May from portfolio companies. In March of 2008 as Apple was unveiling itsÂ\\xa0iPhone SDK, Kleiner Perkins unveiled the firstÂ\\xa0iFund, a $100 million fund to spur iPhone app development.iFund portfolio companies at the event included Booyah, Cooliris, GOGII, InMobi, ngmoco, Pinger, Shazam, shopkick, and Zynga. In total, there are 14 ventures in the iFund now, 3 of which are in stealth mode. &#8220;They&#8217;re kicking ass,&#8221; Doerr notes.In fact, the iFund companies have produced apps that have seen 100 million total downloads, Doerr notes. And those companies are expected to pull in some $100 million in revenues this year. Four of the companies are already profitable, partner Matt Murphy notes. The problem is that with the success, the iFund is out of money â\\x80\\x94 Kleiner Perkins actually raised an additional $330 million to pump into these companies outside of the initial iFund investment. And there&#8217;s this new device coming out&#8230;&#8220;On the eve of the iPad, the iFund is out of money,&#8221; Doerr said. Hence, the doubling of the fund.There are over 20 applications for the iPad currently in development under the iFund. 11 of those will launch on Saturday with the iPad itself. Doerr seems particularly excited about one of the stealth ones (which he wouldn&#8217;t talk about specifically) that rolling out in 5 weeks, that will be iPad-only.Below, find my live notes (paraphrased):John Doerr: Just 15 years ago in 1994 there was no Internet. There was no browser. Steve Jobs had left Apple he was working on Toy Story and NeXT. That year I saw Mosiac, the first web browser. It was magic. The rest of the 90s was a great experience. All those companies came around. Silicon Valley was a Florence of the&#8220;It feels like Deja Vu all over again. Twice in a lifetime.&#8221;A tsumani of cellphones have swept the world &#8211; now 3 billion have them. Including people in far reaches of Africa. There are 75 times more cellphones in Kenya than PCs. In 4 years there will be 32 million cell phones there. Everyone is going to have the Internet and a cell phone in their pockets.A few years ago Steve Jobs rocked the world with the iPhone.Â\\xa0&#8221;If you can&#8217;t invent the future, the next best way is to fund it.&#8221;Think back to March 6, 2008, the iFund was a little risky. There was no iPhone 3G. We now have 14 ventures in the iFund, 3 are stealth. 8 of them are here today. They&#8217;re kicking ass.There are 100 million downloads, and there will be over $100 million in revenues from these companies this year.Â\\xa0We&#8217;ve raised $330 million raised for them. But on the eve of the iPad, the iFund is out of money.Â\\xa0To quote Bill Campbell, &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta have the fucking money.&#8221; So we&#8217;re doubling down the iFund to $200 million.This Saturday the iPad arrives, we believe it&#8217;s going to rule the world. I&#8217;ve held it, caressed it. It feels like you&#8217;re touching the future (Doerr stole that from me).We&#8217;re going into a brave new world. From the old world of Windows interfaces to touch. The swoosh of liquidity. The iPad is direct, it&#8217;s natural. WYTIWis &#8212; what you touch, is what is.Ron Okamoto, VP developer relations, Apple:Two year&#8217;s ago, John went out on a limb. Now it&#8217;s a tree. WIth the iPad, this is going to be big. We have 100,000 developers making over 150,000 apps that have been downloaded 3 billion times. That&#8217;s in just 24 months. With the iPad, it&#8217;s going to be even bigger.You&#8217;ve gotta have a cool name to be funded by Kleiner (laughs).Â\\xa0We&#8217;ve seen what developers are working on so far, it&#8217;s fantastic. In a few days, you&#8217;ll see it too.Doerr back on stage100,000 flowers blooming. The tablet is where all these dreams are going to come true. This is going to start a third Renaissance in software. This will be a new interconnected, interactive world. This future will transform all fields (healthcare, etc). Over the next decade 3 times better battires in 10 times better powered chips.Â\\xa0You&#8217;ll have a terabyte of local fast storage soon.I&#8217;ve always been awed by entrepreneurs. Let&#8217;s talk to the guys working in the iFund.Bing Gordon, Kleiner PerkinsI have no prepared remarks. Twas the night before iPad &#8211; nothing was stirring, except the whole family trying to throw away their mouse. I&#8217;m going to make a prediction. Many centuries ago the writing body language. 50 years ago, the typewriter body language. Then the iPhone body language. Now the iPad body language.Greg Woock, CEO PingerI&#8217;ve been with a lot of companies, nothing has been as successful as with the iPhone. We have paid apps and free apps. Many different business models &#8211; in app adds, in app purchases. We&#8217;ve done 13 titles, 10 have been in the top 100. Largely because we use our apps to sell other apps. If you&#8217;re not in the top 100 apps, it&#8217;s hard to be seen.Â\\xa0We&#8217;re profitable &#8211; in a year, really in 9 months!So the iPad: The strongest thing I can saw is that my daughter immediately knew she wanted one. We&#8217;re making Doodle Buddy for the iPad. The most fun you can have with your hand (rather than your finger (with the iPhone).Keith Lee, BooyahWhen we saw the iPhone, we knew we had to leave our jobs at Blizzard. Camera, GPS, this was huge for new experiences. 4 months ago we launched MyTown. It&#8217;s the most popular location-based social game. It&#8217;s realworld Monopoly. We&#8217;ve been able to hit 1.6 million registered users. 130,000 new users a week. We&#8217;ve always been in the top 50 of the charts. People spending 70 million a day (per user) in our game. We have 4 million daily check-ins.Alex Musil, ShazamWe are in over 200 countries, we have 50 million users, we&#8217;re getting 750,000 new users added every week. There are 2 million tags a day. Over 15 million downloads on the iPhone. Had a top 50 ranking since we&#8217;ve been live in the App Store. And we&#8217;ll be on the iPad as well. It&#8217;s not just going to be a big iPhone app, it&#8217;s a new experience. You&#8217;ll see it on Saturday.Neil Young, ngmocoWe believed the iPhone could revolutionize mobile gaming, and the iFund backed us early. We&#8217;ve have over 30,000,000 downloads of our software. We&#8217;ve had 15 top 10 (total) apps. We Rule is huge now. We run the plus network, over 20,000,000 downloads of those games. Every single day users play over 20 million minutes of ngmoco games.The iPad will revolutionize gaming in the home. The iPad radically reshapes the way you interact with software. We&#8217;ll have 7 applications available at the launch of the iPad. All built specifically for the iPad. And yes, We Rule is coming to the iPad.Zack Norman, GOGIItextPlus is a next generation messaging platform. It blows up the relationship between the telephone and text messaging. 15 million messages a day. 2 billion messages since our launch. Our users are using 65 minutes a day on average. 5.5 million users.But the iPad will change everything &#8211; because it&#8217;s not a phone. It&#8217;s more like the iPod touch. The use cases have yet to be written and imagines. Text is a voice of a generation &#8211; other generations are coming with them. I think this new device will be huge for text messaging (again, without the phone part).Bing Gordon backZynga and Cooliris and Shopkick are also here to answer questions. We&#8217;ll do Q&amp;A in a minutes. Gordon reading a poem about the iPhone (yes, really).Q&amp;A TimeQ: How many companies in the iFund are profitable? Is the iPad a bigger opportunity than the iPhone?A (Matt Murphy from overseas): 4 companies right now are profitable, we&#8217;re not disclosing which ones. Cash-flow profitable for sure.The panel is split as to weather they&#8217;ll raise app prices for the iPad. Some will stay free, some won&#8217;t raise prices.A (Neil Young): It&#8217;s early days for the iPad, there are 75 million iPhone (and iPod touch) devices out there. The iPad will engage users for more time than the iPhone we think. I think living room gaming is going to have some competition from the iPad. Same with desktop gaming.A (Bing Gordon): I think the iPad market will be bigger than apps on the iPhone.Q: Could the iPad be bigger than the iPhone?A (John Doerr): I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know what apps are going to be built, but let me tell you about some I think about. I think every doctor and nurse will use an iPad. I don&#8217;t think we can anticipate the great new uses.Q: Is there a bigger business opportunity for tablet computing in general?A (Bing Gordon): The money from the iFund can be used for development on other platforms too.Q: What percent of revenue will be from iPhone or iPad?A (from the panel): It&#8217;s going to be most of it. The iTunes aspect is key, it&#8217;s a great infrastructure. Most of us are still a drop in the bucket in terms of how big we can grow. Apple has an incredible lead in the space right now. Calling the iPad a tablet is kind of like calling the iPhone a cellphone &#8212; it&#8217;s so much more.Q: 2 years from now what percent of usages is on the iPhone?A (Cooliris): We only have an app on the iPhoneA (Shopkick): Same with CauseWorld, majority is iPhone.A (Zynga): Big and growing.Q: What as the biggest surprise for developing on iPad?A (from the panel): The first iteration of the SDK was really complete, which was great. The iPad is not a big iPod touch &#8212; that misses the point. When you&#8217;re playing with it, you forget you&#8217;re using something. You no longer think about the interactions you&#8217;re doing, you just do. You have to touch it to understand. Mobile software is built around, when you got a second, you use it. But the iPad is more of a lean-back experience. It&#8217;s clearly not a bigger iPod touch. The device is magic. It will change the way normal human beings feel about computing.Q: So how long until the first non-iPhone killer apps?A: Insider 6 months I think you&#8217;ll see the first of those. If you wanted to build the killer app for the Xbox 360, it would take you two years. For the iPhone and iPad, it can happen so quickly.A (from Doerr): Within 5 weeks one of the stealth ventures is going to roll out an app that&#8217;s iPad-only. And quickly we&#8217;ll see education apps which will transform things.Q: What about Apple&#8217;s closed platform versus the Android open platform?A (Doerr): There are two different philosphies. The iPhone got there first, but each will make the other better. I don&#8217;t know which is going to win.Q: Is there something in stealth with healthcare?A: No comment.Q: Will there be many new ideas for healthcare?A: I can&#8217;t wait to see what we get.Gordon: So thank you for coming over. That&#8217;s a wrap.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'SharesPost, a private equity market that allows employees and founders to convert some of their shares into cash launched a publication platform to include reports that give greater insight into the valuations of companies like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. We examined  last year&#8217;s report, which estimated Facebook&#8217;s valuation between $4 to $6 million. Today&#8217;s report pegs Facebook&#8217;s valuation at around $9 billion, which is higher than last year&#8217;s number but lower than the $10 billion valuation the social network earned during its latest funding round last year. The report, which is you can access here, estimates Facebook&#8217;s current valuation between $8.4 and $9 billion after using two methods of analysis comparing revenues with steady-state enterprise valuation ($9 billion) and comparative enterprise valuation ($8.4 billion). The steady-state valuation estimates use a 25x market multiple and normalized net margins of 30%. Assuming that Facebook will make $2.5 billion in 2014, the report arrives at a target 2010 enterprise value of $9 billion. For the comparative valuation,  the report uses a secular growth rate of 25% and EBITDA margins of 50%, to arrive at a conservative valuation of $8.4 billion (assuming the company&#8217;s revenue to be $1.3 billion in 2011.)SharesPost&#8217;s report estimates that Facebook is currently burning through $200 &#8211; $300M of cash a year for its operational expenses and for capacity expansion, and is cash-flow positive, which we knew. The report highlights Facebook&#8217;s 400 million users and its dominance as the world&#8217;s largest social network, wide network of developers building off the platform, and the amount of ecommerce and advertising revenue flowing through the network. For example, Zynga spends between $5 million and $8 million per month on advertising on Facebook. The report estimates that Facebook&#8217;s revenue for 2010 will hit $1 billion and nearly $3 billion by 2015, another stat that we&#8217;ve heard before. \\tSharesPost also released a report on the valuation of Twitter, estimating that the microblogging network is worth $750 million. Strangely, SharesPost&#8217;s recently-launched Venture-Backed Index has Facebook&#8217;s valuation listed at nearly $12 billion. We&#8217;ve contacted SharesPost for comment on this discrepancy.

Publisher Network as easy as possible&#8221;.Update: it&#8217;s legit, alright. Here&#8217;s the full email:Dear Publisher,Yahoo! continuously evaluates and prioritizes our products and services, in alignment with business goals and our continued commitment to deliver the best consumer and advertiser experiences. After conducting an extensive review of the Yahoo! Publisher Network beta program, we have decided to close the program effective April 30, 2010. We expect to deliver final publisher payments for the month ending April 30, 2010 to publishers no later than May 31, 2010. All publishers eligible for 1099s for the 2010 tax year will have those mailed by January 31, 2011.Because our content will no longer be delivered to your ad unit spaces after April 30, 2010, we recommend removing all YPN ad code from your pages by that date.For the opportunity to continue earning revenue, we suggest using Chitika, a leading advertising network that syndicates Yahoo! Content Match and Sponsored Search ads. Chitika has set up a special process for YPNO beta publishers to participate in its platform. Click here for more information.We thank you for your participation in the Yahoo! Publisher Network beta. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact our Support Team at (866) 785-2636, Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PDT.Sincerely,Your Partners at Yahoo!The YPN blog remains silent about the axing, so far. We have e-mails in with both Chitika and Yahoo for more information.One thing I&#8217;m trying to figure out is why Yahoo doesn&#8217;t refer publishers to its search partner Microsoft instead, who operates adCenter.For background: the Yahoo! Publisher Network (aka YPN) was launched in August 2005 and has been labeled a beta product by Yahoo up until today. It provided registered publishers with cost-per-click contextual advertising as well as various tools and services to assist them in building and improving their websites.Chitika handily provided publishers with a FAQ page for more information about switching to them.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Depending on the method, it comes up with a range of valuations from $656 million (by comparing Twitter&#8217;s estimated enterprise value to comparable companies) to $751 million (by estimating revenues, margins, and a discount rate).  It is all pretty much guesswork since Twitter still doesn&#8217;t know where the bulk of its revenues will come from. But the report makes a stab at projecting revenues of $45 million in 2010 going to $170 million in 2014.  It notes various sources of potential revenue in order of decreasing likelihood, starting with licensing its data feed to search engines (which is where most of its revenue is coming from today) and creating premium accounts for businesses (something else it has already dabbled in).  Other options for making money: charging third party apps based on how much API data they use, premium accounts for heavy individual users (limited potential), Web ads on user profiles, or ads in Tweets (these could alienate users).The best bet for Twitter to make money, says the report, is to continue to become a marketing channel for businesses and start charging for leads.  The opt-in model of people following businesses and brands should result in much higher sales per lead than other marketing channels such as email marketing, telemarketing, or bulk SMS marketing.  Businesses who use Twitter for social media marketing purposes tend to have many more followers than normal users and also Tweet more often.Another nice chart in the report show how Twitter&#8217;s uptime has improved since its early days (other than when it is under a denial of service attack), And the report confirms that most Twitter users are passive readers rather than active posters.  As I&#8217;ve long suspected, people on Twitter tend to consume more than they Tweet.  About 68 percent of users login at least once a month, but only 17 percent Tweet.  (Although, they do tend to start Tweeting more once they&#8217;ve been on the service for 9 months or longer).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'WePay, a Y Combinator backed startup that aims to take the hassle out of group paying, is launching to the public today. As we wrote in our initial coverage  of the payments platform, WePay is an easy way to collect, manage and spend money for groups. WePay&#8217;s core architecture is based around a prepaid debit card system, which makes its accounts not only easy to set up but also more flexible when it comes to setting up group paying. So with PayPal, your account is tied to your name, without any way to separate the payments associated with a group. On WePay, you can create a unique, FDIC insured account for each group. While the account is still associated with your name, but you can keep each group account totally separate from your personal transactions. Group money can essentially be kept separate from any individual accounts you may have. You can also designate specific individuals to have control over accounts. From accounts on WePay, users can send emails with electronic bills (which can be paid with bank accounts or credit cards) and spend funds with a WePay VISA prepaid card, paper checks, or electronically. If group members donâ\\x80\\x99t pay soon, the site will automatically remind them a few days later. WePay makes money by charging a 3.5% transaction fee (thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a different plan that charges 50 cents per transaction and limits you on the methods of payment you can accept). The site has been in private beta for the past six months but has received positive feed back from its limited number of users.Co-founder Bill Clerico likens PayPal to the payment equivalent of email (meaning its more targeted towards exchanging information or money between two separate parties) and WePay as the payment equivalent of Facebook, in that there is one central place for everyone to see the latest information, and payments are exchanged between many parties. As we wrote in December, all signs point to WePay being a winner, and viable competitor to PayPal in the group payments space. And a number of notable investors and technology executives seems to think so as well. In addition to funding from Y Combinator, the site has raised $1.65 million from August Capital and angel investors, including PayPal cofounder Max Levchin, PayPal alum Dave McClure, FriendFeed co-founder Paul Buchheit, Ron Conway, Mark Goines, Andrew McCollum, Joe Campanelli, and Angus Davis.

       "  'comments_content': 'Paris-based Semiocast, which helps brands understand and interact with real-time Web services, has again done a study on Twitter usage. After finding that only 50% of tweets are in English, based on an analysis of 2.8 million tweets, the company has now looked at nearly five times as many Twitter messages in order to gain more insight on the increased international presence of the popular micro-sharing service.According to an analysis of 13.5 million tweets published over the course of one week, Semiocast concluded that users located in the United States account for only thirty percent of all tweets. The next English-speaking country on the list comes in fifth, with only 6 percent of tweets analyzed originating from the United Kingdom.Top countries are the U.S., Japan, Brazil, Indonesia and the UK, in that order.Semiocast says only 0.5% of tweets appear to come geo-tagged. In order to establish the share of countries more accurately, the company also processed tweets and self-declared locations in bios from users with the help of its multi-lingual semantic technology platform, effectively parsing the locations of Twitter users as good as possible.Semiocast says the strongest growth rate was not registered in the United States, where Twitter is headquartered, but in other regions around the world. Furthermore, English now accounts for less than 44% of tweets, down from 50% merely six weeks ago.Japan, where Twitter has been actively bolstering its presence for the past two years now, is the second largest tweeting nation, accounting for about 15% of messages worldwide. The third largest Twitter nation is Brazil, with nearly 12% of messages worldwide, which translates to about 6.2 million messages per day. Indonesia, where Twitter is big thanks to partnerships with local carriers, ranks fourth with 10% of messages worldwide or about 5 million messages on a daily basis.Overall, the sample of tweets analyzed is fairly small, considering that today, an estimated 53 million tweets are published on a daily basis, up from 50 million per day in February 2010. Nevertheless, other companies who&#8217;ve analyzed the internationalization of Twitter in the past have come to similar conclusions: the growth rate of tweets is clearly accelerating outside the United States, and the share of Twitter messages originating from the company&#8217;s home country is getting smaller every day. Even Twitter investor Fred Wilson has written about that trend on his blog last weekend.For more context, Sysomos has published research findings on this topic before. In January 2010, the company looked at 13 million active Twitter accounts from mid-October to mid-December 2009 and found that 50.8% of Twitter activity came from the U.S., followed by Brazil (8.79%), the U.K. (7.2%), Canada (4.35%) and Germany (2.49%). Japan was 10th at 1.22%. That was a sharp drop compared to the 62.1% share in the United Stated Sysomos registered in June 2009.How long until Japan, Indonesia or Brazil takes the lead at the expense of the United States?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Following the location-based frenzy that took place at this year&#8217;s SXSW festival, my colleague MG Siegler highlighted a definitive issue when it comes to checking in on various social networks like FourSquare, Gowalla, Loopt and others. The problem is that each of these check-in services has their own places database, which means that a place on Foursquare may be slightly different than a place on Gowalla, even though theyâ\\x80\\x99re technically the same place. Moreover, within many location-based social networks, there are duplicates for some venues since people are allowed to create their own. Location-based advertising and marketing service Placecast is hoping to resolve this problem by launching its Match API, Rosetta Stone like-database for location venue data. Placecast&#8217;s free Match API will enables location content providers and location-based application developers to refer to a location in any number of ways, and validate that those references resolve to one true location for each check-in. In more simple terms, the API will take duplicate listings for a venue and combine them into one listing. The API translates data across services and matches it for accuracy, regardless of the ID system. And because the Placecast Match API is an open system, Placecastâ\\x80\\x99s Match API enables companies working with location data to use any (or multiple) ID system and resolve to one true location. For example, if I check-in to  the lobby of the Hilton Hotel and a friend checks into the restaurant at the Hilton Hotel, the Match API would resolve these and show both as the same location and check-in venue.

Ummm&#8230; so Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray, the guy who was right about the iPad because he wouldn&#8217;t shut up about it for most of the last five years, is saying there&#8217;s a &#8220;70% chance&#8221; that Apple will build a search engine. Barring thought that Apple needs to run a search engine like a fish needs to run a bicycle factory, let&#8217;s look at what he&#8217;s saying (via BusinessInsider)We believe Apple could utilize data unavailable to Google, data generated by the company&#8217;s App Store, to create a mobile centric search engine, which would be a unique offering to Google&#8217;s search engine.An iPhone specific search engine could be a difficult undertaking, but we feel Apple could make a minor acquisition of a search company that has built a web index, like a Cuil, and utilize the index as the base for building its own engine.We believe the odds of Apple developing a search engine in the next five years are 70%. One hurdle for Apple in developing its own search engine would be generating enough advertiser interest to form a competitive marketplace; however, we believe the rationale for an Apple search product is to protect data rather than generate profit.While I rarely enjoy point-by-point takedowns, I&#8217;m feeling rather frisky on this one. Let&#8217;s begin:1. We believe Apple could utilize data unavailable to Google, data generated by the company&#8217;s App Store, to create a mobile centric search engine. &#8211; So this would search for popular Apps? Is that a &#8220;search engine&#8221; or a Genius system for apps. I suspect the latter. Maybe Gene didn&#8217;t get the the right term when he checked his Webster&#8217;s Dictionary of Computer Terms he bought in college.2. we feel Apple could make a minor acquisition of a search company that has built a web index, like a Cuil &#8211; Remember Cuil? Well no one else does. Apparently someone mentioned Cuil at Munster&#8217;s bridge club tournament after reading about it an an old 2008 issue of Fast Company they found in the dentist&#8217;s office and it stuck. Someone could have said AltaVista and the same thing could have happened.3. One hurdle for Apple in developing its own search engine would be generating enough advertiser interest &#8211; Because who wouldn&#8217;t want to work arm-in-arm a distant, far-from-mainstream search contender dedicated to sifting the ether for data on Hot Tub Time Machine soundboards?4. we believe the rationale for an Apple search product is to protect data rather than generate profit. &#8211; Now this one is rich. Apparently Smith &#038; Wollensky had two-for-one martini night and Munster&#8217;s dining partner &#8211; the one who probably planted this seed in the first place &#8211; apparently partook. &#8220;Protect data rather than generate profit&#8221; sounds exactly like something Apple would do. After all, they&#8217;re in the business of making things better for all of us. If you haven&#8217;t visited the Apple Health Centers where they can cure future brain embolisms by bathing you in purple light, you&#8217;re missing out. Just don&#8217;t take their flu vaccine.I hate to single anyone out &#8211; we all make crazy proclamations, especially when we&#8217;re hopped up on Skittles and chocolate milk (not naming names) &#8211; but WTF? This is more egregious than usual, friends. Analysts know little more than we do, and that&#8217;s not saying much.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This Saturday, Apple will be releasing the iPad to the masses, and you can be sure that one of the first things people will do when they get their hands on the device is explore what awaits them on the App Store.   For anyone who regularly uses Google Docs in the workplace, one of the most appealing apps is likely going to be Memeo&#8217;s Connect Reader, which will allow users to download and natively view all of their Google Docs files on their iPads.  We got a sneak peek at the free application, which will launch the same day as the iPad.The application allows users of any Google Docs account (be it normal or Premiere) to automatically download and store their Docs, which they can then view using the iPad&#8217;s document viewer that&#8217;s been integrated into Memeo&#8217;s app.  The viewer supports a range of popular formats, including Office, Apple&#8217;s iWork formats, and docs created in Google&#8217;s online editor (which are downloaded as HTML to preserve formatting).So why is this important?  First, given the current battle waging between Apple and Google, it&#8217;s unlikely that Apple would even approve a Google-made Docs app at all. Â\\xa0But Google Docs is popular enough that it would be unwise for Apple to ban the service from the iPad entirely â\\x80\\x94 users would just make the jump to the upcoming Google tablets. Â\\xa0MemeoÂ\\xa0thinks that it and other independent third parties are well positioned in the current situation, as they&#8217;ll be able to provide services to bridge this gap. Â\\xa0It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that Steve Jobs allegedly sent an email stating that the iPad would support importing Google Docs to the iPad through iWork or iDisk.We last wrote about Memeo in January, when Google started allowing users to upload any type of file to Google Docs, effectively allowing them to use it for online storage.  Memeo was one of Google&#8217;s preferred partners for the launch, and their desktop sync software has already been adopted by 40% of Google&#8217;s enterprise customers (defined as companies with 1000+ seats).

       "  'comments_content': 'Realtime streams are quickly moving from the consumer Web to the enterprise.  The constant flow of status updates, links, and shared items people are becoming accustomed to on Facebook and Twitter is finding its way into enterprise apps like Socialcast, Yammer, and Salesforce Chatter.  Investors are betting on this trend.  Socialcast is getting an $8 million cash infusion from Menlo Ventures and True Ventures in a Series B financing.  In February, 2010, competitor Yammer raised a $10 million Series B.Socialcast previously got $1.4 million from True Ventures and angels a year ago.  Blogger Om Malik of GigaOm, who is also a VC partner at True, sits on Socialcast&#8217;s board.  He will be joined by Menlo&#8217;s Sonja Hoel Perkins.  The startup&#8217;s service combines a corporate activity stream that ties into CRM and ERP systems with social bookmarking, Outlook and SharePoint integrations, mobile (iPhone and Blackberry) and desktop (Air) apps, and analytics.  Co-workers can share knowledge and updates in a semi-private setting.  Socialcast moved to a freemium model last summer, offering the basic service for free, and charging for upgrades and premium features.  The company offers both hosted and behind-the-firewall options.  It boasts 7,000 corporate customers, including Guitar Center, turner Broadcasting, and Avaya, and an 1,100 percent growth in users from a year ago (albeit off of a small base).  Yammer, by comparison, claims to power 60,000 corporate networks.  The realtime enterprise is obviously a growth industry.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'No, we&#8217;re not becoming a celebrity blog (yet) but the noteworthy thing is that it&#8217;s incredibly hard for technology companies to even buy this kind of publicity: Ancestry.com researchers have found that actress Ellen DeGeneres is apparently related to pop star Madonna.Genealogists employed by the company, which offers a subscription-based Web service that allows people to study families and the tracing of their lineages and history, have discovered that the women are 11th cousins.The family history experts uncovered that the pair is related through a common 10th great-grandfather â\\x80\\x93 a Frenchman named Martin Aucoin, whose daughters Jeanne and Michele left their native country of France to settle in Nova Scotia in the early 1600s. DeGeneres&#8217;s family supposedly left Canada in the late 1700s when her 5th great-grandfather Joseph Martin relocated to Louisiana. It wasn&#8217;t until the late 1870s that Madonna&#8217;s 2nd great-grandmother Emilie Daniel left Quebec and moved to Michigan, where the singer herself calls home.If true (or maybe regardless thereof), this is a publicity boon for Ancestry.com, which went public in November and currently boasts a $721 million market cap. No doubt, it will make a lot of people who pick up on the claimed family ties between the two entertainment giants wonder what the site is all about and give it a try themselves.Sadly, the company is pushing it a bit too far by quoting genealogist Anastasia Tyler as follows:&#8220;It&#8217;s not every day you discover two celebrity icons are related, but it&#8217;s their similarities that make the connection so extraordinary. They were born the same year, have both written books and been on tour, are known for their impressive dance moves â\\x80\\x93 and with Ellen&#8217;s latest gig on American Idol â\\x80\\x93 are both legendary figures on the music scene.&#8221;Meh. Would have been better to simply stick to the facts, people.This isn&#8217;t exactly the first time Ancestry.com have uncovered family connections between celebrities: in 2009, they connected financier Warren Buffett to President Barack Obama.Are you related to anyone famous?

But we don&#8217;t have to Google to thank for itÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94 it&#8217;s coming from doubleTwist, the syncing software that allows you to sync your media with Android phones (it also supports myriad other devices).  The new feature is launching today with the latest update of doubleTwist for Mac, and will be included with the Windows version soon.  doubleTwist is also offering a web version of its Android Market directory, which you can access at http://apps.doubletwist.com.I&#8217;ve made no secret of my dislike for the current version of Google&#8217;s official web presence for Android Market â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it offers a sampling of Android&#8217;s top apps, but it&#8217;s ugly and doesn&#8217;t offer a full listing of what&#8217;s available (it doesn&#8217;t even offer a search function).  There are some third-party web directories, like AndroidLib, but these don&#8217;t offer the slick feel you get from a desktop application.  doubleTwist comes closer than either of these options to matching the iTunes browsing experience, but it still isn&#8217;t perfect.The Android Market integration looks quite nice. Clicking the menu item in the left sidebar brings up a list of the top featured, paid, and free applications on Android Market.  And, unlike Google&#8217;s official Market site, you can actually search using doubleTwist&#8217;s version.  Clicking on an app will bring up its description, screen shots, and reviews â\\x80\\x94 it looks a lot like the iTunes App Store interface, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing.However,Â\\xa0doubleTwist&#8217;s Market integration comes with a couple of issues.  First, it doesn&#8217;t include any application categories, like &#8216;Games&#8217; or &#8216;Communication&#8217; (though this seems like it would be a fairly minor addition).  The other issue is more problematic: you can&#8217;t actually use doubleTwist to download and sync applications to your Android device.  Instead, each entry on the Market features a QR code that you have to scan from your phone to bring up the appropriate item in Android Market.doubleTwist co-founder Monique Farantzos says that the company plans to offer Over The Air downloads this summer (which would let you send apps to your device without having to bother with this QR code nonsense), and that the company has also approached Google about a way to make the experience more integrated and seamless. Still, even without OTA downloads, the Market integration looks slick.Alongside today&#8217;s update, doubleTwist is also releasing a web version of its podcast directory, which launched earlier this month (you can see a screenshot of the search directory below).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The rumors keep circulating. The latest came yesterday when the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was working on a CDMA version of the iPhone. To most people, that means one thing. No, not a Sprint version of the iPhone (though I suppose that&#8217;s possible too), a Verizon version of the iPhone.The problem is that these rumors have been circulating almost as long as the actual iPhone itself. And the WSJ report isn&#8217;t exactly a slam dunk by only citing the ever-anonymous &#8220;people briefed by the company.&#8221; But, more so than ever, the timing does appear to be right for Apple to break its AT&amp;T exclusivity.First of all, this Verizon iPhone would not launch alongside the other new iPhone hardware due this Summer. The WSJ report has manufacturing on the CDMA iPhone ramping up in September, but also notes that the phones may not be available to consumers immediately. This means at the earliest, we&#8217;re looking at a Fall release, or possibly even a holiday release for the device (if not later depending on several factors). That means that AT&amp;T would still get the supposed &#8220;iPhone HD&#8221; all to itself for several months at least.Then you&#8217;d have to wonder if Apple would dare announce that it would be bringing the iPhone to other carriers &#8220;later this year&#8221; at its WWDC event (where it traditionally launches the new iPhone hardware)? If they did that, they risk people sitting out for several months, waiting for the Verizon version to hit before buying an iPhone. They&#8217;d be putting customers in a tight spot: do you upgrade to the sleek new hardware now, locking yourself into a new 2-year contract with AT&amp;T? Or do you wait? If Apple in in fact planning a CDMA version of the iPhone, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they don&#8217;t say anything about it at WWDC.Apple is also giving AT&amp;T a nice little present in the form of the iPad. While the version hitting stores this Saturday will not have 3G connectivity, the one coming at the end of April will. And yes, it will be exclusively provided by AT&amp;T. There was some speculation leading up to the iPad launch that it may launch with Verizon connectivity, but the chances of Apple building a second CDMA version of the iPad anytime soon seem pretty slim at this point. Especially with AT&amp;T giving them an unheard deal for customers: $15 for 250MB-a-month of data usage and $30 for unlimited data. As anyone with a 3G card will tell you, this is basically half-off of the normal data rates the carriers charge.Apple is not stupid. They hear all of us bitching about AT&amp;T&#8217;s sub-par service, and word is that they&#8217;re not too happy about it either. But the fact of the matter is that because of the exclusive agreement, AT&amp;T is paying them a ridiculous fee for each iPhone solid â\\x80\\x94 something to the tune of $600 a phone. At the end of the day, that equals billions of dollars in revenues for Apple. If Apple were to branch out to other carriers, this deal would likely have to be renegotiated because Verizon has some leverage as the nation&#8217;s largest carrier and probably won&#8217;t give Apple the same kind of deal.So despite all of our bitching, Apple is only likely to move beyond exclusivity if it makes sense for the bottom line. That is, if Apple feels like the iPhone can&#8217;t grow any further in the U.S. under one carrier, they will extend it to others. Or, if Apple feels that Android is gaining too much momentum because it&#8217;s on several carriers, they will extend it to others. The latter appears to be starting to happen, while the former is still unclear. At one point, it was believed that Apple would wait out going to multiple carriers in the U.S. until the 4G networks (which will be a much more unified technology) were ready. But as the WSJ article states, delays in that process may have forced them to change their minds.So perhaps Apple is dangling the iPad and early access to the iPhone HD as signs of good faith towards AT&amp;T. Maybe they want the carrier to know that even though the time of exclusivity is coming to an end, they intend to give them certain perks in exchange for keeping the same terms of their current deal.Imagine for a second that the iPhone is available on AT&amp;T and Verizon â\\x80\\x94 but AT&amp;T gets access to the new hardware several months before Verizon. You might think most people would wait to buy the new iPhone, believing Verizon is the better network. But going forward, once Apple initially offloads a few million customers over to Verizon (which I don&#8217;t think is an unreasonable number for how many current iPhone owners would switch if given the option), some of AT&amp;T&#8217;s horrific networks problems (which are related the the network being under too much strain) may be miraculously solved.It seems like a win-win for everybody. Or at least Apple will paint it that way. And, as usual, they will be the real winner in the end.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the last few months we&#8217;ve seen quite a few international startups that are looking to capitalize on the success of Groupon, the deal-a-day startup that has been getting quite a bit of buzz lately. Europe has already seen many similar sites, and tonight, Brazil is getting its due: Peixe Urbano (which means &#8220;Urban Fish&#8221; in Portuguese) has just launched to the public, offering daily deals to Brazil&#8217;s nearly 70 million Internet users.Founder Julio Vasconcellos concedes that Peixe Urbano has many similarities to Groupon â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it sends users one great deal per day (generally offering 50-90% off) via Email, Twitter, or Facebook.  And, like Groupon, a certain number of people have to sign up for the deal before it &#8220;activates&#8221;, which gives users an incentive to tell their friends.  But Vasconcellos says that he and co-founder Alex Tabor have made some key changes to better adapt the new site to Brazilian culture.While both founders are from Brazil, they decided to do some market research to get a more accurate measure of how they should diverge fromÂ\\xa0Groupon&#8217;s model. Their conclusions: first, Vasconcellos says that Brazilians tend to favor spontaneous activities as opposed to discounts or gift cards with a six month expiration, so Peixe Urbano will include more time-sensitive deals, like cheap tickets for next-day shows or happy hour at the local restaurant. Second,Â\\xa0Vasconcellos says that Brazilians tend to be less excited about sharing coupons and sales with their friends (they may be frowned upon socially), so Peixe Urbano is positioning itself as a site to discover cool hidden gems in your city, with the added bonus of saving some money in the process.Other international Groupon-likeÂ\\xa0we&#8217;ve covered include Snippa(UK), Daily Deal(Germany), and CityDeal(Germany).  And there are plenty more â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0the UK alone has at least a half dozenÂ\\xa0GrouponÂ\\xa0clones.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'France Telecom / Orange is partnering with OpenX to launch Orange Ad Market, a brand new online advertising marketplace tailored to the European digital industry.Orange Ad Market will be operated by Orange and powered by OpenX in exchange for a share on every transaction that is made through the platform. The marketplace will allow all classes of buyers to compete for targeted impressions in real-time auctions and help sellers of online display advertising inventory from all over the globe maximize revenue. The partnership between Orange and OpenX spans multiple years and is mutually exclusive to all regions Orange operates in. Here&#8217;s how it will work:On the sell side, publishers make inventory available to Orange Ad Market. They set the minimum price on said inventory, which is basically the minimum they are willing to sell the ad space for, and they get to set filters on ad types and content. On the purchase side, ad buyers create campaigns targeting the inventory they desire. They can specify a variety of bid rules, including geo-targeting, category targeting, retargeting, brand safe restrictions, frequency capping, and more. They also specify the bid they wish to make for the desired inventory. Buyers can also use real-time bidding technology to bid at the instant the ad request comes into the Ad Market. As each ad request is made, Orange Ad Market holds an auction in real-time for that particular ad, with the impression going to the winning bidder if &#8211; and only if &#8211; it beats the minimum price set by the publisher.Initially, Orange Ad Market will be launched in the United Kingdom and France (expect its debut in the second quarter of 2010), with planned launches in other regions throughout Europe at an undefined later stage.The partnership is significant because Orange, unbeknownst to some, operates Europe&#8217;s largest advertising network: the Orange Ad Network is good for a global reach of approximately 343 million unique users per month, spread across no less than 33 countries. In the pilot countries for Orange Ad Market &#8211; the UK and France &#8211; alone, the network reaches some 75 million unique users on a monthly basis, according to Vincent Pelillo, Director of Orange Advertising Network.Basically, this means the France Telecom Group company can build upon a lot of existing relationships with both publishers and advertisers, and make a serious attempt at establishing a genuine pan-European ad exchange ecosystem.OpenX, which will deliver the technology platform and second-tier support for the venture, will collect a 20% fee on all transactions. OpenX&#8217;s CEO, former Yahoo exec Tim Cadogan, tells me this is the standard share it charges for transactions on its own OpenX Market, which he claims reaches more than quarter of a billion unique users per month, as well. Cadogan added that the company&#8217;s is actively looking to strike similar deals with carriers and other potential partners in the Americas and Asia.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Back in fall 2008, when the App Store was less than 100 days old, I wrote about an incredibly trippy and innovative application called RjDj (iTunes link). The app is a bit hard to describe, but it essentially takes audio or motion input from your iPhone, passes it through a variety of filters, and outputs music that&#8217;s customized to your surroundings (you really need to try it for yourself to see what it&#8217;s like).  Now, RjDj is taking its application to the next level: the company has released a new desktop app called RJC1000 that allows Mac users to easily build their own reactive music for use on any of RjDj&#8217;s growing roster of applications.To take a step back, when you use RjDj, you listen to what&#8217;s called a &#8220;Scene&#8221; â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0a combination of filters that determine what your reactive music sounds like. A Scene can pay attention to your iPhone&#8217;s microphone, accelerometer (so it can &#8216;hear&#8217; motion), and even your GPS position.  It then interprets those inputs to generate a dynamic music soundtrack.  Scenes can vary a lot, ranging from pleasant rain drops to psychedelic audio warping that loops back everything you hear endlessly. With the RJC1000 app, you can customize Scenes to make them sound exactly like you want them to.  You can get a feel for how this works in the YouTube video below.I explored the RJC1000 app to try building my own sound Scene, and quickly came to the conclusion that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Fortunately that didn&#8217;t really matter â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0after dragging a few effects from the list of options onto the main sound board, I found myself listening to something best described as an auditory mix of running water, crickets, bongo drums, and a swarm of butterflies. I&#8217;m sure someone with more patience and skill could come up with something significantly more pleasant.Alongside the new application, RjDj is launching theÂ\\xa0RjDj Network, whichÂ\\xa0allows reactive musicians (this genre is called &#8220;reactive music&#8221;) to sell their creations to anyone using the RjDj iPhone application, via in-app purchases.  RjDj is taking a 50% rev share of any Scenes sold. The company will also be launching an iPad application on April 3 called RJ Voyager that allows for playback of any Scenes from the RjDj Network, and also let users tweak Scenes on the fly, editing the effects they want playing as their music is generated in real-time.RjDj founder Michael Breidenbruecker says that developers and musicians have previously been able to create their own Scenes using Pure Data, but that most of them found it too abstract to use (the screenshots I looked at were pretty daunting). The RJC1000 application uses the Pure Data DSP framework, but makes it significantly easier to build a Scene. Â\\xa0He says that beyond the iPad app, RjDj has other applications in the works that will support Scenes from the RjDj network.    CrunchBase Information',\n",

All the initial hair-pulling and angst surrounding Apple&#8217;s decision to not support Flash on the iPad is already mattering less and less.  At least for video, most of the major online video platforms such as Brightcove and Ooyala are supporting HTML5 playback in the iPad browser.  YouTube might eventually get there as well.Now Kyte is jumping on the HTML5 bandwagon.  Kyte videos will stream in an HTML5 player in the iPad browser using the same embed code that triggers a Flash player on other computers.  But Kyte is also going to release a software developer kit (SDK) in the next couple weeks which will let its media partners create apps specifically for the iPad.  The SDK will also let them create versions of the same apps for the iPhone and the iPod Touch.  This will replace the iPhone framework Kyte released last year.The SDK will customize apps for the larger screen of the iPad, allowing for a larger video player and more room for chat and show guides.  In the mockup above from Om Records, you can see how there is more room for the various elements of the app on the iPad.Kyte&#8217;s main customers are media brands, music bands, and brands such as ABC, Fox News, MTV, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, and Calvin Klein who want to publish videos to their Websites and mobile apps all from the same system.  Kyte&#8217;s new Apple &#8220;universal&#8221; SDK will allow developers to create apps for both the iPhone and the iPad, and send out the correct version depending in the user&#8217;s device.

This store allows developers to get in touch with the geodata providers who are serving up the data (names you know like Twitter, Foursquare, Gowalla, etc).The Storage Engine is a cloud-based system to allow developers to store location and do queries on it. Think of it as Amazon S3 for geodata.So how much does it cost to use SimpleGeo? It&#8217;s free for up to a million calls, after that it&#8217;s $399 for 2 million calls (and additional support), $2,499 for 10 million calls, and $9,999 for 30 million calls. The pricing model is based on how much you&#8217;d need to pay for an engineer to handle that much data. Seeing as SimpleGeo curates this data and provides the servers needed for it, it will be a big value to most companies.DeCarta, ESRI, Localeze, MetaCarta, Quova, Stamen Design, and Weather Decision Technologies are a few of the big partnerships SimpleGeo recently signed. There was also a Skyhook Wireless deal that went live during SXSW. And you&#8217;ve probably heard of some of the startups already using SimpleGeo, such as StickyBits and BumpRadar.Since its $1.5 million seed funding in November, SimpleGeo has been hiring like crazy and hopes to open a San Francisco branch soon (they&#8217;re currently based in Boulder, CO).And despite the launch, SimpleGeo&#8217;s work is far from done. The plan is to launch a couple new features in relative short order, co-founder Matt Galligan tells us. One is called &#8220;Pushpin&#8221; which will let developers send in a coordinate and get back all sorts of data from SimpleGeo such as country, state, city, neighborhood, zip code, etc. And using other data, you could get the names of buildings on college campuses, for example, Galligan says.Another new feature called &#8220;Polygon&#8221; will let developers send in the name of an area such as &#8220;The Mission&#8221; in San Francisco, and SimpleGeo will return a list of everything in that area.Look for SimpleGeo&#8217;s new website and new admin interface to launch tomorrow after Galligan takes at Where 2.0 around noon PT. You&#8217;ll be able to sign up to get in on the location action at that time. Then you can go build your own version of this.[photo: flickr/bruce tuten]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the past few months, Automattic&#8217;s popular blog platform WordPress.com has taken an in-depth look at their blogging ecosystem, and realized that one of the major pain points for the 12.1 million users who self-host their WordPress blogs is security and restoration. WordPress.com backs up all of the blogs that it hosts, but those users who self-host their WordPress-powered blogs need to download outside plugins, such as this one, or use backup services like Mozy or Backupify to protect their data and content. Today Automattic is changing that with the launch of its own blog protection and restoration service for self-hosted blogs, called VaultPress. Currently in private beta, VaultPress is a plugin users can download that acts as a backup service for your blog. Not only will the software help keep your blog up and running, but it will also soon monitor your site to alert you if their is suspicious activity or a hacking. Alternatively, VaultPress will eventually update your blog with security hot-fixes automatically. VaultPress will be a paid service and will probably be in the ballpark range of $15 to 20 per month, according to Automattic VP of User Growth Paul Kim. At first VaultPress will be extended on an invitation only basis and will eventually be open to the public in the near future. While users can still use outside services or WordPress community plugins, VaultPress will be the only WordPress.com branded offering. And the plugin is tightly woven into WordPress.com infrastructure, promising greater operability, says Kim. Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg  says VaultPress is one of the most advanced technologies that he&#8217;s seen interact with WordPress. The vision of the service is to ensure that every piece of content on WordPress-powered blogs and sites are safe, with WordPress-aware, real-time, multi-cloud backups. VaultPress as a product makes sense for WordPress.com and frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that the blogging platform didn&#8217;t roll this out earlier.

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier today, Adobe and Google announced a partnership that integrates Flash right into future builds of Chrome. At a time when Flash is under fire from both Apple and HTML5 advocates, this is a huge win for the technology. But one thing that wasn&#8217;t clear from Google&#8217;s post on the matter (and Adobe&#8217;s comment to us) is what this means for the upcoming Chrome OS. So I asked.&#8220;We plan to bring these benefits to Chrome users across all platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Google Chrome OS,&#8221; a Google spokesperson tells me. In other words, yes, this deep Flash is coming to Chrome OS.Here&#8217;s why this is significant: when Chrome OS-based netbooks launch later this year they will not only compete with Windows-based netbooks, they will also compete with the iPad. The iPad, of course, will not run Flash. This could be a major differentiating factor when people are deciding which machine to buy this holiday season. Especially if those people are addicted to Farmville (which is, of course, Flash-based).â\\x80\\x9cNetbooks arenâ\\x80\\x99t better at anything,&#8221; Apple CEO Steve Jobs said while unveiling the iPad back in January.

       "  'comments_content': 'Imagine if you walked into a used car dealership and knew exactly how much the dealer was skimming off your purchase. I don&#8217;t want to draw a parallel between used car sales and the mobile ad marketplace, but it&#8217;s an industry, like many, that could use more transparency. Burstly, an ad manager service, wants to do just that.The company, a reincarnation of .App/Ads,Â\\xa0 just raised $1.8 million in series A funding from GRP Partners (Mark Suster is a partner) and Rincon Ventures. That values the start-up in the eight-figure range, according to CEO and founder Evan Rifkin. Burstly emerges from closed beta today and offers a full service, open platform (an open SDK structure) to help iPod touch and iPhone app developers optimize their advertising revenue streams,Â\\xa0 use a variety of ad networks or exchanges, directly sell or buy ads from other developers, run in-app purchases, rotate different content into ad slots and more.Â\\xa0 In addition, Burstly can support any ad size on the iPad and video interstitials.As of now everything is free except for the Burstly marketplace, where developers can buy or sell ad space with the community on a pay per install basis&#8212; all prices are transparent and Burstly collects a uniform 10% cut from each transaction. They&#8217;re so confident in the business model, that Burstly will give developers a no risk guarantee: the publisher submits a floor eCPM and Burstly will run impressions and try to beat that&#8212; if they can&#8217;t do that they&#8217;ll pay double the difference at the end of each month.The key to the company&#8217;s future profitability is of course volume. Rifkin knows that a 10% margin is pretty thin, but he&#8217;s hoping that the suite of services, simple interface, and clear economics will attract enough users to put the company in the black. With just 100 private beta users on the site (including Inedible Software, Boy Genius Report), he acknowledges that it may take 1.5 to 2 years. In fact, the company knows it may lose some money from its money back guarantee.Â\\xa0 Clearly, profits will require patience, but Burstly is well situated to be an important player in mobile advertising out of the gate&#8212; especially for small developers.Burstly is trying to set itself apart from competitors like AdMob and Quattro (both of which were recently acquired by giants&#8212; Google and Apple respectively), by focusing on a highly customizable ad management platform. A developer can add several SDKs and fine tune those options. For example, you can set it up so that a customer will only see Admob&#8217;s ads three times within a 24-hour period, after that limit is reached, new content from other sources like a different ad network, in-app purchase button,Â\\xa0 or Twitter/RSS feed could fill that space.Â\\xa0 The combination of new customizable services and the marketplace feature could be incredibly beneficial for small developers, who are not delivering tens of millions of impressions a day but are eager to maximize their ad mix. According to Rifkin, Burstly is not aiming to replace the mega ad networks, but let&#8217;s be honest, as Burstly&#8217;s marketplace grows (if, of course it can gain real traction)Â\\xa0 more and more developers will devote a higher percentage of their inventory to Burstly&#8217;s marketplace.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There&#8217;s a lot of excitement about Twitter&#8217;s first conference, Chirp, which takes place next month in San Francisco. In fact, the tickets for the event, despite their $469 price, have been selling out quickly (they&#8217;ve been releasing them in waves). And today brings great news for those still clamoring to go: there is a new type of ticket, and they&#8217;re significantly cheaper.Today, Twitter is putting on sale tickets for the second day of the conference for only $140 (yes, 140, like Twitter&#8217;s character limit). To be clear, this is just for the second day of the conference, but for those on a budget, it&#8217;s a much better deal to be able to take part in the event. The second day is the hack-a-thon event taking place at Fort Mason in the city. And it actually begins at 7 PM PT at the end of day one of the event, when Twitter buses people over from the Palace of Fine Arts, where the day one events (including the major keynotes from Twitter execs) take place.(If you want to catch those day one keynotes, you better hurry, Twitter only has about 200 of those tickets left.)Those who buy these $140 day two tickets will have access to the Ignite event, the breakout sessions, the hack event, and the party which will take place at the end of day two.And, not to be upstaged by Facebook, which is offering student tickets to its f8 event (which is exactly one week later in San Francisco) at $75, Twitter is unleashing tickets for students to both days of the event for just $50. To get these heavily discounted tickets, student will need to bring a valid student ID.Much was made early on about the price of Twitter&#8217;s conference as compared to the rival f8 event, but actually, f8 is $425 this year (up from even the $325 we initially thought it would be). So Twitter&#8217;s conference is just $44 more, and that&#8217;s despite no outside partners (which the Facebook event has).Chirp is being produced by Carsonified, the group behind the popular FOWA events. It runs April 14 and 15 in San Francisco.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Twitter has just rolled out a new homepage that&#8217;s a marked improvement over the current offering, and does a much better job at capturing what the service is all about.  The new site features a &#8216;See who&#8217;s here&#8217; section that introduces new Twitter users to some of the celebrities and brands they can find on the service.    It also includes a new, constantly updated section for Top Tweets, which are algorithmically selected interesting tweets (Top Tweets also has its own Twitter account here).Twitter&#8217;s homepage is important because it&#8217;s typically the first thing people see when they visit Twitter for the first time (once you&#8217;ve created an account and signed in, the service automatically directs you to your Twitter feed).  Twitter last refreshed its homepage last summer, when it started featuring its search engine front and center (you can see a screenshot of the old page below).  This introduced users to the site&#8217;s powerful real-time search, but it didn&#8217;t do a particularly good job explaining exactly what Twitter was.I suspect the new page will do a better job enticing new users to explore Twitter, as they&#8217;ll be more quickly exposed to interesting tweets (via the Top Tweets section) and will immediately see a smattering of the major brands and celebrities using the service. And they&#8217;ll have something to look at other than tweets talking about Justin Bieber.Note that the page only appears to be showing up sometimes (I just reloaded and no longer see it).Update: Twitter has just posted a blog post talking about the change.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:All of our recent changes embrace the notion that Twitter is not just for status updates anymore. It&#8217;s a network where information is exchanged and consumed at a rapid clip every second of the day. With so much being shared, we know that there&#8217;s something of value for everyone. People who internalize the value of Twitter understand the power of this simple medium.

       "  'comments_content': 'There may be a simpler explanation behind the increased blockage of Google search results in mainland China today than a deliberate government crackdown.  It seems that the Great Firewall of China which automatically filters out a long list of objectionable material on the Web from ever entering China is mistaking Google for Radio Free Asia, one of the sites blocked by China.According to a Google spokesperson who just got back to me, this seems to be what is happening:Lots of users in China have been unable to search on Google.com.hk today. This blockage seems to have been triggered by a change on Google&#8217;s part. In the last 24 hours &#8220;gs_rfai&#8221; started appearing in the URLs of Google searches globally as part of a search parameter, a string of characters that sends information about the query to Google so we can return the best result. Because this parameter contained the letters rfa the great firewall was associating these searches with Radio Free Asia, a service that has been inaccessible in China for a long time&#8211;hence the blockage. We are currently looking at how to resolve this issue.If this theory is correct, any URL that includes the letters &#8220;rfa&#8221; in a row could also be blocked.  It is not clear why the Great Firewall cannot figure out the difference between the rfa.org URL and a string of letters that happens to include the same letters (without the .org).  Another theory: China knows exactly what it is doing and it is just messing with Google.Update 2:  On second thought, even Google is not so sure that its Radio Free Asia theory holds any water.  Another Google spokesperson just sent me the following update:Having looked into this issue in more detail, it&#8217;s clear we actually added this parameter a week ago. So whatever happened today to block Google.com.hk must have been as a result of the change in the great firewall. However, interestingly our search traffic in China is now back to normalâ\\x80\\x94even though we have not made any changes at our end. We will continue to monitor what is going on, but for the time being this issue seems to be resolved.Yup, China is just messing with them.Image credit: Flickr/The Humanaught.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Startup Buddy Media, a company that provides social media management tools to brands, has raised $2 million in funding from previous investors including SoftBank Capital, Greycroft Partners, Ron Conway, and Bay Partners. Buddy Media previously raised $8 million in funding. Buddy Media offers brand marketers and agencies and all-in-one social media management system to help create, manage and track social campaigns on Facebook and Twitter (the client will also offers functionality for MySpace and other social networks). With regard to Facebook, the platform lets agencies create, manage and track Facebook Fan pages to drive and increase user and brand engagement. Users donâ\\x80\\x99t need to have any prior FBML knowledge to create pages on Facebook and can create sleek and interactive pages fairly easily. Buddy Mediaâ\\x80\\x99s Twitter Management System, which we wrote about here, lets marketers measure and identify Twitter trending topics around a particular brand, related topics and competitors. You can also track performance and trends for a brand and entire industry across Twitter with easy to view data on followers, mentions, and re-Tweets.As brands are flocking to Facebook to connect with the social network&#8217;s 400 million plus users, Buddy Media&#8217;s offerings come in handy. In fact, the startup is was profitable at the end of 2009, and is on track to make $20 million in sales this year. And well-known brands and organizations are using Buddy Media&#8217;s platform including Budweiser, NBC&#8217;s iVillage, designer Tory Burch, the NHL and the Dallas Cowboys. The platform finished 2009 with 150 clients, and has already added 45 more in 2010 alone. Buddy Media&#8217;s CEO and founder Michael Lazerow tells me that the startup is adding around 20 clients per month. And Lazerow says that the company needs more staff and talent to manage this rapid influx of clients. The new funding will be primarily used to hire developers and sales professionals. Buddy Media&#8217;s platform is attractive because it lets marketers and advertisers with little to no technical knowledge create and manage attractive, branded Facebook fan pages, Twitter profiles and more. Of course, Buddy Media has a few competitors in the field including Involver and CoTweet (which was just acquired by ExactTarget ). \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

And once the profile is up there&#8217;s no taking it down.I asked co-founder, Peter Kazanjy, &#8220;Will you ever give users the option to take down their profile?&#8221; Kazanjy&#8217;s reply: &#8220;No, because if we did that, everyone would take their profile down&#8221; (see our video with Kazanjy after the break). Thus Unvarnished is a service that depends (and ultimately profits) on digital paranoia and our growing anxiety when it comes to our online identity. Doesn&#8217;t give you the warm fuzzies but (as Mike Arrington points out in &#8220;Reputation is Dead&#8221;) it is perhaps a logical evolution of social media. The site&#8217;s fundamental concept is not new (ikarma.com, Jerk.com) but Unvarnished has the best interface to attract a large community of professionals. Here&#8217;s the good, the bad and the truly ugly:For now, the site is invite-only beta. You can either join the nebulous waiting list or you can wait for a private alpha user (a group of roughly 1,000) to request a review from you via Facebook. Once you connect and submit a post your account is active and you are free to claim your profile, create a new profile, invite users and submit as many anonymous reviews as your little heart desires. There are roughly 400,000 profiles in the database with the vast majority from Silicon Valley.Unvarnished argues that there are lots of tools to actively manage your reputation (like updates, ability to comment and request new reviews)Â\\xa0 but it omits the most important tool of all: the ability to strike down really damaging posts. Of course, empowering the user in that way would render the site toothless (a LinkedIn 2.0) because no sane person would keep a negative or even lukewarm review on their profile. But as I&#8217;ve said, the alternative is really scary.Let&#8217;s look at the few, real safeguards on Unvarnished: if a user has a dummy Facebook account (recently opened, no friends) and writes a negative review that post is automatically blocked. In addition, the community votes on how helpful a review is and positive ratings improve the trustworthy rank of the reviewer&#8212; a modest incentive to be fair. The truly vile and illegal trash&#8211; like false allegations of homicide&#8211; will be flagged and immediately removed.But let&#8217;s remember: there&#8217;s a wide spectrum between downright illegal and ambiguously negative. You could raise serious doubts about a person&#8217;s ethics and competency without proof and &#8212; let&#8217;s be honest here&#8212; without even believing your fabrications. This could be the place to anonymously settle vendettas: co-worker swipes a promotion, go to Unvarnished, boss dishes out a small bonus, go to Unvarnished, the vice president makes an ambiguous pass at your girlfriend, go to Unvarnished&#8230;you get the idea. Kazanjy says the goal of Unvarnished is to bring accountability and transparency to the workplace, which it will certainly do to some extent. But it will also become a nicely indexed, digital burn book. And we all know how that ends:Theoretically, a community of professionals has more scruples and ethics than a group of 17-year-olds (maybe), but my guess is that many will be seduced by the dark powers of the internet (the power to hammer an adversary under the guise of anonymity). Kazanjy says all those negative opinions/rumors are already out there, lurking in blog posts and comments. His site, Kazanjy says, merely condenses, organizes, and helps you refute those claims. I disagree, I think it encourages defamation by ensuring a forum. If you guarantee a microphone, there&#8217;s an extra incentive for a malicious co-worker to go out of their way to post a rumor&#8212; because they know it will directly affect your reputation. Obviously, the repercussions could be huge. A damaging review could severely jeopardize a user&#8217;s present and future employment. Because humans magnify the negative; an employee with 50 extremely positive reviews and 5 very negative reviews would be at a disadvantage against someone with no Unvarnished profile. Let&#8217;s look at one account with negative reviews:',\n",

UK firm Coda Research Consultancy forecasts that in the U.S. alone mobile handset data traffic will grow from 8 petabytes/month this year to 327 petabytes/month in 2015.  That amounts to a 117 percent compound annual growth rate.A lot of that data will come in the form of mobile Web browsing, with the biggest contributor expected to be mobile video.  By 2015, mobile video will account for 68.5 percent of all mobile data  usage in the U.S. (or 224 petabytes/month).  Coda estimates that 95 million mobile handset subscribers in the U.S. will be watching video on their phones in five years out of a total of 158 million mobile internet users.Mobile data revenues (not including SMS charges) are forecast to make up 87 percent of all data revenue for the carriers by 2015.  But they will have a hard time keeping up with demand unless they adopt tiered pricing, predicts Coda co-founder Steve Smith.  Consumers used to all-you-can-eat data access from their phones will find that unappealing.  But carriers will have to figure out a way to pay for massive network upgrades.  Coda estimates that if the carrier&#8217;s froze their networks today, they would reach 100 percent utilization at peak capacity by 2012, when 40 percent of phones will be smartphones.The table below shows some more forecasts from Coda on the number of U.S. mobile Internet users and the percentage of mobile data traffic coming from smartphones versus feature phones:&nbsp;201020112012201320142015Mobile Internet users via handsets84M100M113M128M145M158MSmartphone traffic as % of handset traffic79%90%95%97%98%98%Feature phone traffic as % of handset traffic21%10%5%3%2%2%CrunchBase Information',\n",

Concretely, Adobe has announced that its Flash Player will be included with future versions of Google Chrome right out the gate, so users will soon no longer be required to download and install a third-party plugin to make it work with the open source browser built on top of Chromium. Furthermore, updates to Flash Player will be delivered directly via Google Chrome&#8217;s updating system, ultimately minimizing security risks that tend to surface when using outdated software and components. You can download the dev channel build now, and yes, you can easily disable the built-in Flash Player if you like.In addition, Adobe says it is working with Mozilla and Google and the &#8220;broader community&#8221; to create a new API for browser plugins. This new API, which will build off Mozilla&#8217;s NPAPI, which has been designed from the start to be both operating system and browser neutral. In essence, the goal of the new API is to allow plugins to more tightly integrate with host browsers, which in turn should benefit users in terms of performance and security.The new browser plugin API will allow add-ons to directly share more information about its current state to its developers and the makers of the host browser it was made for, and it could also allow for a more secure browsing experience as the process of unifying security models and collaboration on techniques to defend against hackers (e.g. sandboxing) will be made easier. Indeed, Chrome&#8217;s â\\x80\\x9csandboxâ\\x80\\x9d has already been extended to Web pages with Flash content.From the Chromium blog:Improving the traditional browser plug-in model will make it possible for plug-ins to be just as fast, stable, and secure as the browserâ\\x80\\x99s HTML and JavaScript engines. Over time this will enable HTML, Flash, and other plug-ins to be used together more seamlessly in rendering and scripting.You can read the respective announcements regarding the partnership directly from Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player team and on the Chromium blog.I inquired about plans to integrate Flash Player with Google Chrome OS too, but was unsurprisingly told that there are no announcements to be made right now.

       "  'comments_content': 'This morning, over two dozen major tech companies, civil rights organizations, lawyers, and privacy advocates banded together to launch Digital Due Process, a coalition that is focused on helping modernize digital privacy laws.  Specifically, the coalition is looking to revamp the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which defines the laws that govern online privacy and how law enforcement can retrieve information from online service providers. ECPA was approved in 1986, when the Internet was in its infancy, and the coalition contends that it has become confusing and doesn&#8217;t include enough safeguards to protect user data.  Among the coalition&#8217;s members are AOL, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Salesforce, Loopt, AT&amp;T, the ACLU, and the EFF.Here are the four core principles on the DDP website:A governmental entity may require an entity covered by ECPA (a provider of wire or electronic communication service or a provider of remote computing service) to disclose communications that are not readily accessible to the public only with a search warrant issued based on a showing of probable cause, regardless of the age of the communications, the means or status of their storage or the providerâ\\x80\\x99s access to or use of the communications in its normal business operations.A governmental entity may access, or may require a covered entity to provide, prospectively or retrospectively, location information regarding a mobile communications device only with a warrant issued based on a showing of probable cause.A governmental entity may access, or may require a covered entity to provide, prospectively or in real time, dialed number information, email to and from information or other data currently covered by the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices only after judicial review and a court finding that the governmental entity has made a showing at least as strong as the showing under 2703(d).Where the Stored Communications Act authorizes a subpoena to acquire information, a governmental entity may use such subpoenas only for information related to a specified account(s) or individual(s). All non-particularized requests must be subject to judicial approval.Google has written a blog post outlining the same principles (the wording is a bit easier to understand). Google has also produced the video below to explain the issue.Better protect your data stored online: The government must first get a search warrant before obtaining any private communications or documents stored online;Better protect your location privacy: The government must first get a search warrant before it can track the location of your cell phone or other mobile communications device;Better protect against monitoring of when and with whom you communicate: The government must demonstrate to a court that the data it seeks is relevant and material to a criminal investigation before monitoring when and with whom you communicate using email, instant messaging, text messaging, the telephone, etc.; andBetter protect against bulk data requests: The government must demonstrate to a court that the information it seeks is needed for a criminal investigation before it can obtain data about an entire class of users.',\n",

For now, statistics are limited to Apple&#8217;s App Store and Android Market, but from what I can gather the service will soon be extended to include tailored reports for BlackBerry App World, Nokia Ovi Store, Palm App Catalog and Windows Marketplace for Mobile, as well as mobile operator and independent stores such as Verizon VCast and GetJar. What I like about the tool is that it allows developers to not only track their own applications but also gain some insights into how well they stack up against their competitors, regardless of which country they target.

China&#8217;s firewall is mistaking it for Radio Free Asia.When Google shut down its Chinese search operations and moved them to Hong Kong, it placed its search results outside the so-called Great Chinese Firewall.  China immediately started blocking politically sensitive search queries, just as it does for all Web content outside the firewall.  That was a week ago.  But reports are coming out of China today that censors are turning up the heat on Google, and &#8220;searches on any topic delivered an error message,&#8221; according to the Telegraph One blogger in China says all searches on Google return the &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; and result in a connection reset.  Although some Tweets from inside China say they have no problems with Google being blocked.  Google&#8217;s Mainland China availability page has yet to be updated today and showed no issues with Web search as of yesterday.  However, Google&#8217;s mobile sites started to be partially blocked three days ago.  Gmail is still working.Whether China is moving to completely block Google or it is just tweaking its settings on the Great Firewall, the Chinese government is likely to continue its efforts to clamp down on access to Google.  Chinese media are not allowed to veer from the Party line when discussing the issue.  But blocking Google entirely also serves as a stark reminder to China&#8217;s people that the Great Firewall exists and there is a whole other world of information on the Web their censors don&#8217;t want them to see.Image credit: Flickr/The Humanaught.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The company is one of the most widely used ad platforms and counts NPR, CNN and Fox as clients. Today, the advertising platform is announcing a Universal SDK for iPhone and iPad, allowing publishers and developers to seamlessly switch between ad networks and first-party ad servers.  The Medialets Universal SDK for iPhone and iPad  will allows publishers to modify and change their ad tags from various networks without having to update their app. The new SDK works with any first or third party ad sever, network or mediator, including AdMob  and Quattro Wireless tags. Medialets promises rich media and display advertising on mobile phones that provides deeper engagement with users. In fact, engagement is a primary measurement that the ad platform focuses on when determining the success of its advertising campaigns. Medialets says its app engagement see between 3.5 and 7 minutes of average usage per app usage session. But developers and advertisers may be more beholden to click-through rates, which Medialets claim are between 1 and 8 percent. But eight percent seems a bit high, considering that other rich media mobile ad platforms, including Greystripe and AdMob, are seeing between 1 and 2 percent. The universal SDK is definitely an attractive feature for developers who may not want to waste time in switching in SDKs for different networks (Mobclix allows you to do this within its platform). And I imagine that other mobile ad networks will develop their own universal SDKs in due time. Medialets has raised $4 million in Series A funding last spring and plans to launch a universal SDK for Android in the next month. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Yesterday, we heard that Brightcove will stream video in an HTML5 video player as opposed to a Flash unit. And today, Greystripe is announcing that it will be bringing its rich media iFlash ad units to the iPad in May. Greystripe has been allowing advertisers to use Flash-like technologies in their iPhone advertisements for some time now. The network essentially takes ads created using Flash and transcodes them to run on the iPhone and now the iPad. The technology changes the nature of the Flash ads on the front end but the rich media ad behaves the same way.  Greystripe claims that its &#8220;iFlash&#8221; ads see higher clickthrough rates than even online campaigns, with average CTRs above 1%. And Greystripe says that its mobile iFlash ads increase awareness of a brand and intent to purchase, watch or recommend a particular brand. Brands using Greystripe&#8217;s mobile ads include HP, Burger King, Axe, Dunlop and LeapFrog.But the real question is if advertisers see better CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) with Greystripe&#8217;s ads than its competitors, such as AdMob or Quattro Wireless. To our knowledge, Greystripe&#8217;s CPMs fall into the same range as AdMob&#8217;s. But Greystripe has continued to make its rich media ad offerings more appealing and attractive to both developers and advertisers by extending support to various devices and even launching a guaranteed CPM program. The company also partnered with Tribal Fusion to enable online ads to fit on iPhones seamlessly. It&#8217;s unclear how Google&#8217;s acquisition of AdMob and Apple&#8217;s acquisition of Quattro Wireless will effect the other ad networks in the space.

Here&#8217;s how it works: real estate agents place signs or ads about a property for sale that prompt interested buyers to send a text message carrying a unique ID code and receive more information, pricing and optionally some photos of the property in response. The agent and potential buyer can then connect in a variety of ways to discuss the properties for sale.I suppose it&#8217;s a solution that can benefit real estate pros tremendously, but I&#8217;m seriously doubting if people are generally inclined to simply send a text message to an agent. The way I see it, there are enough ways for potential buyers to get in touch with sellers if they&#8217;re genuinely interested as it is. I also think QR codes or other types of barcodes that can transfer multimedia to mobile phones directly would be far more effective when placed on signs or ads.Your thoughts?

       "  'comments_content': '[Germany] Billed as an iPad competitor, the WePad is not vaporware, but is in fact, The Chosen One. At least, that&#8217;s the view of some, who are hailing the WePad as the saviour of the German print publishing industry. While Apple is still racing to the wire to secure enough media content partnerships for the iPad before its launch this week, the WePad has already bagged Europe&#8217;s biggest publisher, Gruner + Jahr.Bernd Buchholz, CEO of Gruner + Jahr, presented the first German-born slate PC at last week&#8217;s annual press conference for his company. Unfortunately, there is only a very dark photo of this event on Facebook (see above), but you can find new professional shots on sites like Areamobile (below).Axel Springer, publisher of Europe&#8217;s biggest newspaper BILD is also in talks to use the WePad, says the latest rumour quoted by German newswire DPA.But Buchholz must have jumped the gun, because the WePad&#8217;s creator Neofonie had scheduled all official announcements about the WePad&#8217;s hardware and media partnerships for April 12. That didn&#8217;t hold Buchholz back from presenting a WePad version of Stern, one of Germany&#8217;s biggest magazines which sells 900,000 copies. Other similar versions of Gruner + Jahr magazines like Geo or Gala are in the making. They will be marketed at similar prices like their print versions and the launch date is just some months away. Apart from the text and pictures of their print issues, the WePad versions will be full of audio, video and Flash and also interwoven with the magazines&#8217; websites.It seems that Gruner + Jahr is not the only publisher who believes in the WePad&#8217;s success. Neofonie CEO Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen is &#8220;happy about the first big advance orders from companies&#8221;, he wrote on the WePad Facebook site (5,709 fans). Gruner + Jahr has officially announced a plan to license the WePad&#8217;s epaper software, that Neofonie developed on their behalf, to other publishers. The WeMagazine publishing software is platform independent and apparently works with several devices or user interfaces, including the iPad and normal computers.The underlying strategy is clear: &#8220;We insist on our sovereignity of products and contents&#8221;, Buchholz said in his Thursday&#8217;s speech, clearly hinting at recent problems. Apple removed the Stern iPhone app in November without warning from the App Store due to objections over photo galleries featuring too much nakedness. The Association of German Magazine Publishers (VDZ) warned that such intrusions might represent a move towards censorship.German publishers are also disgruntled with Apple&#8217;s pricing policy. Buchholz said they need to &#8220;get in charge of pricing&#8221;. Apple&#8217;s regulations have the absurd side effect that an iPhone version of Germany&#8217;s most important news magazine, Der Spiegel, will cost more than the print version. Its price will soon jump to &#8364;3.99, after the &#8364;2.99 introductory offer is over, while the paper sells for &#8364;3.80. Therefore Gruner + Jahr appears to be at the helm of establishing a totally competing platform to the iPad. &#8220;We are in talks with nearly all big and small German publishers, also with [our big competitors] Springer and Burda&#8221;, Buchholz said in a press conference after his speech.Oddly, Gruner + Jahr has jumped the gun before the official April 12 event, and the WePad&#8217;s hardware spec is now getting out there. Gadget geeks have posted interesting links, such a possible WePad prototype running Windows. It also appears that the WePad will be made by OEM Pegatron, a company connected to the iPhone, ironically.So far Neofonie isn&#8217;t very helpful on what ebooks formats will be  supported. Its latest product sheet says again that the iPad uses a &#8220;proprietary Apple format for iBooks store&#8221; while, they claim, the WePad is better for supporting &#8220;all open formats, additionally premium formats&#8221;. This repeats their statement which was criticised after our latest TechCrunch post.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Push Notifications on the iPhone are great, but they can be impossible to manage. That&#8217;s why Boxcar, a Push Notification management app, is brilliant, and has long been one of my favorite apps. Unfortunately, as great as it is, like Apple itself, it is also a closed system. But now, it&#8217;s opening up.What I mean by closed system is that Boxcar only serves up notifications for a select few services, such as Twitter and Facebook. But with its new Provider feature (and API), anyone can tap into the Boxcar platform to enable Push Notifications through the service.This step has been in the works for a few months creator Jonathan George tells us. But it comes just weeks after a competitor, Notifo, started offering the same thing. However, unlike Notifo, Boxcar subscriptions and settings are easily managed from within the iPhone app itself, rather than having to visit a site to manage things.And there&#8217;s another potentially huge benefit.Beginning in Q2 2010, Boxcar is going to open up these provider notifications to be monetized. What this means is that third-parties can charge customers for the ability to get Push Notifications and Boxcar will share the revenue from the in-app purchase as a 50/50 split. It&#8217;s worth noting that this would work only for one-time purchases, and not for subscriptions. Still, this is potentially a nice way for third-parties to make some money without having to worry about building an maintaining their own Push Notification system.Unlike Notifo, Boxcar plans to review all services that want to use the providers feature to maintain some order. And, as Boxcar notes:There are two kinds of notifications &#8211; broadcast notifications, and individual notifications. Individual notifications are best used for action items, such as when a users comment is replied to. Broadcast notifications send the same message to every Boxcar user that has subscribed to your provider.While the service currently only works for the iPhone, the plan is to launch an Android app within the next 90 days. After that, Windows Mobile support should come along.But even without those other platforms, Boxcar is doing just fine. So far, the service has pushed over 100,000,000 Push Notifications to date.You can find Boxcar in the App Store here. It&#8217;s a free download. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A new take on the group-buying bandwagon launches today, but this one will attempt to address the information overload about offers, known as &#8220;voucher fatigue&#8221;, while incentivising local businesses. Keynoir is described as a &#8220;private buying club meets Woot&#8221;, in reference to the tech site which made its name by having just one offer on one decent product a day. The startup even includes aspects of the old Letsbuyit.com. But this is not a trivial play. Keynoir has already secured Â£1.3m of investment from PROFounders Capital, investor Jan Riem and Index Ventures (including Dominique Vidal). Serial entrepreneurs Paul Birch and Andrej Henkler participated. Vidal and Sean Seton-Rogers from PROfounders will be joining the board.The founders are Philip Wilkinson (founder of the UK&#8217;s first price comparison engine which later became Kelkoo), Glen Drury (ex-MD Kelkoo Europe and VP Yahoo), and Jan Riem (technology deal maker). It launches in London this week , and plans to exand across the rest of the UK and Europe by the end of the year.Here&#8217;s how it will work. Users will buy lifestyle experiences (such as hotels, restaurant bookings and spa days) and more &#8220;unusual and secret things&#8221; they say. There will be one such offer a day (called a Keypass) with a limited time window and limited quantity available, driving adoption. As with other group buying sites, a minimum number of people are required to confirm a purchase before the offer is unlocked to the rest of the member base. But the founders emphasise that since not everyone who arrives at the site will be accepted as a member, Keynoir will be very targetted.â\\x80\\x9cPeople are becoming increasing weary and cynical of the whole discount marketplace and are looking for something more fulfilling,&#8221; says Wilkinson. It&#8217;s targeting 23 â\\x80\\x93 35 year old professionals and is looking to have a strict selection process for deals across the travel, food, retail and entertainment sectors.His view is that that local businesses will like Keynoir since the business only pays if it gets enough people to buy on that day, thus filling capacity in the downturn without heavy advertising costs.Hoberman is equally enthusiastic. He calls it the start of a &#8220;a new generation of social buying which will effectively connect the offline and online worlds.â\\x80\\x9dMy view is that the walled garden approach is smart. In fact it&#8217;s already been tried by Wahanda, not through creating a barrier to entry before you can get in, but by targeting a niche. This is the one thing that most group buying sites have missed, thus leading to offer fatigue.However the model is of course replicable, so watch as other sites spring up to copy its approach.Especially for TechCrunch readers, this link will automatically get you around the invite selection process and let you create an account to see the first launch deal.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'My bad â\\x80\\x94 maybe.Earlier today, I reported that Google Buzz, Google&#8217;s new social sharing service, was sending less traffic than FriendFeed, a service which has been a ghost town in recent months. It turns out there&#8217;s probably a good explanation for this. You see, in January, Google started defaulting all Gmail traffic to the HTTPS (secure) version of its domain. Previously, it was defaulting to the regular HTTP (unsecure) domain. As a result of this change, all traffic referrers are scrubbed before being picked up by services like Google Analytics.I didn&#8217;t realize the change would cause such a scrubbing, but it makes sense. Google&#8217;s Matt Cutts pointed it out earlier (in Buzz, appropriately), and looking at our logs, it does, in fact, appear that in January (when the change was made) traffic from the mail.google.com domain plummeted. This was before Buzz ever existed.This is interesting because it means that Google Buzz is essentially a social service that you can&#8217;t track the effectiveness of for your own site. Of course, given that so much of Twitter is run through its API, measuring Twitter traffic by the twitter.com domain is also flawed.Still, looking over the overall numbers, it would seem that aside from a rise in referrals from the usual suspects (Twitter.com, Facebook.com, etc), we haven&#8217;t seen a huge bump from some unknown anomaly out there Â\\xa0â\\x80\\x94 which, you&#8217;d assume, would be Buzz. So I&#8217;m still not convinced that it&#8217;s actually sending a lot of traffic our way. But, admittedly, it&#8217;s hard to know for sure, because like a black hole, its existence must be inferred.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Back in fall 2008, we covered the launch ofÂ\\xa0Twilio, a service thatÂ\\xa0gives web developers an API to easily build web apps with telephony features, like audio playback, voice recording, and more recently, SMS messages. Now a new challenger is approaching: a service calledÂ\\xa0Teleku offers many of the same features, but it&#8217;s taking a different approach that its founder says makes it more flexible.  It&#8217;s cash-flow positive, and it was built by one man over the course of two months.  Teleku is in a private beta, but you can grab an account by going here and using the code &#8216;techcrunch&#8217; to sign up.So how does Teleku differ from Twilio?  It&#8217;s a matter of flexibility, according to founder (and sole employee) Chris Matthieu. He says that when you use Twilio, it&#8217;s an all-in-one deal: you write your code in Twilo&#8217;s easy-to-use syntax called TwiML, which is then sent to Twilio&#8217;s telephony services in the cloud that are hosted on AWS. That&#8217;s great (and may be even preferable to some people), but with Twilio you can&#8217;t port your application to a cheaper service should one become available.With Teleku, you can write your code using TwiML, or you can use Teleku&#8217;s own simplified telephony scripting language, called PhoneML.  Your code is then sent to Teleku&#8217;s servers, which translate it into industry standard (but harder to write) VoiceXML.  Matthieu says you can use that code on any of a variety of established telephony providers, including Voxeo and Plum Voice,  and it will also work with enterprise systems that rely on VoiceXML.Matthieu says this gives Teleku users a few advantages: first, they can swap between various providers if they find a better rate.  And he also says that Voxeo and other telecom services have better optimized their servers than AWS has to work with voice traffic, and that they offer a few features that Twilio doesn&#8217;t yet, like speech recognition.Finally, Teleku offers a wizard for building web-enabled telephony services for people who don&#8217;t have any coding experience at all.   This allows you to select actions from a dropdown menu, like &#8220;Play&#8221;, &#8220;Speak&#8221;, and &#8220;Transfer&#8221; (you then fill in text dialogs to instruct the application what to say or what number to transfer to).  You can drag and drop these actions depending on what order you&#8217;d like to execute each action.  Watch the video below for a complete demo of the wizard.Teleku is offering two pricing models: first, an &#8216;all-in-one&#8217; package similar to Twilio&#8217;s that uses Voxeo as to handle its telephony services.  This costs three cents a minute, which is the same as Twilio.  For users that want to use Teleku in combination with a provider other than Voxeo, Teleku doesn&#8217;t charge on a per-minute basis.  Instead, it adopts a web-service API model, charging on the number of calls rather than the call length.  Teleku is still a small operation, but Matthieu says he&#8217;s already had early acquisition talks with potentially interested buyers.All of that said, Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson contends that there are some tradeoffs that come with Teleku&#8217;s flexibility. He explains that applications ported to these other services won&#8217;t always translate properly (he says this is one of the benefits of using Twilio&#8217;s all-in-one model). He also says there are some features that Teleku doesn&#8217;t offer, like 2-way SMS. Â\\xa0But he saysÂ\\xa0Twilio isn&#8217;tÂ\\xa0necessarilyÂ\\xa0opposed to the concept of portability, and that Teleku validates Twilio&#8217;s easy-to-use approach to telephony scripting (he also notes that 37signals has started integrating Twilio into some of its products).Image credit: Sumo Web Works.

       "  'comments_content': 'As a professional social network, LinkedIn hasn&#8217;t ignored the mobile interests of its 60 million plus users. The company has consistently updated its sleek iPhone app, recently launching a new version. Last fall, LinkedIn announced that a powerful BlackBerry app would be on its way. And the app is an important connector to the enterprise crowd, which generally tend to use BlackBerry devices. Tonight, the new app officially launches. You can download the app here. The LinkedIn app for BlackBerry is as feature-rich as its iPhone cousin. You can visualize your feed of network updates, search across direct connections and the entire LinkedIn network, access any of your connections to get get profile information, and message contacts. You can also access your LinkedIn inbox, send and accept invitations and see all of your messages. And the app will suggest new connections to you. LinkedIn has been working with RIM to develop a native application that leverages the phone&#8217;s technologies. Users can integrate their LinkedIn connections with their devices&#8217; address book, and view the profile of any contact directly on a device. LinkedIn invitations and messages will show up in the BlackBerry device&#8217;s inbox. Users can also view the LinkedIn profile of the sender of any email they receive. And users can view the LinkedIn profile of an attendee of a meeting on their BlackBerry devices&#8217; calendar.There&#8217;s no doubt that the LinkedIn app for BlackBerry will be popular; especially considering the significant use of the device in professional environments. LinkedIn has been consistently upgrading its platform over the past few months, adding two-way integration with Twitter as well as opening up its API  to developers.  LinkedIn also recently unveiled a significant integration with Microsoft Outlook, allowing users to access parts of their LinkedIn accounts from Outlook. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In a post tinged with just a hint of spite, Apple pundit John Gruber has responded to today&#8217;s WSJ report of a forthcoming pair of new iPhones, one of which they say is headed for Verizon. His reaction? &#8220;Lame.&#8221;The reason it&#8217;s lame, says Gruber, is that it lacks details. Details which Gruber has. Maybe.Gruber lists a handful of specs, but does so in such a way that it&#8217;s not at all clear if he&#8217;s claiming the specs are the real deal or just the type of specs that would be expected from a real, non-&#8221;lame&#8221; scoop:And they have no actual details of the next-generation iPhone. Nothing. Not the A4-family CPU system-on-a-chip. Not the 960â\\x80\\x89Ã\\x97â\\x80\\x89640 double-resolution display. Not the second front-facing camera. Not even the third-party multitasking in iPhone OS 4. All they have is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a new iPhone this summer, period.There&#8217;s certainly nothing too crazy there. A4 CPU? Sure &#8212; Apple probably didn&#8217;t build that thing solely for the iPad. A 960&#215;640 display (with a resolution double quadruple that of the iPhone&#8217;s current 480&#215;320 display) would allow all apps to perfectly fill the screen in a 2x drawing mode, ensuring compatibility and eliminating a major fragmentation issue. A front-facing camera has been rumored since before even the first generation iPhone, and I&#8217;m pretty sure The New Kids On The Block were still huge when the multi-tasking rumor came around. Still, he never outright claims that these are indeed specs that have been leaked to him.He certainly implies it, though. In a response to a tweet saying &#8220;I love how @gruber &#8220;casually&#8221; slips all the iPhone inside info he has into a post criticizing the WSJ,&#8221; Gruber responds simply:&#8220;Not all.&#8221;Tricky, Gruber.

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: What does the iPad have to do with cloud computing?  Glad you asked. In this guest post Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of salesforce.com, explains how liberating the iPad will really be.The first piece of software I ever wrote was on the TRS-80 Model 1. It was called &#8220;How To Juggleâ\\x80\\x9d, and it had 4K of memory.  It was my version of â\\x80\\x9cHello Worldâ\\x80\\x9d, what every programmer first writes on a new piece of hardware.  CLOAD Magazine purchased it for $75, they distributed it to their subscribers on a cassette (there werenâ\\x80\\x99t disks for the TRS-80 yet).  It was 1979. I was 15 years old, and I was a software entrepreneur.  I still am.Just five years later, I was an intern at Apple writing some of the first native assembly language on the Mac and working in a building called Bandley 4 with a pirate flag on the roof. Guy Kawasaki hired me to help developers write software on the Mac without using its predecessor, the Lisa (something that had been required when the Mac launched). My first example of how to write for the MDS 68000 development system manifested itself in a video game called &#8220;Raid on Armonk.&#8221; It was an allusion to IBMâ\\x80\\x99s headquarters. They were the anti-Mac and we clicked and destroyed them. (Turns out they eventually clicked on themselves.)I&#8217;m sentimental this week, and thinking about the past, because I have seen the future.  The future is not a Mac, or even a PC.  Its father created a lot of the computers Iâ\\x80\\x99ve loved: Apple IIe, Mac, and iPhone.  There have been others I have loved, even some PCs and yes, my Blackberry, but none of that matters anymore. Looking ahead, I am energized, a door is opening, and we are all going to walk through it.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ll soon enter a new world of computing accelerated once again by the industry&#8217;s creator Steve Jobs, and amplified by someone conceived after the PC, Mark Zuckerberg.The future of our industry now looks totally different than the past. It looks like a sheet of paper, and itâ\\x80\\x99s called the iPad. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not about typing or clicking; itâ\\x80\\x99s about touching.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s not about text, or even animation, itâ\\x80\\x99s about video.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s not about a local disk, or even a desktop, itâ\\x80\\x99s about the cloud.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s not about pulling information; itâ\\x80\\x99s about push.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s not about repurposing old software, itâ\\x80\\x99s about writing everything from scratch (because you want to take advantage of the awesome potential of the new computers and the new cloudâ\\x80\\x94and because you have to reach this pinnacle).  Finally, the industry is fun again.Last week I gave presentations to more than 60 CIOs in various meetings throughout America&#8217;s heartland.  My message to them:  We are moving from Cloud 1 to Cloud 2, and the iPad is the accelerator. Many of them haven&#8217;t even made it to Cloud 1â\\x80\\x94some are still on mainframes. They are working on MVS/CICS, or Lotus Notes, and they have never heard of Cocoa, or even that there is now HTML 5.  This is unacceptable. The next generation is here. The iPad that shows us what now is really possibleâ\\x80\\x94and that we all need to go faster. Unfortunately, some CIOs would rather retire than go faster.Cloud 1 &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;Cloud 2Type/Click&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;TouchYahoo/Amazon&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;&gt;FacebookTabs&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&gt;FeedsChat&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&gt;VideoPull&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;PushCreate&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;ConsumeLocation Unknown&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;Location KnownDesktop/notebook&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;Smart phone/TabletWindows/Mac&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&gt;Cocoa/HTML 5What&#8217;s most exciting is that this fundamental transformationâ\\x80\\x94cloud + social + iPadâ\\x80\\x94will inspire a new generation of wildly innovative new apps that will change entire industries. Take health. We have all been waiting for the health application that will revolutionize how we share and communicate with our doctors, and help us make better health care decisions.  The apps we have seen as first generation EHR/PHR just have not cut it, and now with ObamaCare there is no killer app to accelerate through the new EHR reimbursement program.  The shift ignited by the iPad will allow the proliferation of these new missing apps, and automate the industries and professionals left behind by the last generation of technology.  Now, no industry will be left behind.It was on TechCrunch in late February that I first suggested that the enterprise software industry has to move forward and posted an article, &#8220;The Facebook Imperative.&#8221; In 1999, I was obsessed with the question, &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t all enterprise software like Amazon.com? And in 2010, the question evolved: &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t all enterprise software like Facebook?&#8221; This week we will have the answer to that question in our hands with the iPad. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a more productive, easier, and fun way to work and live.  The iPad shows us the old world is no longer good enough. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll need new software with a new UI.Our industry has gone through many shifts, but ultimately, the big ones have always been about software, not hardware.  Now, we are seeing a simultaneous software and hardware revolution. The key apps we use in productivity, collaboration, communication, entertainment, education, and even health, will all be rewritten to take advantage of the new capabilities.  This will result in a new generation that looks more like Facebook on the iPad than Yahoo on the PC.  Our industry is changing. We all need to step up to meet this change head-on or we will leave an incredible opportunity behind.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There&#8217;s a very interesting rumor circulating around out there right now. Apparently, Google is about to announce some sort of new partnership involving its Chrome browser and Adobe&#8217;s Flash platform, CNET reported earlier today as a rumor.Google isn&#8217;t talking, but what we&#8217;re hearing is that this could be related to the Open Screen Project that Google signed up for late last year. The project, started by Adobe a year ago, aims to give web developers a unified platform for content across a range of devices. The reason Google cares about this is its Android mobile operating system, and undoubtedly its future foray into netbooks with Chrome OS later this year.CNET&#8217;s report is short on details other than talk of a &#8220;deeper partnership&#8221; between Google and Adobe that may see Flash integrated into the Chrome browser more-so than it already is. What that means isn&#8217;t clear at all, since Flash is brought to all browsers by way of a plug-in that&#8217;s included with almost all browsers already. Of course, how plug-ins will work in Chrome OS isn&#8217;t entirely clear yet either, so it is possible this partnership could mean something along those lines.But more interesting than the actual news may be the symbolic gesture of a tighter partnership between Google and Adobe. After all, Google appears to be in the early stages of a war with former buddy Apple. The same Apple that refuses to put Flash on the iPhone. And the same Apple that won&#8217;t include Flash on the iPad, which is launching on Saturday. And the same Apple that has a CEO which has supposedly taken shots at the technology recently, while trying to convince partners to give it up â\\x80\\x94 which appears, at least in part, to be working.Something else interesting: Google offering more Flash-support would seem to go against its very public support of the HTML5 standard. Just about every new project Google launches these days, from Wave to Buzz, pushes HTML5 in some way. And a big part of HTML5 is the video component, which will allow users to play web videos without requiring a plug-in like Flash. Google has even made HTML5 available for YouTube videos, which previously only worked with Flash.So on one hand, Google seems to be saying that HTML5 is the future, while on the other perhaps suggesting that the web still needs Flash. Flash, undoubtedly, won&#8217;t be dying anytime soon, and so of course Google needs to support it (just as Apple&#8217;s Safari web browser does). But to suggest that Flash may be the unifying force for the web (as the Open Screen Project points to), seems to go against their argument that HTML5 is that same unifying force. And I can&#8217;t help but wonder if this is all just about positioning itself against Apple again. I guess we&#8217;ll learn more tomorrow.[photo: flickr/jem]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;ve long suspected that the basic usage pattern for Twitter is that people try it, don&#8217;t get it or become discouraged because they don&#8217;t know anyone else on it, but it grows on them eventually until they start using it every day.  Many people, of course, never come back, but for those who do, they need to get past that familiarity curve before it becomes an essential communications tool.  Now I have some data to back up my theory.  Social media analytics company Sysomos just released some data based on its analysis of over one billion Tweets which shows the contribution of updates by how long people have been on the service.  The most active users are those who joined Twitter more than nine months ago. They account for 41.6 percent of all Tweets.  New users are also active as they try to figure out the service, with newbies who joined less than 3 months ago contributing 22 percent of all Tweets.  Then it falls to 15.9 percent of all Tweets for people who joined between 3 and 6 months ago (the trough of discouragement), and 20.5 percent of all Tweets for those who joined 6 to 9 months ago.  The trend is pretty consistent.  There is a big bounce in Tweets from people who managed to stick around more than nine months.Sysomos&#8217; data also shows that international growth is outpacing the U.S., with the growth in Tweets hitting 8 percent overseas, compared to 5 percent in the U.S. so far in March.  That is down from 13 percent and 10 percent growth, respectively, in January.  In terms of total Tweets, Sysomos estimates there are now 53 million Tweets a day, which is up 30 percent since December, 2009.  Twitter passed the 50-million Tweet mark about a month ago.

       "  'comments_content': 'The Wall Street Journal has just published an article that states that Apple is currently working on a new iPhone model to be released this summer.  This shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone (the last three iPhones have all been released during either June or July) but the report also includes one big red juicy tidbit: there&#8217;s a CDMA iPhone in the works as well, and it&#8217;s scheduled for mass production in September by Pegatron Technology Corp.CDMA is of course the wireless technology used by Verizon (AT&amp;T and most other operators worldwide use GSM) â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it&#8217;s the reason you can&#8217;t buy an unlocked iPhone and get it working on Verizon.  The WSJ&#8217;s report notes that these CDMA phones are scheduled to be produced in September, but that it isn&#8217;t clear when Apple might make them available.For years now, there have been rumors about a Verizon version of the iPhone, but Apple has maintained its exclusive relationship with AT&amp;T since the iPhone first launched in 2007 (much to the chagrin of many iPhone users, who have suffered from AT&amp;T&#8217;s inability to cope with the high data demand, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco and New York).Despite those problems, it&#8217;s not a forgone conclusion that Apple will be opening the iPhone up to Verizon. Apple recently reaffirmed its confidence in AT&amp;T during its quarterly earnings report and has partnered with the company to provide the iPad&#8217;s data service.That said, there&#8217;s reason to believe that Apple may be finally ready to move away from its exclusivity contract. For one, it&#8217;s probably not keen on allowing Android to monopolize the smartphone market among customers tethered to Verizon.  And there&#8217;s another reason to believe this report is on the mark: one of the article&#8217;s three co-authors is Yukari Iwatani Kane, who has previously penned some very accurate, exclusive Apple articles â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0to the point that we&#8217;ve suspected that Apple itself may have previously leaked some information to her (they&#8217;ve used controlled leaks before).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'With the iPad launching on Saturday in the U.S., Apple&#8217;s stock price continues to rise. Today, shares closed at $232.39, another all time high. Notably, this push Apple&#8217;s market cap past $210 billion for the first time, as it&#8217;s now as $210.73 billion. But even more notably is that Apple is now under $50 billion away from its chief rival, Microsoft.Microsoft ended the day down slightly, to close at $29.60. This pushed Microsoft&#8217;s market cap to $259.61 billion. As I wrote, it&#8217;s now a question of when Apple will pass Microsoft in value, not if.Apple&#8217;s initial stock of iPads is believed to be sold out already leading up to Saturday. Orders made today on Apple&#8217;s website won&#8217;t be delivered until April 12, for example. Estimates have pre-order numbers as high as 240,000. And that doesn&#8217;t include the unit being sold at Best Buys across the country on launch day, as was just announced. All-told, it should be another blockbuster weekend for Apple, and its stock price come Monday could reflect that.But wait, there&#8217;s more.Remember, that this initial launch of the iPad is U.S.-only and only includes the WiFi version of the device. At the end of April, Apple will make the device available in several other big markets around the world, and it will launch the 3G version of its device in the U.S. with AT&amp;T.That will push us into May where Apple could have more tricks up its sleeve. New MacBooks and Mac Pros have been rumored for a while now with new Intel chips. Apple could simply be waiting for the iPad hoopla to die down before unveiling those.And then there&#8217;s the ace.While the dates for Apple&#8217;s WWDC event haven&#8217;t be publicized yet, you can expect that to take place in June â\\x80\\x94 likely the end of June. There, Apple will undoubtedly unveil yet another new version of the iPhone. What&#8217;s interesting is that it hasn&#8217;t yet held an event to show off a new SDK for a new iPhone OS as it usually does before the WWDC hardware-unveiling. The iPad will run iPhone OS 3.2, but 4.0 is definitely said to be in the works. It seems unlikely at this point that Apple would hold an SDK event in May because that would give developers only a few weeks to play with it before a launch alongside the new hardware. So it&#8217;s possible the new SDK will be shown off later, to be released later this year.Regardless, this is shaping up to be another blockbuster summer for Apple. And when it&#8217;s all over, that $50 billion gap may be much closer than Microsoft would like.Update: And for more on that new Summer iPhone â\\x80\\x94 and what could be a Verizon iPhone in the Fall&#8230;CrunchBase Information',\n",

In February, 2010, the young site attracted 3.9 million visitors worldwide, up from 944,000 in January, 2010, according to the latest data from comScore (see chart above).  Google Trends for Websites shows a similar growth curve, with about 500,000 unique daily visitors.The quadrupling of visitors measured by comScore coincided with the relatively new site being discovered by news sites and blogs. Â\\xa0It may just indicate the intense level of curiosity about the site, which matches random people together in a simple video chat environment.  When you get bored (or creeped out) you can click to start a new session.  Or it may be tapping into the basic human need to communicate.  It gives &#8220;instant communications&#8221; a whole new meaning.ComScore also estimates that the average visit on Chatroulette lasted 2.8 minutes, up from 2.4 minutes in January.  And the average visitor spent a total of 10.4 minutes on the site during the month, suggesting between three and four visits each. Other data we&#8217;ve published indicates that Chatroulette is 89 percent male and 13 percent perverts (there are a lot of naked guys hanging out on Chatroulette flashing each other).   The site already had its Daily Show moment and is inspiring some viral videos like the now-famous Chatroulette piano improv guy, Merton (see below).

Even if you think the service is useful and/or cool to look at, you have to admit there&#8217;s something creepy about Google cars driving around countries collecting these data with cameras mounted on the roof. And it appears that someone in Germany had just about enough of that.Police are investigating an incident in Oldenburg, Germany where a parked Google Street View car was vandalized overnight (in German &#8211; rough English translation). Apparently, the perpetrator let the air out of the car&#8217;s tires and also cut a wire that hooks the roof-mounted camera up with the inside of the car. It seems that nothing was stolen from the car, and none of the equipment on the outside was even taken. So it would seem this is clearly just a sign of protest against Google.And actually, the person who did the act was nice enough to leave a note on the windshield of the car letting the driver know that the air was let out of the tires (not to mention that they only let the air out, rather than slashing them).

So far, nothing.A new service called Attention Auction isn&#8217;t going to fix that problem, either. But it&#8217;s a start. People bid to get you to read their email. You find someone you want to contact, see how many other messages are in their inbox and how they are priced, and then bid for your message to get in the line. If your message isn&#8217;t read you can increase the price and push it higher in the queue. As a recipient you&#8217;ll see messages sorted from the highest price to the lowest. Open the message and get paid.Stuff like this can turn opening your inbox from a nightmare into a way to pay for the morning Starbucks. And it isn&#8217;t just for people that get a lot of inbound attention. It&#8217;s also a way for advertisers to reach people in a non-spammy way. Particularly if profile information is available to help target those ads so they&#8217;re not completely useless.Yes, this type of thing has been tried before, most famously by AllAdvantage in 1999, which paid users to view ads online. Ether lets people charge for phone calls, but hasn&#8217;t really gotten much traction. Attention Auction probably won&#8217;t do any better than they did in the end. The site is buggy and only works some of the time, which doesn&#8217;t exactly build a lot of trust. But I like the idea, particularly if it was integrated directly into Gmail and other webmail products.So how about it, Google? Why not let people pay me to read their email? You can even take a cut of it for yourself. Or maybe AOL will give it a try, they say they&#8217;re going to be doing some interesting new things with email.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Update: See this post for a likely explanation on why Buzz appears to be sending almost no traffic referrals. It is, in essence, a black hole.In the 2000 elections, incumbent Republican Senator John Ashcroft was defeated by Governor Mel Carnahan in the race for one of Missouri&#8217;s U.S. Senate seats. The only problem? Carnahan was dead.I&#8217;m reminded of this while looking over the traffic logs for TechCrunch, because it appears that someone else is losing to a dead rival: Google Buzz. According to our data, in the past month, Google Buzz has been sending less traffic to TechCrunch than FriendFeed â\\x80\\x94 the service which is essentially the same as Buzz, only better, and ever since the acquisition by Facebook has been a ghost town.But apparently, a ghost town still sends more traffic than the much buzzed-about Buzz. In the past month, FriendFeed is the #52 referrer of traffic to TechCrunch (in its heyday, it was occasionally in the top 20), Google Buzz, meanwhile, is at best #55. I say &#8220;at best&#8221; because it&#8217;s hard to know exactly how much traffic Buzz is sending because it&#8217;s built into Gmail. But still, I&#8217;ve drilled down into the subdomains to look for clues that it&#8217;s Buzz sending the traffic. Obviously, a solid chunk from the mail.google.com domain is coming from Buzz, and also some from google.com where Google Buzz profiles are hosted.Looking over a handful of popular stories on TechCrunch over the past month, Google Buzz is nowhere to be seen anywhere near the top referrers. This, along with conversations I&#8217;ve had with others about their referrals leads me to believe that Buzz is actually quite horrible at doing the job it set out to do: share information. What&#8217;s the point of sharing links on Buzz and having other people comment and like it if no one is actually reading any of the content itself? The TechCrunch account has some 7,700 followers (and when you added in individual author accounts that also share our posts, we have well over 10,000 followers) and yet we&#8217;re seeing hardly any traffic from the social service. And that&#8217;s after we even made our own Buzz button.All that being said, there is evidence that Buzz is helping to boost sharing on Google Reader, because it did help make Google Profiles more social. But still, Reader shares a miniscule when compared to rivals Twitter and Facebook. And again, Buzz was supposed to be the service that made sharing super-easy. And it&#8217;s shoved in the face of Gmail&#8217;s hundreds of millions of users, so these referral numbers are pretty pathetic.While it may be a ghost town, FriendFeed remains the example of what Buzz should be when it comes to sharing content. One reason it still destroys Buzz: Twitter. For much of its life, tweets accounted for most of the data coming into FriendFeed. Early on, with a built-in Twitter account link, tweets were also popular on Buzz. The problem is that Buzz inexplicably delays tweets for as many as 12 hours before bulk importing them all from the day â\\x80\\x94 which is beyond annoying. For this reason, myself and others have unsubscribed from anyone on Buzz who imports tweets. Google has access to Twitter&#8217;s firehose, so I have no idea why they can&#8217;t import these tweets in realtime, as the small FriendFeed team was able to do. Undoubtedly, that would help with the sharing problem.But Google may not want to do that. After all, it&#8217;s not trying to build just another front-end for Twitter. It wants to be its own service â\\x80\\x94 one of Facebook proportions. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just not happening right now. And I&#8217;m seriously starting to doubt if it ever will. Those changes can&#8217;t come soon enough.[image: Miramax]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Things are not going great at Elevation Partners. Its initial $1.8 billion fund &#8211; that was met with great fanfare when it was raised by rockstar investor Roger McNamee, rockstar gaming executive John Riccitiello and actual rockstar Bono &#8211; is about 70% invested and the two biggest deals are duds. Elevation invested some $300 million in Forbes and a whopping $460 million in Palmâ\\x80\\x94a company with a stock hovering around $4 per share, down some 75% since October.Yet, things arenâ\\x80\\x99t quite as bad as they look from the outside for two reasons. First: Elevation has hedged its risky strategy of putting so much money behind a few bets by concocting a complex system of puts and convertible issues that limit the downside of its worse deals. For instance, even with Palm at the lowly $4 a share, Elevation roughly breaks even on the fund, which not every venture fund raised in 2005 can say for itself.The second reason? The fund secretly bought up some $90 million of Facebook shares on the secondary market late last year. One person with knowledge of the transaction told us: This deal &#8211; which anyone with $90 million could have struck &#8211; could be the only thing that tips the fund in the black, a crucial bragging point as Elevation gets ready to think about raising its second fund in a brutal fundraising environment.The price Elevation Partners paid for Facebook stock? We&#8217;ve heard it was around $30/share, which is roughly in line with the (smaller) transactions occurring on SecondMarket at the time. That values Facebook at roughly $13 billion, double what DST paid for common stock just a few months earlier.Itâ\\x80\\x99s ironic that a team that was billed as an investing dream team with deep contacts in every facet of media and technology may be saved by a deal that required no contacts and little deal making or company building expertise. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also ironic that it took a secondary market purchase for Elevation to invest in Facebook, given the tight ties between the two companies. Roger McNamee is a personal investor and informal advisor to the company, Bono is a personal investor in Facebook too, and Elevation partner Mark Bodnick is married to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandbergâ\\x80\\x99s sister. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s one chummy bunch.Sources close to the firm say that Elevation has several deals in public and private companies that havenâ\\x80\\x99t been announced that hedge itâ\\x80\\x99s not-so-hot Forbes and Palm bets.Such deals aside, there are three legitimate concerns for Elevation that are weighing on limited partners as they consider re-upping in the firm. The first is Elevationâ\\x80\\x99s clear change in strategy. This was a fund launched to make big bets in media, gaming and music, and it has clearly veered from that strategy. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not necessarily a bad thingâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s a graveyard of online music companies and other than Pandora, few that look like winners. And when Riccitiello left Elevation to head up EA, he obviously took a lot of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s video game expertise with him. (He was kind enough to give the firm its best exit buying BioWare/Pandemic Studios for a combined $860 million.) But if Elevation isnâ\\x80\\x99t that any more, the question is what kind of firm is it? Recent hires of former Apple Software chief Avie Tevanian and eBay executive Rajiv Dutta indicate the firm indeed intends to raise a second fund and indicate to continued deal making in devices and the Web.The second concern is how engaged Roger McNamee still is in Elevation. McNameeâ\\x80\\x94long hair and outrageous statements asideâ\\x80\\x94is one of the top public and private market investors in Valley history. So what of his deal judgment with Forbes and Palm? Worse is the concern that McNamee has checked out, spending more and more time touring with his band Moon Alice while Elevation falters. McNamee carries about six smart phones with him at a time, so heâ\\x80\\x99s no doubt wired in, but even the appearance of being MIA has to be worrisome to investors.And then, thereâ\\x80\\x99s Palm again. Itâ\\x80\\x99s 20% of the fund and has the ability to make or break it. Back in October when Palm was trading at $18 a share, Elevation had one of the best IRRs in the business. Palm isnâ\\x80\\x99t looking good in the smart phone wars thanks to some crucial execution mistakes when there was already little room for error. These mistakes include announcing the Pre months before it was available, launching with Sprint and botching its Verizon roll-out. Not exactly inspiring moves for a company making its comeback.That said, the idea that Palm will go to zero being pushed by some of the many people shorting the stock is a stretch. The company has six quarters of revenue in the bank and even if it canâ\\x80\\x99t compete in the smart phone market, itâ\\x80\\x99s an easy acquisition target. Palmâ\\x80\\x99s strength has always been its software, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s the precise weakness of most handset vendors who arenâ\\x80\\x99t named Apple. Will Palm be the win Elevation was hoping for? No. But that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean itâ\\x80\\x99s worthless.Similarly, Elevation will almost assuredly have a harder time raising its second fund. Some LPs will likely walk, and the fund may be smaller. But if Facebook can push it into the black, there likely will be another $1 billion out there to gamble on Elevation again.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have just approved Cisco&#8217;s $3.4 billion acquisition of video conferencing company Tandberg.  According to the release, the transaction remains subject to review in Brazil; however, the antitrust approvals from the European Commission and Justice Department represent the final regulatory approvals required before the transaction can close. The deal, which was announced last Fall,  is expected to close in the coming weeks. Cisco and the Norway and New York-based Tandberg both develop competing tele- conferencing technologies. The release says that the European Commission took into account Cisco&#8217;s ambitions to incorporate Tandberg&#8217;s technologies to further &#8220;interoperability between its multi-screen video conferencing products and competitive products.&#8221; As a condition of the approval of the deal, Cisco is required to appoint an independent monitor, who must be approved by the Commission, to oversee the implementation of these commitments. Once the Commission approves the independent monitor, the deal can close. Cisco recently bought up Rohati Systems, and acquired the set-top box business of one of China&#8217;s largest cable companies, DVN, for $44.5 million. This deal was peanuts compared to Cisco&#8217;s other 2009 acquisitions including the acquisition of ScanSafe for $183 million. And last fall, Cisco  announced a $2.9 billion acquisition of mobile networking infrastructure provider Starent Networks. It&#8217;s been quite a shopping spree for Cisco; and it must be a relief to have its most expensive purchase finally approved.Photo credit/Flickr/TedPercivalCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The pending $30 billion merger of Comcast and NBC-Universal is going to complicate things for Hulu, the second most popular online video site after YouTube.  Hulu is a joint venture between NBC, News Corp/Fox, and (since last year) Disney/ABC.  It was created by the TV networks as a counterweight to YouTube, a safe place where they could run their full-length TV shows online with their own ads.  Comcast, however, is championing TV Everywhere, which is an entirely different model for professionally-produced Web video.  TV Everywhere is going to put TV channels online behind a paywall where only existing cable subscribers can watch them.  Once Comcast owns a part of Hulu, there will be more pressure to put parts of Hulu behind a paywall as well.One knowledgeable industry source speculates that &#8220;Comcast will push Hulu very hard to become an authenticated destination for TV Everywhere.&#8221;  If that happens, Hulu could end up offering less free content and more premium shows.  In this scenario, there will be a two-tiered system.  Some shows will be available for free, but a larger selection will be available only to paying cable subscribers.TV Everywhere will work on a federated model.  Comcast might have its own TV Everywhere portal, giving its subscribers access to many of the channels they get on their TVs.  But individual networks can also set up their own online video sites available only to &#8220;authenticated&#8221; subscribers.  HBO Go is an example of one such federated site.  Hulu could set up become another authenticated site, offering the TV Everywhere fare only behind the paywall.Ever since the Comcast-NBC merger was announced, questions have swirled about what will happen to Hulu and free TV on the Web.  While NBC says it &#8220;has no plans to remove the kind of shows currently offered over the Internet on an ad-supported basis,&#8221; both NBC and Comcast refuse to guarantee that current or future TV shows will be available for free online.Media companies in general seem to be backing away from Hulu.  For instance, Viacom recently pulled two of the most popular shows from Hulu, The Colbert Report and The Daily Show.  Now the prospect of a two-tiered Hulu may confuse things even more for consumers.Photo credit: Flickr/Richard DurdlCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Browser maker Opera Software has released its latest &#8216;State of the Mobile Web&#8217; report this morning, which is based on the usage of its Opera Mini browser for mobile phones. Each month, the conclusion is always the same: mobile web usage around the world keeps on growing and growing. In February, Opera Mini had over 50.5 million users, a 1.7% increase from January 2010 and more than 145% increase compared to February 2009.Opera says that the 50 million plus users viewed more than 22 billion pages in February, which actually represents a 6% decrease from January (Opera claims this is because February only has 28 days compared to Januaryâ\\x80\\x99s 31.) Since February 2009, page views have increased by 200%. In February, Opera Mini users generated over 330 million MB of data, with consumption down by 1.9%. Since February 2009, data traffic is up over 164%. The top 10 countries for Opera Mini usage in February remained the same with users  mainly centralized in Russia, Indonesia, India, China, Ukraine, South Africa, Nigeria, the United States, Vietnam and the United Kingdom. Opera claims that people browsing with Opera Mini (in the top 10 countries according to unique users) spent approximately $103.8 million in data costs, which if tallied for 12 months, represents a potential of $1.25 billion per year. Opera calculates this based on usage and the average cost of browsing in each country. Opera calculates this number based upon using $1 per megabyte as a global average. While $1.25 billion seems like a big reach for Opera, you can imagine what the users of more popular browsers like mobile Safari or Android are spending. Per users, Opera Mini users spent approximately $4 on average in the month of February, which comes out to $48 per year. The heaviest spending occurs in the United States ($146.40 user/year) and the United Kingdom ($102/user/year), whereas the least spending occurs in India ($8.76/user/year) and South Africa ($11.52/user/year), which is mostly due to data costs in these countries, as opposed to the amount of data transferred.\\tSpecifically in North America,  February 2009 to February 2010, page views in the top 11 countries of North America and the Caribbean increased by 153%, unique users increased by 109% and data transferred increased by 84%. In terms of specific sites used in the U.S. among mobile Web users, Google is at the top of the rankings, with Facebook coming in second and Yahoo in third. In the United States and Canada, BlackBerry handsets occupy the number 1 spot. Of course,  BlackBerry takes the top spot because iPhone and Android users both have powerful browsers, nullifying the need to use Opera Mini.However, Opera just submitted an application for an Opera Mini app for the iPhone, which it claims is up to 6 times faster than the native browser thanks to its compression and server-side rendering technology. We&#8217;ll see if the app is approved.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

This equates to an equity value of about $252 million and a transaction value of approximately $594 million, assuming net debt for Bell of $342 million at face value as of December 31, 2009. The acquisition has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is subject to the approval of Bell&#8217;s shareholders as well as customary regulatory approvals.

The company was founded in 1988 and employs over 1,900 employees in 55 offices around the world. In calendar year 2009, Bell registered sales of approximately $3 billion &#8211; it currently expects to generate first quarter 2010 sales of $795 million to $815 million.Avnet has been around for way longer: originally founded by Charles Avnet in 1921, it was incorporated in 1955 and went public 4 years later. The company boasts offices in over 300 locations across the globe, and employs roughly 12,000 people.Avnet&#8217;s share price ticked off at 28.37 in recent trading and boasts a $4.3 billion market cap &#8211; Bell shares are up 28% in pre-market trading.CrunchBase Information',\n",

In addition to merging with Zhura, Scripped also announced that it has raised $250,000 in new funding from private angel investors.

Like Scripped, the company provides screenwriters with tools that enable them to work on their writings online, whether individually or in collaboration with other writers, friends or even the Web community as a whole. Amusingly, the Zhura website still boasts a list of application features in comparison with other players in this space &#8230; including Scripped.Scripped, founded in 2008, used to be based in Los Angeles, but has recently moved to San Francisco to become part of technology incubator i/o ventures (more about them here).

Benchmark Capital has led the round and general partner Matt Cohler has taken a board seat at the company (Cohler is a former Facebook exec). Both Quora and Benchmark have confirmed the funding, but they won&#8217;t comment on the size of the round or the valuation. Our source for the story says it was an $11 million round that valued the company at $86 million. Additional investors may join the round as well.Elevation Partners was also rumored to have bid aggressively on the deal.Quora first launched in private beta on January 4, 2010, just a few months ago. To get in you have to convince a current user to use one of their ten invitations on you. It&#8217;s one of the hottest private beta tickets in town. And for a question and answer site that&#8217;s saying something.But there&#8217;s a magic to Quora that has captured Silicon Valley&#8217;s imagination. Something about the quality of the people and the content. Real discussions break out on Quora all the time. The signal to noise ratio is extremely high.I sat down with Cofounders Adam D&#8217;Angelo and Charlie Cheever, and new investor Matt Cohler, to talk with them about what makes Quora so special. My notes from the interview are below.When will Quora launch publicly?Thereâ\\x80\\x99s not going to be a big sudden open.  Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to gradually open things up over time. One thing weâ\\x80\\x99re really focused on is just getting high quality content on the site, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a tension between suddenly letting in everyone when we donâ\\x80\\x99t have policies and procedures to manage them. We de want to get a lot of users, we just want to be ready for them.Ready for them from a scaling standpoint or a community standpoint?Community management product and policy standpoint.What were some of the early product ideas that you had that you threw away?  How did the process go from â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re going to start a companyâ\\x80\\x9d to what it is today?We knew we wanted to do a question and answer system.  We didnâ\\x80\\x99t know exactly how the details were going to work.  Over the first six months starting a year ago, we were still doing a lot of the details and figuring out how the product was going to work.  From that point on, it was just executing on building the product. With all the Q&amp;A sites already out there it seems like this was a saturated market. Why go in this direction?We didnâ\\x80\\x99t actually say that this is a market that we want to be part of, and we werenâ\\x80\\x99t actually focused on the other Q&amp;A sites. The way we think about this is thereâ\\x80\\x99s actually a lot of information thatâ\\x80\\x99s still in peopleâ\\x80\\x99s heads thatâ\\x80\\x99s not on the internet.  And when you think about it you would say that probably 90% of the information that people have is still in their heads, not on the internet.  So weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to get that information out of peopleâ\\x80\\x99s heads, so itâ\\x80\\x99s not on sources that are hard to access on the internet, and get it into a really useful format to make a valuable database.What makes Quora so special? Why are people raving about it?I donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s any one thing, but itâ\\x80\\x99s a bunch of little things. Part of it is the right audience.  Instead of just Q&amp;A, we think about this as blogging. Some people call it inverse blogging or reverse blogging.  When you write a blog post, you write to your audience.  When you write on TechCrunch, you know that these people are expecting techie news about startups.When you come to a question page on Quora and itâ\\x80\\x99s blank there are a bunch of people waiting for the answer. An expert will look at it and say â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s an audience here and I know exactly what they want to hear.  And I actually know about this stuff, or know enough to research and produce a really interesting piece of content, and itâ\\x80\\x99s going to go to the perfectly targeted audience who opted in to hearing about this.â\\x80\\x9dWhen we worked on building the infrastructure for the product we also worked on building a website that works in realtime, so you can be up to date and it feels really alive.People say they feel smarter after they use Quora.Quora is an insidersâ\\x80\\x99 forum for Silicon Valley right now.  At some point, how does this not become Yahoo answers, which is just a little bit of everything but not really deep on anything?Part of it is making it so you see the stuff that you care about but you donâ\\x80\\x99t see the other stuff.  I think a lot of services lately have done a better and better job of that. Users follow topics and people that they&#8217;re interested in and that information is highlighted for them.Why did you decide to get outside funding?  I imagine that you could have continued to fund this for the foreseeable future on your own.We think this is a really challenging problem.  When you think of all of the abstract knowledge that is in peopleâ\\x80\\x99s heads and getting it into a useful format and getting it on the internet.  We think itâ\\x80\\x99s going to take a lot of work and itâ\\x80\\x99s going to require a lot of really smart people, and this funding is going to let us do that. And this gets Benchmark involved.  And it gets Matt involved.Weâ\\x80\\x99re hiring engineers and designers, thatâ\\x80\\x99s another reason why we raised this money. To grow quickly and hire a lot of smart people, because weâ\\x80\\x99re going to need them.As the service grows how will you avoid &#8220;pulling a Twitter&#8221; and having massive downtime?Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty confident we can deal with the scaling challenges.  Community management is a big thing and the information here is so rich. These are the things that smart people need to work on and figure out. Matt, why is this an interesting investment for you?Because the people are extraordinary. That and theyâ\\x80\\x99re going after a really big, interesting problem (getting the 90% of information thatâ\\x80\\x99s in peopleâ\\x80\\x99s heads onto the web in a way thatâ\\x80\\x99s usable).  Itâ\\x80\\x99s still in closed beta, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s already some evidence that thatâ\\x80\\x99s happening. The real goal of Quora is to accumulate this valuable knowledge. Itâ\\x80\\x99s kind of like Wikipedia. This is the long tail of information.On Wikipedia people fight over what the text is going to say and it gets boring.  Here you have none of that. You have conversations. I do think thereâ\\x80\\x99s a distinction between answers and discussion.  The userbase seems to do a pretty good job of distinguishing between answers and questions and comments. One thing we talk about with the product is continually improving, and having the pages on the site be a good resource.   If thereâ\\x80\\x99s a ton of different anecdotal answers, then someone comes along and summarizes all of that. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Videos powered by Brightcove, for instance, will stream in an HTML5 video player when it detects an iPad.  On the iPhone browser, the video thumbnail will open up the Quicktime player.  It will also work on Android phones.  Brightcove CEO Jeremy Allaire is agnostic about the Flash Vs.

Flash canâ\\x80\\x99t reach those platforms for political and business reasons.&#8221;  But HTML5 simply cannot do everything Flash can, especially when it comes to supporting advertising, audience measurement, customized players, and social sharing.  So he decided to bring HTML5 video to parity with Flash for anyone who uses Brightcove. (Note that this is for videos playing in the browser.  Brightcove already supports video playback in iPhone apps).It will take until the end of the year to reach full parity with Flash, but that is his goal.  At first, Brightcove videos will play back in a very basic HTML5 player when they detect an iPad.  But over the next nine months or so, Brightcove will add the same audience measurement and advertising features available in its regular Flash player.  Brightcove will still display the video in Flash when the viewing device supports it, but for the iPad, iPhone, and even Android phones, videos will play in HTML5 and most viewers probably won&#8217;t notice the difference.Already today you can see who these videos work on the iPhone.  For example, Brightcove turned on the capability for Techcrunch videos such as this one when viewed in an iPhone browser.  When the iPad comes out, you will be able to watch our videos on there as well, along with videos on the sites of the New York Times and Time magazine, who also use Brightcove.Making HTML5 playback available is just something all video platforms will eventually do.  Ooyala is set to offer it for the iPad as well, and  YouTube is moving in that direction as well.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Never let it be said that I don&#8217;t admit when I&#8217;m wrong.I mean, granted,  I don&#8217;t particularly like being wrong &#8211; and I especially don&#8217;t like  being wrong in the full glare of the public spotlight. But on the  vanishingly small number of occasions when &#8211; due to some inexplicable  glitch in the universe &#8211; I happen to be wrong, never let it be said that  I don&#8217;t admit it.A case in point&#8230; I just stumbled across  an excellent post by biographer TJ Stiles, calling me out over my  claim that hardback books are a &#8216;cash cow&#8217; for the publishing  industry.&#8221;Let&#8217;s set the record straight,&#8221; said Mr Stiles, &#8220;publishers  (and authors) make much more money from hardcovers, it&#8217;s true. That is  one reason why they have always delayed the release of cheaper  paperbacks. But to refer to anything in publishing as a &#8216;cash cow&#8217; is to  suggest a level of profitability that simply does not exist in this  narrow-margin industry. &#8216;Life line&#8217; would be a better clichÃ©. Did  publishers cut that life line when the paperback was invented? No. Why  should they now for the e-book?&#8221;&#8230;and you know what? He&#8217;s  right. The phrase &#8216;cash cow&#8217; was misleading &#8211; it has echoes of fat cat  publishers making billions in profits when, in most cases nothing could  be further from the truth. &#8216;Life line&#8217; is a far better phrase. I was  wrong and &#8211; see! &#8211; I have no problem admitting it.Of course,  that&#8217;s hardly the admission of the decade: in cases like that, admitting  I was wrong doesn&#8217;t involve eating a whole lot of humble pie. A more  accurate test would be if I were to make a stratospheric misjudgment  about a major issue &#8211; a misjudgment that turned out to be so  embarrassing that I&#8217;d rather bury my head in a box on ants than admit to  my error. What would I do then?On Friday I was given the  opportunity to find out.A few months ago, in this very column, I  wrote about Rupert Murdoch and how he would never remove his  newspapers&#8217; content from Google&#8217;s index because he was too obsessed with  eyeballs&#8230;The numbers show that most searchers wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even notice if the Wall Street Journal and every other News Corp publication  vanished from their results. What would definitely happen, though, is a  huge drop in eyeballs and ad revenue for News Corp, which would  certainly cost Murdoch far more than he could hope to recoup from a deal  with Bing. Again, anyone familiar with the Sun (and its New York-based  cousin, the Post) will know that Rupert will always put his hunger for  eyeballs above his insistence that people pay for news â\\x80\\x93 to the point  where he is happy to slash cover prices to economically-suicidal levels  to win readers.My point was pretty unambiguous: unless Rupert  Murdoch has lost his mind, his obsession with eyeballs meant he would  never pull the plug on freely available online content. Rupert Murdoch  hasn&#8217;t lost his mind, ergo his content would stay free. And then on  Friday came this&#8230;Times and Sunday Times websites to charge  from JuneAnd you know what, I&#8217;m not afraid to say it.I  was wrong.Rupert Murdoch has lost his mind.Please  understand I don&#8217;t make that statement lightly. When it comes to  Murdoch, I&#8217;ve always been of the Michael Wolff school &#8211; doubting the  man&#8217;s Internet credentials (allegedly he still hasn&#8217;t ever used Google)  but at the same time respecting his business sense and his willingness  to defer to trusted advisors when it comes to his company&#8217;s digital  strategy. But with this latest decision it&#8217;s clear that he has not so  much lost his marbles as collected them together into a lead bag and  thrown them into the sea.Moving its content behind a pay-wall  will be the death of the Times; one of the world&#8217;s most respected  newspapers and a British national treasure. Even with a relatively  modest subscription cost of Â£1 ($1.60) a day or Â£2 for the whole week, it  has been shown time and time again that the hassle factor of making even  a small payment to access a website will result in a hemorrhaging of  readers. Unlike the Financial Times (no relation), only a small fraction  of the Times&#8217; online readership do so for business reasons &#8211; with most incorporating it into their general news diet. If it&#8217;s no longer free  they&#8217;ll simply get their news elsewhere.And then there&#8217;s the  drop in Google juice: News International is yet to announce its search  indexing policy for the new site but it&#8217;s safe to say that the pay-wall  will mean the vast majority of the paper&#8217;s news archive vanishing from  search engines.Â\\xa0 Times Online currently attracts 20 million unique  readers a month, most of whom will disappear overnight once the pay-wall  is erected.No matter which angle you look at Murdoch&#8217;s decision, it&#8217;s almost impossible to see it as anything other than a  sign of madness. But of course that hasn&#8217;t stopped some from trying to  spot some hint of method in it&#8230;James Harding, editor of The  Times, tried to put a brave face on his boss&#8217; decision &#8211; much like a  mid-ranking officer might try to justify to his men why Douglas Haig has ordered them to  go over the top during the Battle of the Somme. According to the BBC,  Harding &#8220;agreed that NI&#8217;s pay-wall strategy was a risk&#8230; but [argued  that] it&#8217;s less of a risk than just throwing away our journalism and  giving it away for free.&#8221;Nice try James, but that doesn&#8217;t really wash. For a start, complaining that making newspaper content available for  free online is somehow devaluing it is just plain stupid. For years  newspapers have been giving their paper editions away for free &#8211; on  airlines and in other high-traffic locations &#8211; on the basis that these  &#8220;bulks&#8221; will increase circulation figures and will in turn drive more  advertising. Once you factor in printing, distribution and returns, the  cover price of a newspaper &#8211; and let&#8217;s remember that Murdoch is the king  of slashing prices to drive competitors out of business &#8211; barely  covers the medium on which it&#8217;s delivered.Advertising has always been  the real revenue driver in print, to the point where Murdoch was quite  happy to give his &#8220;away for free&#8221; with the launch of a free London daily back in 2005 (it went out of business last year due to fierce  competition from another free paper from rivals Associated Newspapers).  The truth is that &#8211; as Jeff Jarvis writes in the Guardian &#8211; Murdoch  simply hasn&#8217;t been able to figure out how to make online advertising  work. And it&#8217;s that inability that has driven him to his current madness.There&#8217;s  a second problem with Harding&#8217;s argument: journalists and columnists  actually are quite keen on having their product given away free. No  matter whether we&#8217;re covering Iraq or fashion trends, we writers tend to  be egotists at heart, which is one of the reasons we&#8217;re prepared to  accept the reasonably shitty salaries offered by news organisations  rather than going in to, say, PR. Our reward isn&#8217;t so much money as the  knowledge that our work will be appreciated by a large audience. With  print circulation plummeting (the Times has gone from nearly 700,000  daily readers to 500,000 in the past five years), journalists want to  write for publications with large online audiences to ensure that their  reporting is seen by the masses.When Sirius hired Howard Stern they  had to pay him a hugely inflated salary to reflect the fact that he&#8217;d be  seeing a large and immediate drop in his listener numbers. Similarly,  by hiding its journalism behind a pay-wall, News International will have to pay vastly inflated salaries to attract the best an brightest  to its pages. And in an era where newspapers can barely afford to keep  the talent they have, that&#8217;s just another nail in the coffin.Really  the only possible reasoning &#8211; outside of madness &#8211; that&#8217;s left for  Murdoch&#8217;s behaviour is that he&#8217;s cleverer than all of us. Perhaps if we  just watch quietly we&#8217;ll soon see the true genius behind his plan. After  all, that&#8217;s what happened back in the 1980s and 90s when he launched  Sky Television &#8211; a British-based satellite TV channel. Back then no one  in the UK paid for television (we&#8217;d been brought up on free to air TV  with little or no demand for cable) and there were no signs that they were ready to start &#8211; and yet in less than a decade Sky  had become one of the country&#8217;s biggest broadcasters. The success of Sky  was down to the content &#8211; Murdoch bought the rights to broadcast  premium football (sorry, soccer) games, forcing millions of households  to sign up to Sky if they wanted to follow their favourite teams.  Perhaps that&#8217;s his plan with the Times as well &#8211; make the content of his  new online editions so unbelievably compelling that subscribers will be  forced to sign up in their droves?Nope, that doesn&#8217;t wash  either. With Sky, Murdoch was operating in a single market (the UK) with  a product (pay per view TV) that had already been proven overseas. With  Times Online, Murdoch is competing on a global stage and, unless the  Times is about to switch its editorial page over to porn, there&#8217;s no  example of anyone getting the paid news content model right for a  consumer audience so far.Especially not someone who is so afraid of the Internet that they  haven&#8217;t even used Google.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'One of about a half dozen tabs that I always have open in my web browser on my desktop or laptop is Google Reader. Even though other sources such as Twitter and Facebook are now better at uncovering news more quickly, Reader remains a great catch-all backup plan for the content I read online. But I&#8217;m increasingly finding myself browsing for news on my iPhone. And sadly, all the Google Reader applications that have launched over the past few years have, in my opinion, sucked. And I&#8217;m hardly the only one who thinks that. But that changes, today.An app called Reeder, by Silvio Rizzi, has always been a nice-looking app that syncs with Google Reader. Unfortunately, it has also been clunky, and slow, and lacking some features such as state-saving. But the latest version, 2.0, which just went live in the App Store last night, corrects all the issues I had with it. It&#8217;s wonderful. I have absolutely no doubt this will be one of my most-used apps now. In fact, I&#8217;m so sure of it, that I&#8217;ve already placed it on my the first page of apps on my iPhone screen.So what makes it so good? Well, first of all, it&#8217;s simple. Rather than trying to cram is all of the clutter items that Google Reader itself now crams into its own site, Reeder focuses on three key areas: Unread items, Starred items, and All items. These are the three key areas across the bottom of the app. The only other icon down there (on the main screen) is a reload button to load in new feed items. Assuming you group your feeds into folders in Google Reader, navigation is Reeder focuses on that. So, for example, when I click into my &#8220;tech&#8221; folder, I see all the unread feed items that have appeared since the last time I opened Google Reader. I can sort these by individual feeds or by time in which the items came in.Obviously, clicking on an individual story loads that item (including any images). And in the story-view mode you have a new set of options along the bottom that let you mark an item as unread, star it, or a button to load a range of great Reeder features. For example, on this overlay menu, you can make a Google Reader note about an item, you can share it with your Reader friends, you can save it to Instapaper, you can send it to Twitter, you can open it in Safari, you can mail it to someone, etc. There are a half dozen other features which you can customize in the app.But maybe my favorite feature of Reeder is the Tweetie-like ability to swipe an individual feed item to do something. In Tweetie, when you swipe a tweet, a bunch of options are shown under that tweet. In Reeder, it&#8217;s a bit different. Swiping right toggles an item between read and unread status. Swiping left toggles between starred and unstarred status. It&#8217;s brilliant. (And yes, there is also a button to mark all as read.)As you&#8217;d expect, Reeder gives you the ability to sync feed items locally so that you can read them when you don&#8217;t have an Internet connection, such as on a plane. Previously, as I mentioned, syncing was slow. With version 2.0, syncing speed screams. And, there is also an option to only cache images if you&#8217;re connected to WiFi, to keep things moving alone.If you haven&#8217;t been using the iPhone for a long time, news of a great feed reader may sound lackluster to you. After all, it&#8217;s been almost two years since the launch of the App Store now, it may be hard to believe that no one has nailed a simple feed reader app yet. But that has been the case. A few are okay, like NetNewsWire and Byline, but none have been great on the level that Tweetie is great as an iPhone Twitter client. In fact, I&#8217;d say the best feed reader on the iPhone up until now has been the mobile web version of Google Reader itself. But that too is only good, not great.With Reeder 2.0, I think we finally have a great iPhone feed reader. Its combination of speed, simplicity, and beauty make it a must-have app in my opinion. Now the only hard part will be waiting for a native iPad version to come out that supports things like dual-pane views to more easily go through feed items on the larger screen. But now I&#8217;m just being greedy. I&#8217;m just happy to finally have a solid feed reader on the iPhone.You can find Reeder 2.0 in the App Store here. It&#8217;s $2.99.

       "  'comments_content': 'Trying to control, or even manage, your online reputation is becoming increasingly difficult. And much like the fight by big labels against the illegal sharing of music, it will soon become pointless to even try. It&#8217;s time we all just give up on the small fights and become more accepting of the indiscretions of our fellow humans. Because the skeletons are coming out of the closet and onto the front porch.We&#8217;ll look back on the good old days when your reputation was really only on the line with eBay via confirmed, actual transactions and LinkedIn, where you can simply reject anyone who leaves bad feedback on your professional life.Today we have quick fire and semi or completely anonymous attacks on people, brands, businesses and just about everything else. And it is becoming increasingly findable on the search engines. Twitter, Yelp, Facebook, etc. are the new printing presses, and absolutely everyone, even the random wingnuts, have access.That picture of you making out with two guys in college up on Facebook. Or perhaps doing a bong hit after winning a few Olympic gold medals. The random slam against your restaurant anonymously left by the owner of the competitor around the corner. The Twitter flame about how bad a driver you are, complete with a link to a picture of your license plate.And it&#8217;s about to get a lot worse. Next week a startup is launching that&#8217;s effectively Yelp for people (look for our coverage in a few days). If someone has something good or bad to say about you, they&#8217;ll be able to do it anonymously and with very little potential legal or social fallout.We&#8217;ve seen services like this in the past. Rapleaf and iKarma come to mind. But they were flawed &#8211; Rapleaf now collects and sells data about people, and iKarma seems to be little more than a realtor focused service. Another service, Gorb, has vanished completely.But something tells me this new service, or some other one, might succeed where the others have failed. We&#8217;re primed and ready now and have lots of experience publishing all those random opinions about people and things on Twitter, Yelp and Facebook already. It&#8217;s time for a centralized, well organized place for anonymous mass defamation on the Internet. Scary? Yes. But it&#8217;s coming nonetheless.This has been on my mind for a long while now. Our minds haven&#8217;t evolved much over the last few thousands of years, but the spread of quick fire opinions is now moving at the speed of light and forever findable on the Internet. We&#8217;re still wired to think of gossip as something that spreads quietly behind the scenes, and relatively slowly. But we&#8217;re already in a world where it&#8217;s all completely public, there are few repercussions to the person spreading it, and it is easily searchable. No wonder people freak out. We&#8217;re fish out of water.Sure, we&#8217;ve evolved a legal infrastructure to deal with libel, slander and defamation. Those laws worked well in an era of the printing press, and sort of stretched to cover radio and television. But they are as ineffective against the Internet as copyright laws are in battling music piracy.Other services like Reputation Defender have launched to try to help people manage their online reputations. It can be somewhat effective unless your name gets into the press, which doesn&#8217;t back away easily from the stuff they publish. It&#8217;s relatively easy to bully someone into taking down that Twitter rant, or even that Facebook photo, with an official looking email or letter threatening legal action.But it&#8217;s much harder to get that stuff off of services that exist to publish that information. Businesses freak out over a bad Yelp review but can do little to stop it. Imagine how you&#8217;ll feel when the top result for your name is a site that includes &#8220;reviews&#8221; of you by anonymous people who know you.Sure, lots of feedback will be positive. But piss someone off at work and you&#8217;ll have &#8220;Sketchy and unethical in the workplace&#8221; pop up about you. And it will be there forever. Heck, your great-great-grandchildren will be reading it long after you&#8217;re gone.So What Happens Next?We&#8217;re going to be forced to adjust as a society. I firmly believe that we will simply become much more accepting of indiscretions over time. Employers just won&#8217;t care that ridiculous drunk college pictures pop up about you when they do a HR background search on you.Anyone who rises quickly in a corporate environment will have people complaining about you all the way up, and it will be easily findable via search. Basically, if someone doesn&#8217;t like you, even just for a moment, they&#8217;ll have the chance to hit you with an ambiguous but damaging anonymous statement. And it will be vague enough to stop any lawyer dead in her tracks from trying to get it removed, or from even learning the identity of the person who left the comment.So what will matter? Hard proof of being a bad person. Criminal records. Non-anonymous and clear statements of wrong doing that need to be addressed. Perhaps a picture of you actually committing a violent felony. That kind of thing.But the nonsense we&#8217;re all worried about today? I just don&#8217;t think it will carry the same weight in a few years. Because if there are pictures of the person hiring you smoking pot in college online, and there are pictures of every other candidate smoking pot in college online, it just won&#8217;t be a big deal any more.And the kind of accusations that can kill a career today will likely be seen as a badge of honor, and a sign of an ambitious individual who has pissed off a few people along the way.At least that&#8217;s what I hope will happen. Because there are a few pictures of me in high school and college that I&#8217;m tired of trying to keep off the Internet. Let&#8217;s just get it all out there sooner rather than later, and move on.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you it is easy to create a successfully engaging Facebook Fan Page. It is not.It&#8217;s not an insurmountable task either. But it requires planning, time, some kind of HTML knowledge, design skill, and imagination. Originality doesn&#8217;t hurt either.There are great tools and tips available that will help you create an outstanding page for your brand without an immense amount of time or capital invested. I&#8217;ve been working to improve our own Go2web20 fan page and I have some tips from my experience that I&#8217;m more than happy to share.Let me start off by saying, Facebook itself is the only true obstacle in the whole page creation process. If they accepted all code formats, it would be much easier to create any page. It would open up the space to immeasurable possibilities and we would see a wider variety of amazing, unique pages. But unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t the case so you have to find ways to work with what you&#8217;ve got and then take it up from there.Fan Page Profile PicturesYou might not know this but you can use a picture for your profile page as large as 200 x 600 pixels. The good thing about this is a larger picture offers better visibility of the campaign itself, which may include your company logo or a promotional banner of any kind. The downside to this eye-catching stunner is that it shifts the focus away from the rest of the page. This is why you need to plan your page first. Decide where you want the eyes of your visitors to go: on your image or on the rest of the page&#8217;s elements. You can play and preview your ideas, change them back and forth, and see what&#8217;s ultimately best for goals, your page, and its users.Example:Diverse TabsFacebook allows you to change the traditional boring tabs to be more exciting, original, and relevant.If you want to change your page&#8217;s tabs, you will first need to add this FBML application to your page. Then, go to your page manager, find the FBML tab, and click &#8216;edit&#8217;. Within the box that opens, you will be able to change the tab name, and add HTML code. What I&#8217;d suggest that you do is to first create a main landing tab that will welcome visitors to your page.Here&#8217;s what I did:I gave the tab a name &#8211; Go2web20Took a screenshot of my webpage and uploaded it to Flickr (optional)Grabbed the screenshot picture code from Flickr and inserted it in the FBML body box (FYI: I slightly edited the code, changed link destination to lead to our site, instead of the Flickr page.)I linked to my Website on this page since this is a big part of a fan page concept &#8211; to offer Facebook users access to my site in a new way.Finally, I added the Facebook comments box to enable people to leave comments in regards our website. The fb comment code can be found at this wiki page in the examples section (thanks for the tip @eyalshahar). Again, all I did was to customize it slightly with the relevant information of our site. In my opinion a huge value add in terms of engaging my users and inviting conversations to happen here.Page Dashboard:Landing Page:Now, since this is the tab you want new visitors to see and experience first, you need to set it this way on your admin page. Go to your page and click on &#8216;Edit Page&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Wall Settings&#8217; &gt; then on &#8216;Default Landing Tab for Everyone Else&#8217; chose the tab which you want to present first when new users enter your Facebook page. People who are already fans of your page, will see the &#8216;wall&#8217; first when they enter the page. The whole point of this landing page is that you make a informational welcoming page for new visitors that is interesting enough to be an incentive to fan this page. In a sea of fan pages this is important in terms of standing out and being innovative.If you want you can also add even more FBML tabs, but keep in mind that overall, Facebook only allows you to display and offer up to six tabs maximum, including the first two that you can&#8217;t change. So make sure you chose your tabs wisely.If you don&#8217;t want to mess around with FBML tabs, here are some alternatives (you can also add them as extras):Twitter Tab &#8211; This application lets you bundle your &#8216;Twitter Updates Tab&#8217; into your own profile or Fan page. The process is pretty easy: just add the application and follow the instructions.This is the end result:Flickr Tab &#8211; Same application but for Flickr photos. I found it more relevant to put this tab on my personal Facebook profile, but it is really depends on your brand&#8217;s goals and needs.Example:Foursquare Tab &#8211; I actually really like this tab, despite the fact, that I&#8217;m a Gowalla girl myself&#8230;If you are creating a page for your company and want a Foursquare tab, here&#8217;s what you can do:Create a venue for your brand/company/HQs on the Foursquare website (if you haven&#8217;t done this already)Add this PlaceWidget application and follow the simple instructions.And, that&#8217;s it. You now have a new tab on your page, Foursquare, and everyone can see how popular your spot is and read the tips visitors have left, furthering user engagement in a new way and offering visitors a chance to appear on your Facebook page and add their own tips.Example:Spotlight the People on your TeamIf you go through all the trouble of creating your own brand page, make sure you spotlight your team&#8217;s players and say something about the people behind the curtain. It adds a personal touch to your page and builds a connection between fans and the people involved in the project. Again, with the help of the FBML tab, I&#8217;ve created a tab that tells more about my team at Go2web20 (it is was pretty easy since we&#8217;re just two people). But even if you have lots of people on your team, it is important to give some background about company management and staff accomplishments or to at least name one contact person that can be reached easily.Example:Participate on your stream &#8211; that&#8217;s the whole pointI have to admit that I&#8217;m not as active on my own Facebook fan page (insert shame here) as I should be. I blame both Facebook and myself. First, I take accountability for not checking the page as often as I should. But, I also blame Facebook for not providing the right tools to track comments and conversations on pages like the ones available for our own profiles. It is really up to you how often you check your fan page activity. But, don&#8217;t think you can now sit back and put your feet up. This is not one of those &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; scenarios. Don&#8217;t take it for granted that you have a page available. No matter how great you&#8217;ve made it, if you aren&#8217;t active, it defeats the whole purpose of having one. A fan page requires maintenance. You have to be there for your page visitors. You have to talk with your fans. You have to answer questions, absorb feedback, and overall, make the conversation flow with consistent fresh content.I really think Facebook never predicted the volume of pages people would create and the effect of these pages on businesses/brands. Obviously, Facebook isn&#8217;t currently providing the right type of support and tools for pages builders. Until Facebook reconciles these changes into their Facebook pages concept and tunes into the importance that pages have garnered over the last few months, we&#8217;ll end up with somewhat crappy looking pages that we&#8217;re creating with just about any and every tool we can muster up.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'For the past few years, being the &#8220;Twitter for FILL-IN-THE-BLANK&#8221; has been a popular trend among startups. Now, we&#8217;re starting to see a shift. Several new startups are launching as the &#8220;Foursquare for FILL-IN-THE-BLANK.&#8221; And big brands are actually starting to take notice.Miso is an iPhone app that incorporates the &#8220;check-in&#8221; idea with watching movies and television shows. So, for example, if you&#8217;re watching that NCAA Tournament this weekend, you can check-in to let your friends what you&#8217;re doing. You can then send these check-ins to Twitter, Facebook, or yes, Foursquare, checking you in there in the process (assuming you&#8217;ve also attached an actual location to your movie/TV show check-in).But plenty of other services now are predicated around the check-in idea. What makes Miso the Foursquare for entertainment viewing, is that you earn badges for your check-ins. The idea has already attracted the interest of big-time brands, such as MGM Studios, which decided to strike a deal with Miso for its new movie Hot Tub Time Machine.Miso has made a special badge for the movie that you&#8217;ll get if you check-in to the movie. This is similar to the deals Foursquare has been signing with big brands, such as Starbucks, which gives users a special barrista badge if they check-in at Starbucks.Currently, there is nothing special beyond the badge you get for checking-in at the movie, but eventually the plan is that these types of check-ins could unlock special content from films, for example. There could also be sweepstakes you could enter by checking-in.Other apps, such as Hot Potato, also incorporate the idea of checking-in to events rather than just places.Miso is the latest app by Bazaar Labs. Their first app, FlixUp!, a sort-of Rotten Tomatoes for movie talk on Twitter, launched at our Realtime Crunchup last Fall.You can find Miso in the App Store here. It&#8217;s a free download.CrunchBase Information',\n",

You can meet Brad, who joined AOL six months ago, at our upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York.Brad spoke about his product plans for AOL mail, saying that it&#8217;s time we reinvented the inbox to aggregate all of the different ways people communicate with each other online today. There hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been much innovation in e-mail in a long time. I mean, listen I&#8217;ll pick on a different competitor. You know, Gmail was profound when Gmail came out. Gmail hasnâ\\x80\\x99t done as much in the last 5 years. The interesting about this is there continues to be pain in the consumer experience, right? When you think about the inbox, it has proliferated and there are more and more inboxes in my life. Aggregation of social streams seems to be a big part of what his team is up to. AOL Lifestream, a new product that launched two weeks ago, is clearly part of this strategy:One of the things that I think is part of the change at AOL is an understanding and focus about what we are and what we are not. AOL isn&#8217;t confused about the idea, &#8216;hey, we&#8217;re trying to be a social network.&#8217; We&#8217;re not. Weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to create more social experiences by partnering with players who are very, very good at what they do. I don&#8217;t think all our competitors have gotten that same message that, hey there&#8217;s some very powerful and very good at what they do players, and I mean, particularly Facebook and I think we take a point of view as evidenced through AIM that, great. How do we partner with Facebook? How do we help Facebook? And how does that help AIM and how does that help the user? Lifestream clearly is another example of that.He also talks about the impact of relatively small changes &#8211; a removal of 65% of the ad units on the mail product, he says, resulted in higher new signups and user satisfaction.Brad also spoke about Yahoo and it&#8217;s chances for success (something I spoke with another former Yahoo exec, Caterina Fake, about recently). Specifically I asked him about Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz&#8217;s recent statement that AOL was little more than a &#8220;mini Yahoo.&#8221;Our exchange:Garlinghouse: When I hear Yahoo! saying that AOL is a mini Yahoo!, I kind of feel flattered that they are going to follow us in our strategy.Arrington: Carol Bartz called AOL a mini Yahoo! The first thing that pops in your head is &#8220;I&#8217;m flattered?&#8221; I thought we were going to cut all of the BS out of this interview with you. So I thought you were still a warrior saying, I&#8217;m sorry, no. We have a strategy, whatâ\\x80\\x99s Yahooâ\\x80\\x99s strategy? Garlinghouse: But I think, you know, you were seeing the world ask that question. That question has been asked for a long time at Yahoo! and it&#8217;s not clear to me. I was actually very hopeful when the search deal was announced. Arrington: Should it be clear? I mean, shouldn&#8217;t Yahoo! strategy be clear to the world? They&#8217;re a public company. Garlinghouse: It should be &#8211; maybe I&#8217;m not giving as much attention to Yahoo! these days. And later:Garlinghouse: If you step back, the 12 step process, first you must start by admitting you have a problem. And a lot of things should go from that. And I give the management team at Yahoo! credit for making some decisions they have. Obviously, they&#8217;ve sold HotJobs&#8230;[there continue to be] opportunities to focus on a handful areas that they want to be the best in the world, and that is, I think, directionally good.Arrington: What are those areas?Garlinghouse: I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s go ask Carol. The full transcript is below, care of PhoneTag:Mr. MICHAEL ARRINGTON: Hi, Brad Garlinghouse, the president of Consumer Applications at AOL. Hi, Brad.Mr. BRAD GARLINGHOUSE (President, Consumer Applications, AOL): Mike, how are you?Mr. ARRINGTON: Thanks for letting me come by your office. You&#8217;ve been here for 6 months now almost exactly. You started in September 2009. Wanted to ask you how things had gone over the last 6 months, looking forward a little bit just getting your things and other things going on in Silicon Valley. Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Fabulous.Mr. ARRINGTON: What is it that you own at AOL?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: So my responsibilities here are what we call the Consumer Applications Group. It&#8217;s a mixture of AOL&#8217;s mobile efforts, mail, AIM, and ICQ as well as the client bits if you will. That includes everything from our toolbar efforts as well as the traditional AOL client which has, you know, close to 10 million people still using AOL client, in the United States.Mr. ARRINGTON: So, there&#8217;s a big overlap from what you did at Yahoo and what you&#8217;re doing here at AOL. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s additional pieces you own here, mobile for example is one of those.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Right.Mr. ARRINGTON: But what have you done in the last 6 months? Some of these are housekeeping items. Some of these are brand new products including Lifestream which you released earlier this week.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yup.Mr. ARRINGTON: You told me, you know, what have you done so far and what the plan is for the future?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I realized, a couple quick highlight of thoughts. One of the things â\\x80\\x93 at the most macro level, I mean, AOL is changing. Itâ\\x80\\x99s changing dramatically and thatâ\\x80\\x99s likeâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Really or like, you know, you say that because thatâ\\x80\\x99s what you say?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: No.Mr. ARRINGTON: Because I hear the same thing from Yahoo which we will talk about maybe later. But, I mean, I think AOL is changing dramatically how. They got spin off whatâ\\x80\\x99s different, really like cutting through all the bullshit. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s different?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  I think at the end of the day when you completely change, you may ask your team, culture starts from the top and the culture here, I mean, you and I walkedâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON:  (unintelligible) management team has completely changed. Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  You and I walked around this office and I think, we both observed and agree that this is a very different place. It feels different. If you go to our offices in New York, it feels different, you know, you still haveâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: The morale is high, is what youâ\\x80\\x99re saying. I mean, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a real feeling here what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing is something important.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in AOL, I mean, youâ\\x80\\x99re too good at AOL but it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that feeling.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x93 I fundamentally believe that we can win as I fundamentally believe that we are better poised today and that they comfort at heart(ph) for taking risk for focusing on the consumer experience. And I think, you know, over time, AOL increasingly was focused on letâ\\x80\\x99s just do more to monetize, monetize, monetize. I donâ\\x80\\x99t have a history and understanding exactly other things came to pass, whether thereâ\\x80\\x99s Time Warner pressure or what have you, but you see a company stepping back, and you know, one of the things we did two months into my tenure is we did a refresh of AOL mail. We took 65% of the ads, the ad units in the AOL mail out. You know, that&#8217;s a big change, it impacts the user experience and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a commitment to the consumer experience, I think it has changed. And that&#8217;s a part of culture.Mr. ARRINGTON:  Have you been able to measure the impact of that since then?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: You absolutely can tell. And itâ\\x80\\x99s partly in just customer satisfaction. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s partly increased registrations. People are &#8211; you know, as people start to hear how AOL is changing and how the products are changing, they step back and they say how much of this is expected from AOL.Mr. ARRINGTON: How many people use AOL now?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I think, accounts grow, I&#8217;d say somewhere around 25 to 30 million, a number of 32 million accounts per se.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK so and what else should be done? What was that project hygiene we talked about that earlier?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Project hygiene, itâ\\x80\\x99s very much how do we clean up some of the basics of what we&#8217;re doing.Mr. ARRINGTON:  We also havenâ\\x80\\x99t been shy about integrating with other third party services like you integrated Facebook directly into AIMâ\\x80¦ Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yup.Mr. ARRINGTON:  â\\x80¦a month ago, a few weeks ago and then the Lifestream, which we wrote about is an aggregator and publisher to social networks. You see more of that?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: One of the things that I think is part of the change at AOL is an understanding and focus about what we are and what we are not. AOL isn&#8217;t confused about the idea, &#8216;hey, we&#8217;re trying to be a social network.&#8217; We&#8217;re not. Weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to create more social experiences by partnering with players who are very, very good at what they do. I don&#8217;t think all our competitors have gotten that same message that, hey there&#8217;s some very powerful and very good at what they do players, and I mean, particularly Facebook and I think we take a point of view as evidenced through AIM that, great. How do we partner with Facebook? How do we help Facebook? And how does that help AIM and how does that help the user? Lifestream clearly is another example of that. In analysis of Lifestream even more so is an example of us going from playing defense to other company to playing offense. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s part of that cultural shift where we want to innovate, we want to identify new segments that address core consumer pain. And I think, you know, you, I, we have a lot of touch points on the web and the online consumer experience is getting more confusing. Lifestream is the solution and takes away consumer paying and that category is going to continue to grow and I think we have a very â\\x80\\x93 the data, external data which suggest, we have by far the largest social aggregation play in the market today.Mr. ARRINGTON:  If you take away AOLâ\\x80\\x99s dialup business which is still, I think is decreasing a third a year but still 700 million dollar a year in free cash, right, or something like that. AOL isnâ\\x80\\x99t today a profitable entity. You talked about winning earlier. Is winning getting in the point where AOL is truly a profitable sustainable long term company or winning means something different to you and how do you get there without that dialup business which goes away?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: You know, depending upon which analyst reports you look at, some of that may not be exactly the same. That being said, you know, it&#8217;s veryâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: I thought you have great numbers on your laptop.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I think it&#8217;s very clear that we want to focus on building out a fabulous web service in the business and that is primarily an ad supported business. You know, that business today is â\\x80\\x93 you know, I don&#8217;t know what the analysts say in sizes, but itâ\\x80\\x99s &#8211; you know it&#8217;s quite large relative to most competitors and we are focused on growing that business. How do I focus on winning? I mean, look, you know me a little bit. I&#8217;m a very competitive person. I want to win. You know, in the immediate term, winning is probably measured by demonstrating to consumers and as well as Wall Street analysts that we are engaging users and getting them to come back and check out our services and have great experiences. That is what we talked about earlier. Lifestream is a great example of that. People theyâ\\x80\\x99re like, wow, I didn&#8217;t expect this from AOL.Mr. ARRINGTON: Let&#8217;s talk about the future. Specifically, what to expect out of your group over the next, say 12 months, things you have planned that youâ\\x80\\x99re willing to talk about in broad strokes.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Things that we should start getting excited about now.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: You know, the first broad highlight is, we are clearly re-investing in AOL mail andâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON:  How do you get excited about e-mail these days?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Actually, the reason why, there hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been much innovation in e-mail in a long time. I mean, listen I&#8217;ll pick on a different competitor. You know, Gmail was profound when Gmail came out. Gmail hasnâ\\x80\\x99t done as much in the last 5 years. The interesting about this is there continues to be pain in the consumer experience, right? When you think about the inbox, it has proliferated and there are more and more inboxes in my life. And that actually â\\x80\\x93 that consumer pain is you know not aâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Is the solution what Buzz has done with moving like the social stuff into the Gmail inbox because that seems to be a pain for people as well.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: You know, I donâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x93 I think Buzz is hard toâ\\x80¦I thinkâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: I noticed you didnâ\\x80\\x99t integrate Buzz into Lifestream.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: At its coreâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: I mean, you even integrated MySpace into Lifestream but not Google Buzz. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s such a recent product in regard toâ\\x80¦Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: At its core, e-mail is definitely I think, there remain opportunities to innovate around e-mail and if you could deliver about these experiencesâ\\x80¦ Mr. ARRINGTON: What&#8217;s an easy, easy big thing to do to fix my e-mail, to make it better, substantially better?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I do think that there are opportunities around inbox aggregation that have not been well executed more in the industryâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Aggregation of like Facebook inbox. What are other inboxes?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: How many inboxes do you have in your life? You know, you have Facebook inbox. You have a Linkedln inbox. You have a Twitter inbox.Mr. ARRINGTON: Text messaging.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: SMS, you know, these are still â\\x80\\x93 I mean granted that these are the things in the industry to talk about 15 or 20 years in unified messaging. And some intentionally not, like say, hey, we have a better unified messaging experience. My point is more to say when people talk about this, there&#8217;s a very funny Wall Street Journal article in the last six months. Well, since I&#8217;ve been here at AOL, talked about, you know that kind of the death of e-mail. You know, the rumor has since demised, have definitely been exaggerated. I think the most humorous part of that Wall Street Journal article is it concluded with one of the research reporters e-mailed her ad, you know. And it said that, you know, social networks have grown â\\x80\\x93 are now larger than e-mail. Every social network I know requires an e-mail used to log in. There is actually data amongst the people â\\x80\\x93 Nielsen did some very interesting research about the heaviest social networking users who are actually using e-mail more now in part because so much of the activity around social networks end up in your e-mail box.Mr. ARRINGTON: So do you think, by the end of this year, we are in 2010, you think by the end of this year, weâ\\x80\\x99ll see substantial products being released around mail that may convince people â\\x80\\x93 people like me to use AOL mail as their mail provider?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I thinkâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Was there another time frame to get there?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: No.Mr. ARRINGTON: First, let me â\\x80\\x93 before you had Oddpost, right? You bought Oddpost at Yahoo. It was such a game changer. Is there something when you acquire a bill that you think can be a game changer this year for AOL mail?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I think yes. I think that, Michael, this year for AOL mail, is for people to take another look. If the people come back and say, interesting, Iâ\\x80\\x99m impressed this is from AOL. We started to demonstrate some of that with the AIM Facebook announcement. We started demonstrating that with the Lifestream announcement and I think we can continue to do that, not just within mail but across a number of things weâ\\x80\\x99re delivering at AOL, mobile, the number of interesting things going on that I think, at the end of this year, if the world steps back and says, this management team â\\x80\\x93 this new management team actually is living up to its expectations, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be very happy.Mr. ARRINGTON: So, before you joined AOL, you were briefly at Silver Lake Partners?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: As a â\\x80\\x93 what were you? An adviser, we think youâ\\x80\\x99re joining full timeMr. GARLINGHOUSE:  I was technically called a senior adviser. You know, private equity firms don&#8217;t do EIR Programs per se with respect to EIR and Silver Lake at that time had not had as much depth in the internet space. I mean, obviously, they have a fabulous track record. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve done a little bit more in the internet space and certainly have been more interested in that space. So they brought in account people who were more from the web environment.Mr. ARRINGTON:  So, they were the big money in the Skype acquisition.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON:  Did you work on that deal at all? Were you looking at it?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Tangentially, you know, most of the stuff I was looking at was in the Silver Lake Sumeru Fund which is in the mid-market fund looking to spend 50 million to $150 million checks as part of the whole $1.2 billion fund. Silver Lake Partners is a larger fund that actually did as kind of semantics in details but they did the big check and it&#8217;s, I think, a $9 billion fund. But obviously, it was a resource working at Silver Lake Partners as well as the market fund.Mr. ARRINGTON:  So before that, you were at Yahoo. Right (unintelligible) you left Yahoo in the middle of 2008.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Actually, now (unintelligible) departure in the middle of 2008 stuck around for a while helping the transition items but then left Yahoo and joined Silver Lake.Mr. ARRINGTON:  And so at Yahoo, you were head of â\\x80\\x93 what was it called? Your Mail Flickr, Mash and Yahoo Instant Messenger.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON:  What else? What was it called?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  The group for different incarnations was CCF, Communications Community Front Doors. Then it evolved where Front Doors which is the homepage, My Yahoo came out and then it (unintelligible) ran that group very effectively. But that was a core Flickr Mail Messengerâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON:  Mashâ\\x80¦Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Exactly.Mr. ARRINGTON:  That the social network with Darth Vader and a banana, with a guitar.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. The idea behind Mash which, you know, I thinkâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Have to take a look at it.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Actually, the idea behind Mash I think is very interesting. It&#8217;s really the wikification(ph) of people&#8217;s profiles because even now for me to go and just plain(ph) edit other people&#8217;s stuff, you can&#8217;t really do. I think you can make a richer experience make other people- particularly trusted people participate in it.Mr. ARRINGTON: Maybe we can schedule additional times so we can go to more detail of Mash. Let&#8217;s talk about some of the other things beside Mash that you accomplished at Yahoo! So you joined Yahoo, when? You were there before three years.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE:  Early March of 2003.Mr. ARRINGTON: So at that time, mail was your huge product, Mail Messenger, right? Yahoo! Mail was, you know, number three player, number four player and you knew(ph) about Oddpost. Tell me a little bit of like the first steps you took there to sort of make Yahoo the number one player in mail.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it&#8217;s actually I think it wasn&#8217;t that long. Well actually, people forget like how much has changed in the e-mail space these years. Really, the first thing we focused on was anti-spam. In 2003, there you know, Bill Gates came out and said, heâ\\x80\\x99s going to solve spam and there&#8217;s a ton &#8211; it was increasingly a huge problem that the industry has gotten more of their arms around. So we were better than our competitors at that time. It was usually Hotmail and AOL and we clearly had gotten a better handle on anti-spam and we did a lot from a marketing point as to take advantage of that. We bought Oddpost in the spring of 2004 which really, for my part it was the best deal that I was involved with during my Yahoo tenure. And it was, I think a mixture of the right people there, the right technology bed and that really became the foundation for the all new Yahoo! Mail, internally at that time we called Candygram andâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: It was the first mail application online that worked sort of like a desktop application.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Job descriptor way before â\\x80\\x93 that gave Web 2.0 and all these new start ups came out.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: And it was a really nice sort of interface.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: People loved. They continue to use. Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: It was incredibly well done and Iâ\\x80¦ Mr. ARRINGTON: Itâ\\x80\\x99s (unintelligible) help how to grow.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Well, it really differentiates us in a pretty commoditized market. It puts Yahoo! Mail as doing interesting different innovative stuff and you know. The number one reason why even today people adopt various e-mail products is based on word of mouth their friends recommend. And when you get people coming in, trying a product and service they like, wow, that&#8217;s great. They tell their friends about it. And started to see increasingly a nice trajectory as people band and other players join us at Yahoo at that time. Mr. ARRINGTON: You can later write me a note, unlimited storage. Tell me about the storage at Yahoo! Mail. Was that unlimited orâ\\x80¦Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: It actually is an interesting- I mean, I will admit strictly now this is, you know, a couple handful of years later. Gmail launched, I think, around April 1, 2004, and you know, not surprisingly, internally at Yahoo!, you know, it got a lot, a lot, a lot of attention. And I give the team at Yahoo! a ton of credit for reacting very quickly and change the dynamics as could as we could for our users and you know, it&#8217;s easy to launch the gigabyte storage when you donâ\\x80\\x99t have users. It&#8217;s harder when you already have tens and millions of users to just line up a gig of storage.Mr. ARRINGTON: And thatâ\\x80\\x99s when you move on unlimited storage?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: It took us about, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, a year. We mainly moved to a hundred megs, we went to 250, we went to a gig. Within a year, we went to unlimited storage and we were just like, weâ\\x80\\x99re taking this off the table. And, you know, it is again, it&#8217;s unbelievable to really sit back and I think six years ago when you got a Hotmail account, you got two megabytes of storage for free. When you got Yahoo! account, you have four megabytes of storage for free.Mr. ARRINGTON: So much spam. Can&#8217;t store much spam in four megabytes. Three weeks ago, two weeks ago, Carol Bartz defined Yahoo!, sorry to find AOL as a mini Yahoo! Is she right?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: You know, if you step back and left the industry, I think this is true broadly. I thought a million to believe the first step to solving a problem is admitting you have a problemâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yahoo! admitted they have a problem? Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: One of the things that is very clear at AOL is there&#8217;s no confusion with the management team that we have challenges and we have identified those and we have been very aggressive about calling them out and working to fix them. I don&#8217;t see our competitors universally- yeah, I think some of them have said that, you know, the language I hear is that yes, there are problems but I don&#8217;t see the actions demonstrating that in fact, here is how we are getting better as a company. You know, I guess, Yahoo! is a very, very strong company. And they make a lot of money. And I guess Carol- you know, I think AOL has been very aggressive about defining a very clear strategy of where we&#8217;re going. When I hear Yahoo! saying that AOL is a mini Yahoo!, I cannot feel flattered that they are going to follow us in our strategy. Mr. ARRINGTON: Oh, come on.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I think there&#8217;s no question if you look backâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Carol Bartz called AOL a mini Yahoo! The first thing that pops in your head, I&#8217;m flattered. I thought we were going to cut all of the BS out of this interview with you. So I think we&#8217;re still warriors saying, I&#8217;m sorry, no. Like, we have a strategy, whatâ\\x80\\x99s Yahooâ\\x80\\x99s strategy? Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: But I think, you know, you were seeing the world ask that question. That question has been asked for a long time at Yahoo! and I think that is still &#8211; and it&#8217;s not clear to me. I was actually very helpful when the search deal was announced. Mr. ARRINGTON: Should it be clear? I mean, shouldn&#8217;t Yahoo! strategy be clear to the world? They&#8217;re a private company. Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: It should be &#8211; maybe I&#8217;m not giving as much attention to Yahoo! these days. Mr. ARRINGTON: I do. I don&#8217;t know what it is that there- you know, search (unintelligible). I&#8217;ll do that â\\x80\\x93 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll set my rant for the post but I think as an ex-senior executive at Yahoo!, you have some idea of what it is their strategy is.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yahoo! was a fabulous experience for me. I totally enjoyed my experience there. I also made a decision to leave based on lots and lots of factors. I fundamentallyâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: What&#8217;s the number one factor?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I fundamentally believe that in a company like AOL, that&#8217;s more willing to take risks and more willing to say, we&#8217;re going to be aggressive in some areas, it&#8217;s very difficult. There&#8217;s a classic innovatorâ\\x80\\x99s dilemmaâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Is that when it comes down to you as AOL is clearly taking a risk? I think everyone would agree. AOL exceed with all the staff, that you&#8217;re hiring a thousand journalists on the other side of business that worked New York, the stuff that you&#8217;re doing out here in California although I think youâ\\x80\\x99re also bi-coastal. Clearly risk had been taken here.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Risk is a- as far as I can tell, Yahoo! is taking less and less risk overtime. Is that really the fundamental difference you think?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: Well, I admit Iâ\\x80\\x99m not day-to-day involved with Yahoo! at this point. So I don&#8217;t claim to haveâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Interesting enough (unintelligible) search theyâ\\x80\\x99ve hedged with Facebook complaining (unintelligible) finding pointing to a little more detail here than we have to in Yahoo! but I don&#8217;t see whether there really, like the big answer being placed, if any.Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: The question was actually, I think, if you step back, the 12 step process, first you must start by admitting you have a problem. And a lot of things should go from that. And I give the management team at Yahoo! credit for making some decisions they have. Obviously, they&#8217;ve solved HotJobs, something else, they solved, I can&#8217;t remember right now. You know, and there are, I think, continue the opportunities to focus on a handful areas that they want to be the best in the world, and that is, I think, directionally good.MR. ARRINGTON: What are those areas?Mr. GARLINGHOUSE: I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s go ask Carol. CrunchBase Information\",\n",

Now we&#8217;ve heard from multiple sources about a third major product the company plans to unveil: a persistent Facebook toolbar that third-party sites can integrate that sounds a whole lot like the Meebo Bar.Details on Facebook&#8217;s toolbar are still scant, but we hear that it will rest at the bottom of the browser window using AJAXy technology, the way Meebo&#8217;s Bar does (and the way the chat bar previously integrated into Facebook.com did before it).  We can expect the Facebook bar to include sharing features and chat, just like the Meebo Bar. It&#8217;s unclear if Facebook will be launching its bar with advertising but we can almost certainly expect it to come eventually.These three new features â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0a webwide Like button, auto-Connect, and a persistent toolbar â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0make it abundantly clear that Facebook is looking to extend its reach to as much of the web as possible, and it won&#8217;t be an opt-in experience.

But Foursquare has an actual way to do that: take down the entire service.Yesterday, Foursquare had some downtime. That&#8217;s nothing new, startups have downtime all the time â\\x80\\x94 see: Twitter, that was their M.O. for about a year â\\x80\\x94 but the reason for Foursquare&#8217;s appears to be a little humorous.While the site is back up and running now, it appears that Foursquare forgot to renew their domain name, which expired on March 25. As a result, GoDaddy, the registrar, pulled the site and put up their own landing page. Which some people noticed on Twitter and other tipped us about.Luckily for Foursquare, registrars like GoDaddy tend to give you several notices before they pull down your domain and actually put it back up for sale. It looks like Foursquare was able to grab it quickly and get it back up there. Still, this seems like a rather large oversight from a company supposedly raising a new $10 million round of funding that would put its valuation near $80 million on paper.Let&#8217;s hope some of that money goes toward a new position: master of the domain.Interestingly, after its first round of funding, the first thing Foursquare did was purchase the foursquare.com domain. Previously, the service was found at playfoursquare.com. So what happened here is probably that the team forgot to change the email notifications from whoever owned the domain originally to one of their email addresses. At least, I hope that&#8217;s what happened.Also worth noting: co-founder Dennis Crowley originally wanted to name his first startup Foursquare, but couldn&#8217;t obtain the domain, so he went with Dodgeball instead (which later sold to Google). You&#8217;d think that Crowley would at least cherish the domain a bit more.[thanks TJ]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday, Facebook released a proposed privacy policy that foreshadowed a bold (and creepy) new feature: some third-party partners are going to be allowed to access and use your Facebook data without any prior consent.  Make no mistakeÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0there will be backlash. That&#8217;s par for the course for Facebook, which has shown time and time again that it isn&#8217;t afraid of a little bad press. But this time could be different: Facebook users may not only object to having their social graphs shared without their permission, they could also finally get a  wakeup call as to what the site&#8217;s infamous &#8216;Everyone&#8217; setting really means, as well some of the other unsettling privacy changes Facebook made last December. And things could get ugly.Imagine what will happen the first time Joe Facebooker visits a third-party site he&#8217;s never been to and is greeted by the smiling faces of his friends, his most recent shared updates, and content tailored to his gender, location, and age. There&#8217;s a decent chance he&#8217;s going to assume something has gone terribly, terribly wrongÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0maybe he&#8217;s been hacked or phished. Or maybe he&#8217;ll realize that the privacy wizard he went through last December wasn&#8217;t as benign as he thought.For those that haven&#8217;t been keeping score, Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;Everyone&#8217; setting lets users share their content with the entire Internet, which includes search engines and (apparently) third-party sites. It was originally released last June, when it was buried deep in Facebook&#8217;s labyrinthine settings, but it wasn&#8217;t until December that it was used on a wide scale. The reason for the mass migration toward sharing data with Everyone instead of with just your friends on Facebook? As part of an ostensibly easier-to-use privacy overhaul, Facebook decided to make it the default setting. As part of that same overhaul, Facebook also decided to make data like your friends list, gender, and current cityÂ\\xa0publiclyÂ\\xa0available when it previously wasn&#8217;t.Press, bloggers, and numerous privacy organizations attacked the Trojan horse of a launch as soon as it happened, contending that users were not being properly informed about what this new Everyone option entailed. Facebook&#8217;s PR team battled back by saying 35% of users had made changes to their privacy settings during the process, which supposedly implied that they knew what they were doing. A few weeks later, the uproar had dissipated.Which brings us to today. I&#8217;m still firmly of the opinion that the vast majority of Facebook users do not fully understand their privacy settings, nor do they grasp what &#8220;Everyone&#8221; means in this context.  Facebook may have gotten users&#8217; consent, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t informed consent.  Microsoft researcher Danah Boyd, who studies this sort of thing for a living, has come to the same conclusion: during her keynote at SXSW, Boyd revealed that she&#8217;s been asking &#8220;non-techie&#8221; users what they thought their privacy settings were, and then walked them through what they actually were on the site. Not once have the settings matched the user&#8217;s expectations.So why haven&#8217;t Facebook users started unleashing a Beaconesque wave of fury over this? There&#8217;s a good chance that they simply have no idea that there&#8217;s been a significant change. From a functionality perspective, the Everyone setting changed almost nothing â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it&#8217;s easier to find content in Facebook Search, and now some of the data is being shared with Google and Bing, but that&#8217;s about it. Likewise, the expanded definition of &#8220;General Information&#8221;, which now includes your social graph, hasn&#8217;t had much impact yet either.That&#8217;s going to change with this forthcoming version of Facebook Connect â\\x80\\x94 or whatever Facebook plans to call it â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0which will apparently give &#8220;trusted&#8221; partners access to your data as soon as you visit them, whether or not you opted-in to share it.  Facebook will be sharing what it calls &#8220;General Information&#8221;, which includes profile photos, your gender, social graph, and â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you guessed it â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0anything you&#8217;ve ever shared using that Everyone option. Facebook hasn&#8217;t outlined exactly how it will work, but a spokesman told ReadWriteWeb the following:&#8220;The right way to think about this is not like a new experience but as making the [Facebook] Connect experience even better and more seamless&#8230; People love personalized and social experiences and that&#8217;s why Facebook and Facebook Connect have been so successful. We think there are some instances where people would benefit from this experience as soon as they arrive on a small number of trusted websites that we pre-approve.&#8221;Facebook is hoping, of course, that users will embrace this â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0they&#8217;ll effectively have a personalized Internet experience that automatically draws from their social graph and demographic information, like age, sex, and location. It could make the web at large smarter and more social, which is actually a pretty exciting idea. Thing is, Facebook is shoving that dream down its users&#8217; throats, and it&#8217;s the one deciding which sites are trustworthy enough to swap your data with.If the inevitable backlash does lead to users raging against the Everyone setting, that could have a major impact on Facebook&#8217;s future. For over a year now, the site has been gradually evolving to leverage its data beyond Facebook proper so that it could better compete against Twitter and Google. This, in some senses, will be the moment of truth â\\x80\\x94 will users be okay with sharing their data beyond Facebook&#8217;s walled garden, or will they feel like they&#8217;ve been duped?CrunchBase Information',\n",

Type &#8220;iThing&#8221; or &#8220;iStuff&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find that there are no shortcuts to product or related pages &#8211; evidently because there are no Apple products called iThing or iStuff to find on the website. Now, run a search for the term &#8220;iSlate&#8221;. Interesting, isn&#8217;t it?At the end of last year, MacRumors discovered that Apple once owned &#8211; and likely still owns -the domain name islate.com, after which we ran a search for U.S. and European trademarks related to the term. Applications for the marks existed indeed, only they were filed by a company called Slate Computing, more than likely a shell entity set up by Cupertino in order to hide the associated documents from public sight.Later, MacRumors found that Slate Computing also applied for a trademark for &#8220;Magic Slate&#8221;, further fueling rumors that Apple&#8217;s tablet device &#8211; which was still unannounced, unconfirmed and thus unnamed at that point &#8211; would be given the name iSlate. Apple CEO Steve Jobs went on to unveil the device in January 2010, named it iPad, and everyone sort of forgot about those other trademarks. This morning, we took another look at them.On the 24th of February 2010, Apple&#8217;s Senior Trademark Specialist, Regina Porter, signed off on a 6-month extension request for the &#8220;iSlate&#8221; trademark application. The applicant (Slate Computing) in the extension request says it maintains a &#8220;continued bona fide intention to use or use through the applicant&#8217;s related company or licensee the mark in commerce&#8221; in the United States and highlights ongoing efforts in &#8220;product or service research or development&#8221;. It was the third time Apple (sorry, Slate Computing) requested this Request for Extension of Time to File a Statement of Use, and it was approved by the USPTO on March 26.So far, so interesting. But there&#8217;s more.Slate Computing originally filed a trademark application for &#8220;Magic Slate&#8221; back in June 2009, and apparently amended it to more accurately describe the products and services associated with the name less than two weeks ago (March 15). I&#8217;d cut and paste the amended description in full, but it is so broad that it would take a huge amount of space. If you want the full details, go here and click &#8216;Response to Office Action&#8217;. Again, the applicant contends to have a &#8220;bona fide intention to use or use through the applicant&#8217;s related company or licensee the mark in commerce&#8221; and this time the company also asserts a claim of priority based on the fact that it has successfully registered &#8216;Magic Slate&#8217; as a trademark in the EU. Sure enough, the European community trademark for &#8216;Magic Slate&#8217; was approved and published at the beginning of this month (1 March).In conclusion: Apple is holding on to those iSlate and Magic Slate trademarks real tight, and I think it&#8217;s safe to assume we&#8217;ll be seeing new products or services by those names at some point. Could iSlate be the name of that larger Mac OSX powered tablet we&#8217;ve been hearing rumors about? Is the Magic Slate the name of a nifty touch-screen peripheral currently in the works?Update: commenter Ryan Wood suggests that maybe &#8216;iSlate&#8217; would be an alternative name for Apple to use in case Fujitsu did not hand over its &#8216;iPad&#8217; trademark (which it actually did about 10 days ago). Definitely a possibility.Your guess is as a good as mine, but I have a feeling there might be some surprises at the next WWDC (which will likely be held in June/July 2010).CrunchBase Information',\n",

In this guest post, Gabe Zichermann argues that fun is good and that game mechanics will find their way into all sorts of products and businesses.  Zichermann is the CEO of professional mobile social networking startup beamME and the co-author of the upcoming books &#8220;Game-Based Marketing&#8221; and â\\x80\\x9cFunware in Action.â\\x80\\x9dWhat if everything we did was a little more fun?Ever since Foursquare burst onto the scene with its clever badges and simplified â\\x80\\x9cmayoralâ\\x80\\x9d achievements, people have been going gaga for game mechanics (and Gaga videos, circumstantially). Its competitors and allies, from Gowalla and Yelp to Miso, Hot Potato and my own startup, beamME, have been evangelizing the value of points, badges, levels, challenges, leaderboards and achievements as an easy and powerful way to get consumers to engage with a product or service.This use of game mechanics outside of gamesâ\\x80\\x94also known as Funwareâ\\x80\\x94is taking the social web and mobile apps world by storm. Almost every aspiring startupâ\\x80\\x94and many established brands, including Chase, NBC and the US Armyâ\\x80\\x94are turning to Funware to deliver results that traditional/social marketing simply cannot deliver. As I explain in my new book, Game-Based Marketing, game mechanics can make any service or community more fun; and when given a choice between two similar activities, consumers will always choose the one thatâ\\x80\\x99s more enjoyable.Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you?Within the next 10 years, almost every consumer interaction will have game mechanics built into it. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll earn points for filing your taxes early, virtual badges for doing public service, and there will even be game shows on TV offering purely virtual rewards.  Yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m officially predicting â\\x80\\x9cAre You Smarter Than a 5th Grade Farmville Player?â\\x80\\x9d (Coming Fall 2015 on NBC)But the use of game mechanics isnâ\\x80\\x99t limited to things that already seem somewhat enjoyable. Â\\xa0I always get asked the same question about how to apply game mechanics to specific, challenging product categoriesâ\\x80\\x94and even how to make great products better.So in the spirit of fun, hereâ\\x80\\x99s my wishlist for the top three web/mobile apps Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to see â\\x80\\x9cgameifiedâ\\x80\\x9d, and the three major game mechanics they should use: Leaderboards, Points and Status.Facebook.  Yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most popular social network, and perhaps the most trafficked website in the U.S., but it still could be a lot more fun.Letâ\\x80\\x99s take your â\\x80\\x9cfriend scoreâ\\x80\\x9d, for example.  Most of us know exactly how many friends we have, and are keeping a running tally of our friends who have an outrageous number of connections and those who barely socialize on the site at all. (Facebook says the average user has about 200 friends). In effect, we are keeping a running leaderboard in our minds of how our social graph ranks by popularity. But why not make the leaderboard public? Consider that Orkut exists almost entirely because of this incidental feature (the country-by-country leaderboard is what made nationalistic Brazilians sign up by the millions to â\\x80\\x9cbeatâ\\x80\\x9d the US).A socialized leaderboard would allow you to more easily gauge the popularity of your social graph and give you an incentive to make/add more connections to the service. Maybe the score could be weighted to reward adding friends ho are more active on the site, or who in turn have more connections than others. Â\\xa0A well-designed board would also let you see your relative and absolute ranking, along with a simple invitation to do just a little better (â\\x80\\x9cadd two more friends to beat Samâ\\x80\\x99s scoreâ\\x80\\x9d).  It could even be designed to reward you for having more friends you actually interact with by scoring your behavior.Generating that kind of behavior would be a huge win-win. Having more friends generally equates to greater personal satisfaction with Facebook and in real life, while Facebook has frequently called the number of connections the most important driver of user growth and engagement. All this is possible through the simple power of the leaderboard and would further cement Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s intrinsic potential for fun.Fedex. With the rise of e-commerce and simplified logistics, merchants and consumers are ever more acquainted with how to ship packages across the country and the world. After all, simplifying shipping (with things like the Free Super Saver at Amazon) has been credited as one of the most important drivers of e-commerce growth. But why canâ\\x80\\x99t the experience of shipping (or receiving packages) be made more fun and social?What if Fedex allowed you to connect your social graph to your shipments, letting you see your en route packages on a game board relative to your friends? You would receive points and rankings for various shipping stats, such as total time in transit, miles traveled per day, and so on. You could â\\x80\\x9ctalk smackâ\\x80\\x9d to friends whose packages were sent via ground (or the USPS), and even choose to use points to speed up shipments already underway. You could even design it to reward â\\x80\\x9cgreenâ\\x80\\x9d choices as a second level of interaction. In short, the game would have a built-in incentive to get users to choose faster shipment methods and to publicize their choice of carrier.If they wanted to kick it up a notch, they could even incorporate tracking stream data from competitive carriers (look at how much slower UPS is!) and let consumers use the power of human intelligence to do warehouse-to-destination routing calculus, a super complex math problem that could be easily made into a fun game. Suddenly, shipping isnâ\\x80\\x99t just a commodity â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s enjoyable â\\x80\\x93 and itâ\\x80\\x99s entirely possible with points.Amazon.com book reviews. Paul Carr recently wrote an impassioned essay  about the failure of Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s book reviews to adjust for consumer vigilantism. While the comments were interesting and the suggestions lucid, making Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s (or Yelpâ\\x80\\x99s, or TripAdvisorâ\\x80\\x99s) product and service reviews more accurate and relevant can be better accomplished through the thoughtful application of Funware, rather than one-off rulemaking.In fact, Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s review scheme was one of the first highly successful reputation systems, using basic badge mechanics and â\\x80\\x9cflaggingâ\\x80\\x9d to encourage and reward thorough reviews. Despite its early lead however, the review system on the site has stagnated in the last few years, with irrelevant badges becoming the norm (â\\x80\\x9cTop 500 Reviewerâ\\x80\\x9d) and no true connection to a social graph.By taking a page from Farmville and other Facebook games, Amazon could reignite the fun of writing reviews on the site and go a long way toward eliminating the chaff that clogs up the works. The key is to associate the reviews with the social graph in a way that both friends and prospective buyers can see.Iâ\\x80\\x99d start by creating a virtual bookshelf for every book purchased â\\x80\\x93 whether on Kindle or in the real world â\\x80\\x93 allowing people to connect that to Facebook and curate the contents. Now take a page out of Blippy and Farmville and post this every time a purchase is made:Gabe just purchased Game-Based Marketing on Amazon.com, check out his bookshelf.This will drive friends to visit Gabeâ\\x80\\x99s virtual bookshelf giving Amazon a fun way to socialize book (or other product) buying, but also ensuring that the original buyersâ\\x80\\x99 friends are reading their reviews (which rarely happens today). Then, issue visual, socialized badges for buying, reading, reviewing and evangelism behaviors so that usersâ\\x80\\x99 status is directly connected to the books they have on their virtual shelves and what they say about them.Since we also know that badges are highly effective at creating positive status loops and desirable behaviors, Amazon could easily issue badges for a wide range of reading activities. Whether its Science Fiction book discovery or reading 20% of the available bestsellers on Barack Obama, given the scope of literature, there are a virtually unlimited number of badges that could be earned!Now, allow random buyers to browse Gabeâ\\x80\\x99s virtual bookshelf (or virtual living-room, kitchen, garden) directly from the productâ\\x80\\x99s page on Amazon. This will facilitate better reviewer/buyer understanding (my biggest personal complaint about reviews is that I canâ\\x80\\x99t judge the reviewers taste against my own) and keep reviewers more honest because their real social graph is connected to the books they choose to keep/curate.In short, Amazon could make book discovery, purchase and review a lot more fun by using socially publicized selections and badges to their advantage.Whether itâ\\x80\\x99s Facebook, Fedex, Amazon or your own startup, Funware and game mechanics can have a profound impact on how customers interact with each other and with your products. Incorporating points, badges, levels, challenges, leaderboards and achievements is a straightforward way to drive consumer engagement, even when the underlying activity isnâ\\x80\\x99t intrinsically enjoyable.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a lesson weâ\\x80\\x99ve learned time and time againâ\\x80\\x94if a game mechanic is good enough, users wonâ\\x80\\x99t care if the theme is banal (Farmville) or the activity repetitive (Foursquare); all they care about are the virtual rewards for a virtual job well done.In our fun future, weâ\\x80\\x99ll earn these virtual, social rewards for everything we doâ\\x80\\x94from shipping packages to taking out our trash, from getting good grades to buying books.  If the rapid success of early Funware apps are any indication, perhaps a more playful world is closer than we think.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday, Google product manager James Kelly posted a blog post stating that 600 communities applied to be a guinea pig for the search giants experimental fiber network. And 190,000 individuals wrote letters of support for their communities to be chosen. But the post was written with 5 hours until the deadline, so it was expected that more cities would apply to be chosen by the end of the day on Friday. Yesterday night, Kelly updated the post with the final tally: 1100 communities submitted applications, and 194,000 individuals posted letters of support for their communities. Google also posted a map showing the locations of the applications and letters of support. Each small dot represents a government response, and each large dot represents locations where more than 1,000 residents submitted a nomination. It appears that applications centralized around both coasts, with a few of the central areas of the U.S. noticeably lacking in participation. We wrote about the great lengths many cities and towns were taking to catch the attention of Google, in the hope that the search giant would choose their community for its fiber network. The broadband network would be completely free for the chosen city (only the consumers using the services will be charged) and the 1Gb/sec fiber would be roughly 100 times faster than what most Americans get today for Internet speeds. Google&#8217;s plan is to reach anywhere from 50,000 to 500,000 people with this experiment. In terms of the application process, Google asked that interested municipalities fill out a Request for Information (RFI) to help determine the best community for the experiment. Google estimated that each form/request from cities would take around 4 hours to complete. Individuals and citizens can also submit letters of support for cities.  The next step, says Google, is to review all of the city applications and individual letters of support, perform site visits, consult with third-party organizations as well has communicate with local officials in cities of interest. A final city/town is expected to be announced by the end of the year. Google&#8217;s broadband plan is designed to compliment the U.S. government&#8217;s ten year broadband plan, which among other goals, wants to subsidize broadband connections in rural areas, and bring 1-gigabit connections to every community in the U.S. But there are a number of flaws with the government&#8217;s strategy, namely that the plans aren&#8217;t ambitious enough. For example, under the new plan, some 85% of homes covered would have no choice when it comes to a provider, possibly locking users into higher prices because of a lack of competition.So at then end of the day, Google represents a small beacon of hope in that it could provide a concrete example for other communities or broadband providers to follow. And while Google&#8217;s initial plan involves a fiber network at a very, very small scale, if all goes well, Google could end up expanding the project nationally.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Ask any old-time IBMer, and you will hear stories of IBMâ\\x80\\x99s legendary workforce-development practices. When a manager identified a manufacturing worker with promise, the company would teach him how to dress, how to speak to clients, and how to service products. These technicians would then be trained to be computer programmers, sales reps, or product managers. IBM president Thomas Watson, Sr., considered education so important that, in 1932, he started a mini-university for employees, the Endicott schoolhouse.That was until the â\\x80\\x9970s. IBM still provides good training, but try getting a job there today: unless you have just the right skills, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t even score an interview. New recruits donâ\\x80\\x99t receive the year or so of training that was common; they get a few days of orientation, after which theyâ\\x80\\x99re expected to be productive. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the same at Microsoft, Google, Apple, and almost every tech company. Unless you have the alphabet soup of technologies on your resume, youâ\\x80\\x99ll get nothing more than an auto-response to your job application. If you do get hired, itâ\\x80\\x99s up to you to stay current or get booted out with the first dip in sales. American corporations consider their workforce to be disposable â\\x80\\x94 like ball-point pens and cigarette lighters. Gone are the days when a company would train a factory worker to become a computer programmer or offer lifelong employment. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all about quarterly revenue and profits now.Large corporations do offer some employee training programs, but managers often discourage their workers from participating in them. Why invest in workers when there is no clear payback? After all, training requires time off, and costs the department money. And bosses fear that once their subordinates gain new skills, they will be more likely to jump ship â\\x80\\x94 to a better-paying competitor. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the common belief.But as lessons from the unlikeliest of places show, these assumptions are wrong. Workforce education increases productivity, decreases turnover, and leads to greater corporate growth. I was myself surprised to see this correlation when I researched the secrets of the success of Indian industry.Industry pundits often tout Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s engineering-graduation rates as Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s advantage. As far back as 2002, â\\x80\\x9cexpertsâ\\x80\\x9d claimed that India graduates 350,000 engineers every year. The reality is that India has a weak education system and produces far fewer engineers than is commonly believed. In 2002, it graduated 102,000 engineers. By 2006, this number had increased to 222,000 (and will be double that again, by 2011). India does have some excellent engineering schools, but at best, only half of the output of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s engineering colleges are employable upon graduation. Yet in 2007, Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s five largest IT services companies added 120,000 engineering jobs. IBM and Accenture added 14,000 engineers each in India in the same year. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only seven of the hundreds of companies that hired engineers that year. Where did these engineers come from, and how is it that Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s R&amp;D industry is booming?My team made several trips to India during 2007 and 2008 and met the executives of dozens of leading companies to solve this puzzle. We also interviewed workers in R&amp;D labs and reviewed the types of work they were doing. We were astonished at what we learned. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll explain.During the 1960s and 1970s, the Japanese achieved major advances in manufacturing management, which led to their rise as an economic power. The Japanese economic miracle and the countryâ\\x80\\x99s new manufacturing skills and methods surprised western firms; but the Japanese had done this by studying, adopting, and eventually perfecting the best practices of the West itself.My research team (at Harvard and Duke) found that India is achieving similar feats in workforce development by learning from the best practices of the western companies that have outsourced their computer systems and call centers there. It has adopted these practices and perfected them. Faced with severe talent shortages; escalating salaries; and a lagging education system, Indian industry had to adapt and has built innovative and comprehensive approaches to workforce training and management. Their initial focus was on training new recruits and filling entry-level skill gaps. Now, they are investing in constantly improving the skills and management abilities of their workers and in providing incentives for them to stay and to grow with the company.We published a report titled â\\x80\\x9cHow the Disciple Became the Guruâ\\x80\\x9d, which details the workforce-development practices of 24 leading companies in India (note: there are many bodyshops in India that don&#8217;t invest in their people, we looked at the biggest companies). I suggest you download and read this, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll present some highlights here of what the best Indian companies are doing right.Recruitment: When youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for a job, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the first thing you do? Create a good rÃ©sumÃ©. What does a good rÃ©sumÃ© tell about a person?Â\\xa0 Simply the ability to write a good rÃ©sumÃ©. The rÃ©sumÃ© doesnâ\\x80\\x99t reflect skill, potential, or aptitude. Indian companies figured this out long ago. So they started putting applicants through batteries of psychometric tests and rigorous interviews. They hire for general ability and aptitude, rather than specialized domain and technical skills. Indian companies also learned to cast a wider net when looking for people with potential. Instead of hiring only from elite engineering colleges, technology companies such as Infosys, HCL, and TCS recruit from second- and third-tier colleges all across the country, and also in arts and science schools. Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s largest call-center operator, Genpact, has set up branded storefronts in 19 cities, where applicants can learn about the company and apply for a job; no resume required.New-employee training: Companies in India assume that new recruits will have to be trained practically from scratch. So most large companies have built dedicated learning centers, and some employ hundreds of training staff. The Infosys Global Education Centre at Mysore can train 13,500 people at a time. New recruits attend a 16-week boot camp that strengthens their technical, communications, and management skills. For its arts and science recruits, TCS provides an additional three months of training. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right: fresh recruits get four to seven months of training before starting work.Continuing training: Employees are typically required to participate in a wide range of education programs, including not only technical and domain training but also a wide range of soft skills and management skills encompassing training in quality processes; communication; and cultural, foreign-language and personal-effectiveness skills. It is common for companies to mandate one to four weeks of yearly training for employees. That is more than the vacation time that many Americans get. And these workers get rewarded for improving their skills: career advancement and salary increases are usually tied to the completion of training.Companies donâ\\x80\\x99t just offer online courses. They have programs of mentorship by senior executives; peer learning and knowledge sharing; and job-rotation programs. Take the example of Cadence India.Â\\xa0 Its CEO, Jaswinder Ahuja, instituted a â\\x80\\x9cleaders as teachersâ\\x80\\x9d program under which every manager is required to spend one to two weeks teaching internal classes. Not even the CEO is exempted from this rule. Training is considered so important that the most senior executives do their part. Trainers are often the most skilled and successful employees rather than those who couldnâ\\x80\\x99t cut it in customer engagements.Managerial development: Managers are typically groomed through fast-track programs that provide management training and mentorship to highly performing employees. Preference is usually given to internal staff to fill management openings. (Yes, many companies have a policy that insiders get first dibs at management jobs). The formal training curricula include project-management, team-building, people-management, communication, coaching, and other managerial skills. On-the-job learning is provided through a variety of structured developmental experiences: job rotations, early managerial responsibilities, cross-functional projects and experiences, and intrapreneurship initiatives.There was a time when Indian companies were so desperate to hire western-trained and -educated managers that these people would command premium salaries. Today, companies find that they can hire better talent locally. Gone are the big salaries. Returnees to India with too much management experience from abroad can have a hard time even finding a job in India.Performance management and appraisal: Companies use ERP-like systems to manage the human-development process. Employees usually get reviewed at the end of every project. They are prescribed training if found to have weakness. (Yes, the performance review is used to guide development, rather than to protect the company from lawsuits in case they need to fire you).Mechanisms such as 360-degree reviews (wherein you review your bosses and peers) and balanced-scorecard reviews are widely used. Managers are evaluated on a variety of non-financial measures, including employee satisfaction, attrition rates, and mentoring.Where is the proof that these policies work?The myth is that Indian IT companies have high turnover that is and getting worse. As the graph below shows, at a time when the Indian IT industryâ\\x80\\x99s growth rates averaged a dizzying 40%, attrition rates at top Indian companies fell, or stayed in the low-teen percentages. Compare this with Silicon Valley, where a typical recruit works for a new employer for three to five years at best â\\x80\\x94 which translates to a 20â\\x80\\x9333% attrition rate. (Indian IT company rates dropped even further in 2009 â\\x80\\x94 not reflected in the chart).Most interestingly: Indian companies learned that with better education, employees became more productive so they could afford to payÂ\\xa0 higher salaries without hurting corporate profit margins.Additionally, the Indian R&amp;D industry has been moving into the higher realms of innovation. In the aerospace industry, Indian companies are designing the interiors of luxury jets, in-flight entertainment systems, collision-control / navigation-control systems, fuel-inverting controls, and other key components of jetliners for American and European corporations. In pharmaceuticals, Indian scientists are discovering drugs and performing clinical research for nearly all of the largest multinational drug companies. In the automotive industry, Indian engineers are helping to design bodies, dashboards, and power trains for Detroit vehicle manufacturers â\\x80\\x94 and creating their own innovations, such at the Tata Nano car. In telecommunications and computer networking, Indians are developing next-generation infrastructure for tomorrowâ\\x80\\x99s intelligent cities. There are over a hundred thousand people in India doing this type of advanced R&amp;D.The Indian experience highlights what can be achieved by investing in upgrading the skills of the workforce. If workforce training can take the output of an education system as weak as Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s and turn its graduates into world-class engineers and scientists, imagine what could be done with a worker base that has received amongst the best education in the world, as is the case in the United States.U.S. companies have long played the guru, developing and disseminating many widely adopted management and workforce practices. The time has come for the guru to learn from one of its disciples: India.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last night dozens of entrepreneurs and investors met up in Palo Alto for Startup2Startup, a program founded by Dave McClure and Leonard Speiser that&#8217;s meant to help new entrepreneurs connect with their peers, and perhaps meet some potential investors.  Each month, Startup2Startup invites a seasoned entrepreneur or tech executive to speak to the attendees; this month&#8217;s guest was Google VP Product for Google Apps Bradley Horowitz, who is charged with managing a big chunk of Google&#8217;s services, including Docs, Gmail, Calendar, Voice, and more. We&#8217;ve embedded the full video of the talk below.During his talk, Horowitz spoke at length about Google&#8217;s new Apps Marketplace, which allows businesses using Google Apps to easily sign up for a variety of third party services like TripIt and Aviary, directly linking them to their Google accounts. He then sat down for a fireside chat with Dave McClure, who asked him about a variety of issues pertaining to Buzz, Gmail, and other topics.Here are some of my notes from the fireside chat:Horowitz says the Buzz team accomplished &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; feats in the first 48 hours after Buzz&#8217;s release to deal with the initial concernsThe launch of Buzz and the experiences of the team are extending not just to the Buzz and Gmail teams, but to all of Google as they think about the opportunity that social brings.Google is thinking about how to make following less Boolean (either on or off). Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a personal relevance, that allows me to get the parts of your life that I&#8217;m interested in, and filter out other parts. Google is really good at relevance and ranking. It&#8217;s one of our core competencies, and it&#8217;s something we want to bring to this space.&#8221;&#8220;I ought to be able to follow nodes in an attention graph that aren&#8217;t just people, but imagine following a product, a place, a brand.&#8221; Twitter has done a great job at this in the sense that their profile is a proxy for an entity.&#8220;Ultimately we&#8217;d like to provide something that is a tool for managing attention.&#8221; There are too many inboxes (several Email, social network silos, etc.).Through the course of 2010, the lines between Google&#8217;s Docs products will continue to blur as they work better in tandem.With regard to payments, Google has a lot of different marketplaces (Apps Marketplace, Android, etc.) and there&#8217;s an opportunity for Google to re-factor them, build more trust with users, allow users to pay in situ. There&#8217;s also opportunities in being open, allowing users to pay with whatever methodology they&#8217;re comfortable with.With regard to policing applications on the App Marketplace (users on Google Apps can now hand their data over to third party apps using OAuth, and there&#8217;s a risk that they could be hacked or do something malicious), Horowitz says that Google &#8220;hasn&#8217;t ironed out all the eventualities in this process that might occur&#8221;. But administrators are given choice over what data they are handing over. It&#8217;s possible that this data could be abused/hacked. &#8220;In many ways you&#8217;re only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.&#8221; Companies will have to establish reputations with how they handle data and get better at disclosure. &#8220;We need to get better as an industry with helping users understand the flow of data&#8221;.Number two app on the Apps Marketplace is Aviary, the free image editor, which surprised HorowitzApp Stores on mobile seem obvious, and until there&#8217;s a way to compile for all these devices, there&#8217;s going to be these different flavors of App Store. The opportunity toÂ\\xa0get beyond that is HTML5 and web apps.Here&#8217;s the Horowitz&#8217;s full talk and the fireside chat, broken into two parts:Part 1    Part 2    Here&#8217;s a one on one interview McClure and Horowitz conducted before the talk:    CrunchBase Information',\n",

Lyons, says the rumor, actually writes the scripts for all of the videos, and Brian Hogg acts them out with the puppet.The fact that Lyons promotes many of the Mosspuppet videos on Fake Steve certainly suggests a strong connection.The truth, at least according to Dan Lyons (I think I was talking to Dan, but it may have been Fake Steve. I&#8217;m never sure with him): Not true. Lyons says he helped Hogg with some of the early scripts and has advised him to shorten the videos, but other than that he&#8217;s just a fan. &#8220;Would you lie to me, Dan?&#8221;&#8220;Never, Mike.

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier today, two men were spotted having coffee in Palo Alto, CA. Except these weren&#8217;t just any two men. They were the CEOs of perhaps the two most important and powerful companies in Silicon Valley right now, Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Big deal, you might think. After all, Schmidt used to be on Apple&#8217;s board. But ever since he stepped down (and actually before he did), the growing animosity between the two formerly close companies has been apparent.So what does their coffee date mean? Well, obviously, only Jobs and Schmidt know for sure. Gizmodo, which scored the pictures, also has accounts that they were discussing technology. It&#8217;s a better sign than if they were screaming at one another, I suppose. But, as with anything Apple, you should never discount the possibility that this entire thing was staged so that someone would see them and snap a picture that would produce a thousand blog posts.Few companies (if any) handle their image better than Apple. So the fact that these images exist immediately raised the notion in my head that Apple wants them to exist. Remember, these pictures come after weeks of Apple getting dragged through the mud as a big bully for moves such as suing HTC over mobile patents, a move which everyone realizes is actually a suit over Google&#8217;s Android operating system infringing on those patents. And then, of course, there&#8217;s what Steve Jobs supposedly said about Google at an Apple Town Hall meeting.So anyway, regardless of the circumstances behind the meeting, the meeting itself is interesting given the current state of affairs between Apple and Google. And when I see these pictures, I can&#8217;t help but think I&#8217;ve seen this scene before â\\x80\\x94 in several movies. I&#8217;m just not sure which one today&#8217;s meeting more closely resembles. (Warning: A few movie spoilers ahead.)Movie 1: HeatMichael Mann&#8217;s 1995 movie Heat, is one of my favorite movies. In it, there&#8217;s a scene in which Al Pacino&#8217;s cop character, Vincent Hanna, pulls over Robert De Niro&#8217;s criminal character, Neil McCauley, and says, &#8220;What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?&#8221; McCauley agrees, and the two enemies lay aside their differences for a few minutes to share some coffee at a local diner. The resulting talk is brilliant. It&#8217;s just two guys sharing their hardships brought about by their professions. They even note that in another life, they could probably be friends, but in this life, the next time they meet, they&#8217;ll probably have to kill one another.Movie 2: 500 Days Of SummerThis movie springs to mind because I&#8217;ve used it before to talk about the break up of Apple and Google. In the film, after the breakup occurs, Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) meet up in a park after having not seen each other for some time. It&#8217;s awkward as Summer is now married, and Tom is still alone. There&#8217;s clearly no hope for them to get back together, but the meeting ultimately ends up being a good one because they can both move on.Movie 3: The Princess BrideThis reference was brought up almost immediately in the Gizmodo comments and by Digital Daily. In the movie, Westley (Cary Elwes) sits down to share a drink with Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) â\\x80\\x94 but one of their drinks is poisoned. In the ensuing battle of wits, Vizzini believes he has tricked Westley (known to him only as the &#8220;Man In Black&#8221;) into drinking the poison, but little does he know that both cups were actually poisoned â\\x80\\x94 and Westley is immune. It is Westley who gets the last laugh.Movie 4: ScarfacePacino again. In this movie, his character, Tony Montana, goes to meet with Alex Sosa, a Bolivian drug lord â\\x80\\x94 and Tony&#8217;s main enemy. Sosa ends up helping Tony by revealing that one of his colleagues, Omar, is an informant. Omar is killed and Tony strikes a huge deal for 2,000 kilos of cocaine.Movie 5: Batman BeginsIn this film, a young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) recklessly goes to meet with his enemy, crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Falcone points a gun at Wayne and threatens to kill him. Years later, Wayne, as Batman, gets him back.Movie 6: LostOkay, not a movie, but Lost might as well be one. The current plot of the final season revolves heavily around Jacob vs. The Man In Black (yes, just like The Princess Bride). At the end of last season, the two sit side-by-side on the beach and the Man In Black says to Jacob, &#8220;do you have any idea how badly I want to kill you?&#8221; Jacob replies, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; But neither kills the other, they just sit there, and reflect.Movie 7: The Seventh SealIn this movie, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) routinely meets up with Death (Bengt Ekerot) to play a game of chess. If Block can defeat his rival in the game, he won&#8217;t die. Death gets his man, in the end.So that&#8217;s seven examples of would-be rivals taking a break from their fighting to meet up for some face time. There must be dozens others. Interestingly, in none of these situations do both sides end up making amends permanently. And actually, I&#8217;m having a hard time coming up with any example of a film where two sides patch things up over coffee. Not that movies are real-life, of course â\\x80\\x94 but art does imitate life. That doesn&#8217;t speak well for Apple and Google.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Factual, which is an open database wiki, just added some tools to help visualize the data entered on the site.  Every table now has a &#8220;visualizations&#8221; tab which lets anyone who publishes a set of data an easy way to turn that data into graphs, maps, and images.  For instance, here is a map view of a restaurant database.  Here is one for hiking trails which shows a difficulty dial, the length of the route, today&#8217;s weather, and which seasons the trail is open.  Each visualization can be embedded as code onto a Website and is directly editable.  For every entry there is an &#8220;edit this&#8221; button which lets anyone correct mistakes or add more information.In other words, people don&#8217;t have to go to Factual&#8217;s website to add restaurants or hiking rails to each database.  They can edit the information directly on Websites where the visualizations are embedded.To encourage developers and designers to create more visualization templates, Factual is running a $500 contest for the best new visualizations to show off its databases of iPhone apps or cancer doctors in the U.S.  Factual was founded by Applied Semantics co-founder Gil Elbaz and raised $1 million in seed funding earlier this year from Andreessen Horowitz, Idealab, and a group of super angels.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Apple&#8217;s stock is up over $3 today, pushing it past the $230-a-share mark. Microsoft&#8217;s is down $0.25, pushing it below the $30-a-share mark. While this discrepancy is huge on the surface, it doesn&#8217;t mean all that much because there are many, many more outstanding shares of Microsoft stock out there on the market (ten times more, in fact). That&#8217;s why Microsoft&#8217;s market cap is higher than Apple&#8217;s, despite the individual stock price difference. But that market cap gap is closing. Quickly.Apple looks poised to get within $50 billion of Microsoft market cap any day now. Currently, Apple&#8217;s market cap is $208.76 billion, while Microsoft&#8217;s is $261.01 billion. And while $50 billion may seem like a huge chasm, consider that since December 31, 2009, just a few months ago, Apple has added about $20 billion to its market cap, while Microsoft has lost about $10 billion. Again, the gap is closing, quickly.Things are even more insane when you look at the data from a decade ago. Back then, Microsoft&#8217;s market cap was nearly $590 billion. It was the most valuable company in the world â\\x80\\x94 by far (#2, GE, was over $100 billion behind). Apple, meanwhile, had a market cap of just $16 billion at the time. It was the 339th most valuable company in the world, two spots behind Volkswagen.Those were, of course, different times. Aside from that 2000 spike, Microsoft&#8217;s stock and value has remained largely stagnant. For example, it 1999, its market cap was $271 billion â\\x80\\x94 $10 billion more than it is today. Apple, meanwhile, didn&#8217;t make the list that year. But with a stock price around $10 at that time, it was likely worth around $5 billion. But that&#8217;s the point. Aside from a dip during the stock market collapse at the end of 2008, Apple stock has been skyrocketing. In the past 10 years, it&#8217;s up over 500%. In that same time frame, Microsoft&#8217;s stock is down nearly 50% (again from those early 2000 numbers). Apple has soared past HP, Oracle, IBM, and most recently, Google, to move into the top five most valuable companies in the U.S.And again, that&#8217;s at a stock price of $230. And that&#8217;s before the iPad has even launched. Certainly, you could argue that if the device isn&#8217;t a complete blow-out hit, the stock will take a hit (and probably a fairly big one). But if it is a hit (and early pre-sales numbers suggest it may well be), the stock has just as good of a chance to soar further. In fact, several financial analysts are already upping the sales price target into the stratosphere. Credit Suisse, for example, set it to $300 today.Now, I&#8217;m generally wary of anything coming from analysts, but let&#8217;s just say Apple did hit $300-a-share. Remember, their performance the past few quarters has been stellar, and there is no reason to think that will stop, even without considering the iPad. So at $300-a-share, assuming the number of shares remains fairly constant, Apple would be worth $270 billion. Yes, ahead of Microsoft (assuming their market cap remains the same over that time).If that happens (and again, I venture to say it will happen), Apple fanboys will go through the roof. Never mind that last quarter, Microsoft still made more revenue than Apple ($19 billion versus $15 billion) and posted almost exactly double the profit ($6.6 billion versus $3.3 billion â\\x80\\x94 though, thanks in large part to early Windows 7 sales). The perception is that Apple has been hitting home runs the past several years, while Microsoft has been largely stagnant with some big strikeouts (Vista).To mix in another sports analogy, Apple, it seems, simply picked the right time to back the right horse: mobile. As executives have been saying recently, Apple now considers itself a mobile devices company, because most of their money comes from there (they include laptops in that category). Microsoft, meanwhile, is just about the furthest thing from a mobile devices company. The only device they make themselves is the Zune, and their mobile software Windows Mobile, well, really dropped the ball the past decade. They&#8217;re now trying to capture some of that Apple mobile magic with Windows Phone 7 Series, and projects like the Pink phone and the Courier.Here&#8217;s the real problem for Microsoft though. If Apple does in fact pass Microsoft in market cap, I can see CEO Steve Ballmer losing it, and that could steal his focus away from what should still be considered his real enemy: Google. It is Google, after all, that is directly attacking the core Microsoft brands, Office and Windows, where the company makes practically all of its money. Google Apps and Chrome OS are meant to do two things: Kill Office and kill Windows.Sure, Apple&#8217;s OS X competes with Windows, but Apple is clearly never going to license out its OS (after a disastrous attempt to do so in the 1990s when Steve Jobs was away), so its market share can only ever be as big as people buying expensive Apple machines. Apple simply cares more about profits and controlling the high end of the market, then going directly after Windows.And actually, if both were smart and could bury the hatchet, Microsoft and Apple might be wise to team up. Google is now clearly an enemy for both of them. (Which is a bit odd, considering that it used to be Apple and Google teaming up in a major way to take on the shared rival, Microsoft.) If Microsoft really wants to compete in search, for example, their best move may be to strike a deal with Apple to become the default on the iPhone (and iPad).But I&#8217;m worried such rational thinking will go out the window if Apple passes Microsoft in market cap. And internal bickering at Microsoft will stop them from gaining focus. Or, rather, when Apple passes Microsoft in market cap.The trajectory of the two stocks in recent years:And here&#8217;s a chart for a little overall perspective on stock prices:Silicon Alley Insider also recently made a nice chart of the market cap battle between the two:[image: 20th Century Fox]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Facebook introduced some changes to its privacy policy today in advance of new features which will be rolling out soon, perhaps during its f8 developer conference next month.  Some of the changes foreshadow new features dealing with location, taking advantage of the expanded &#8220;Everyone&#8221; settings, syncing contacts on your mobile phone with your Facebook contacts, and sharing your personal data with select Facebook Connect partners.The most significant change seems like it could allow third-party sites to automatically sign you into Facebook Connect  just based on your browser cookies.  Another change sets up new location features.  Facebook previously added some location language to its privacy policy back in October, but it&#8217;s now tweaked it again.  It looks like not only will it be possible to associate a specific location with status updates, photo uploads, and other posts, but Facebook will also make it possible to add a geo-component Facebook pages, such as one for a store or a restaurant.  So a link to a fan page for a store could also carry with it where it is located.The other changes make it clearer what it means when you share your status updates and posts with &#8220;everyone&#8221; and who can find that information.  It also makes a distinction between your ability to control who can access information on your personal page versus stuff you share on public pages.  There is also a change which talks about syncing your Facebook contacts with those on your mobile phone, another indication of how serious Facebook is about its mobile efforts.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In anticipation of a slew of new features that will be launching at f8, today Facebook announced that it was once again making changes to its privacy policy (you can see our post outlining these changes here).  One of the biggest changes that Facebook is making involves applications and third-party websites. We&#8217;ve been hearing whispers from multiple sources about these changes, and the announcement all but confirms what Facebook is planning to do.  In short, it sounds like Facebook is going to be automatically opting users into a reduced form of Facebook Connect on certain third party sites â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0a bold change that may well unnerve users, at least at first.  Here&#8217;s how Facebook is describing the change in its blog post:Today, when you use applications such as games on Facebook.com or choose to connect to Facebook on sites across the web, you are able to find and interact with your friends. These applications require a small set of basic information about you in order to provide a relevant experience. After feedback from many of you, we announced in August that we were moving toward a model that gives you clearer controls over what data is shared with applications and websites when you choose to use them.In the proposed privacy policy, we&#8217;ve also explained the possibility of working with some partner websites that we pre-approve to offer a more personalized experience at the moment you visit the site. In such instances, we would only introduce this feature with a small, select group of partners and we would also offer new controls.So what does that mean?  We&#8217;ve heard that select Facebook partners will now be able to look for your existing Facebook cookie to identify you, even if you never opted into Facebook Connect on the site you&#8217;re visiting.  Using that, the third party site will be able to display your friends and other key information.  It&#8217;s possible that these sites will also be able to display any data you&#8217;ve shared with &#8216;everyone&#8216;, which is of course now the default option on Facebook.Facebook&#8217;s draft privacy policy states that you&#8217;ll be able to opt-out of these sites, and you&#8217;ll also be able to opt-out of these &#8216;pre-approved&#8217; experiences entirely.  But by default, you&#8217;re all in. How convenient.Here&#8217;s the langauge from the draft privacy policy itself. Note that the &#8216;About Platform&#8217; page does not yet include a list of approved partners:Pre-Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications. In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Facebook, we occasionally need to provide General Information about you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to Facebook). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In these cases we require these websites and applications to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these agreements include provisions relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered. You can also remove any pre-approved website or application you have visited here [add link], or block all pre-approved websites and applications from getting your General Information when you visit them here [add link]. In addition, if you log out of Facebook before visiting a pre-approved application or website, it will not be able to access your information. You can see a complete list of pre-approved websites on our About Platform page.Here&#8217;s how Facebook defines the term &#8216;General Information&#8217;:The term General Information includes your and your friendsâ\\x80\\x99 names, profile pictures, gender, connections, and any content shared using the Everyone privacy setting. We may also make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate content.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday, we wrote about the great lengths many cities and towns were taking to catch the attention of Google, in the hope that the search giant would choose their community for its experimental fiber network. The broadband network would be completely free for the chosen city (only the consumers using the services will be charged) and the 1Gb/sec fiber would be roughly 100 times faster than what most Americans get today for Internet speeds. Google&#8217;s plan is to reach anywhere from 50,000 to 500,000 people with this experiment. City mayors did everything under the sun to try to appeal to Google, including jumping into freezing lakes and shark tanks and even renaming a city &#8220;Google.&#8221; The deadline to apply to be one of Google&#8217;s guinea pigs ends today and according to a blog post, Google has received more than 600 applications from communities and towns across the U.S.That&#8217;s an impressive number and the application process still isn&#8217;t over with four more hours to go until the deadline. Google asked that interested municipalities fill out a Request for Information (RFI) to help determine the best community for the experiment. Google estimated that each form/request from cities would take around 4 hours to complete. Individuals and citizens can also submit letters of support for cities; Google says that over 190,000 letters have been submitted over the past month. The next step, says Google, is to review all of the city applications and individual letters of support, perform site visits, consult with third-party organizations as well has communicate with local officials in cities of interest. A final city/town is expected to be announced by the end of the year. As we wrote yesterday, Google plan is designed to compliment the U.S. government&#8217;s ten year broadband plan, which among other goals, wants to subsidize broadband connections in rural areas, and bring 1-gigabit connections to every community in the U.S. But there are a number of flaws with the government&#8217;s strategy, namely that the plans aren&#8217;t ambitious enough. For example, under the new plan, some 85% of homes covered would have no choice when it comes to a provider, possibly locking users into higher prices because of a lack of competition.So at then end of the day, Google represents a small beacon of hope in that it could provide a concrete example for other communities or broadband providers to follow. And while Google&#8217;s initial plan involves a fiber network at a very, very small scale, if all goes well, Google could end up expanding the project nationally.  Google will be posting the final application numbers tonight. We&#8217;ll update this post with the final tally.

       "  'comments_content': 'Bags have been packed, poker chips have been cashed, and planes have been boarded &#8211; and with that, the mobile-focused CTIA 2010  convention in Las Vegas has come to a close.Each time an event like this blows through town, tech heads do their best to distract themselves from their hangovers by writing monstrous posts on which platform or technology &#8220;won&#8221; the show. When it comes to CTIA 2010, the winner is clear cut and undisputed: Android. They could have called this year&#8217;s show &#8220;Android Week&#8221; and no one would have questioned it.When we said Android went &#8220;undisputed&#8221; above, we meant it in the literal sense. Windows Phone 7 handsets are still too early in development to come out and play. Palm was only showing the AT&#038;T versions of the Pixi Plus and Pre Plus, which they&#8217;d announced in the days leading up to the show. BlackBerry&#8217;s biggest news was that their new Twitter client is launching on March 31st. Apple didn&#8217;t even show up &#8212; not that anyone expected them to, given that these deafeningly noisy shows aren&#8217;t exactly their style.Meanwhile, Android launched on no less than five major handsets:Samsung Galaxy S &#8211; The Galaxy S is big, beautiful, and bright as all hell. Really &#8212; I can&#8217;t imagine a screen brighter than this one, a 4.0&#8243; Super AMOLED screen made by Samsung themselves. I&#8217;m fairly confident that it could be used as an impromptu flash grenade, need be. The 1Ghz CPU and 5.0 megapixel camera don&#8217;t hurt, either. See our hands-on here.Motorola i1 &#8211; Motorola has finally managed to make a rugged, push-to-talk phone that doesn&#8217;t look like a rugged push-to-talk phone. There&#8217;s no absurd bulk here, and no monstrous antenna. We haven&#8217;t put this one through the paces yet &#8211; but if Mike Rowe says it can take a beating, we&#8217;ll believe it. (Fun Fact: Motorola demonstrated the durability of this phone at a private press event by having people play shuffleboard with it)Kyocera Zio &#8211; The big selling point of the Kyocera isn&#8217;t necessarily its specs &#8211; it&#8217;s the price it brings them in at. At a price coming in somewhere between $169 and $220 &#8212; without contract, mind you &#8212; Kyocera has managed to stuff in a 3.5&#8243; 800&#215;480, 3.2 megapixel camera, stereo bluetooth, and the same 600mhz processor as the Motorola Devour. Look for this one to launch on Cricket later this year.AT&#038;T Dell Aero - Essentially a reskinned version of the Dell Mini 3i that launched in China last year, the Dell Aero is AT&#038;T&#8217;s second Android phone, Dell&#8217;s first Android phone in the US, and purportedly the lightest Android phone to date. We spotted this one on the showfloor &#8212; but unfortunately, Dell wouldn&#8217;t let anyone turn it on.Sprint EVO 4G &#8211; if we had to declare one handset the winner of the show, it&#8217;d be this one.  We fell in love with this one months ago, when it was known around the rumormill as the HTC Supersonic. Sprint chose to go all out with their first WiMax phone, and it has paid off; with a 4.3&#8243; 800&#215;480 screen, 1Ghz CPU, 1GB of internal storage, 802.11b/g, HDMI-out, and the ability to act as a WiMax-powered WiFi router for up to 8 devices, the EVO 4G is now the Android handset to beat. See our hands on here.Other news from the show:Samsung finally learned to stop spoiling their announcements earlyBlueAnt announced a text-message-to-speech  app for Android, along with their first rugged Bluetooth headset, the T1. Sprint announced 7 more cities that will get WiMax this year, bringing the total up to 15.AT&#038;T finally announced pricing details for their broadband-powered signal booster, the 3G MicroCell.Skype launched their app for Verizon Android/BlackBerry handsets, allowing users to make Skype calls over Verizon&#8217;s data network without gobbling up their minutesThat&#8217;s all, folks. If you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m going to go throw my life savings at a man standing behind a green felt table and hope for the best. Wish me luck!',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Your first question is probably what the hell is a &#8220;Gobel&#8221; and will it rival Foursquare?Â\\xa0 Not quite. It&#8217;s Panasonic&#8217;s subsidiary in Indonesia and it was also a top trending topic on Twitter this morning, along with RCTI and Putra Nababan. All three are Indonesian (RCTI is an Indonesian television station and Putra Nababan is a popular TV host on RCTI) and all are connected to the apparently very popular 13th annual Panasonic Gobel Awards (celebrates TV and broadcasting achievements)&#8212; essentially Indonesia&#8217;s version of the Emmys. At last count, the number of tweets on &#8220;Panasonic Gobel&#8221; exceeded 4,500, according to Google. So why do we care?Well if you&#8217;re a venture capitalist, an entrepreneur or a corporation you should care a lot. Because it illustrates the incredible power of the Indonesian internet consumer, or rather their consumer in general. Indonesia is undergoing a period of growth (it grew 4.5% last year during the global financial crisis) but has largely flown under the radar&#8212; despite housing more than 230 million people and being the fourth most populated country in the world. Of course, Indonesia is still struggling with high unemployment and poverty but like China and India it has a growing middle class that is spending more time on the internet, especially on social media sites like Twitter. To put this power in perspective: For a few hours this morning, Panasonic&#8217;s name was on the homepage of every Twitter user that logged on.Think this event is just some anomaly? Here&#8217;s more evidence of Indonesia&#8217;s presence on Twitter: Google Trends shows that Indonesia is Twitter&#8217;s fourth largest source of traffic, behind US, Japan, Brazil.Panasonic has been increasing its footprint in the region. This month, the company announced plans to relocate factories in Japan and Vietnam to Indonesia later this year. While its coup on Twitter was unexpected, I&#8217;m sure Panasonic executives are exploring (or will soon start aggressively exploring) new ways to reach the region&#8217;s consumer through social media. So far, they don&#8217;t quite get it. I manged to talk to a few Panasonic PR reps in the US and Malaysia this morning and even Panasonic seemed surprised by their reach and not fully aware of what the Panasonic Gobel show was.Â\\xa0 Their response was a mix of &#8220;wow&#8221; (&#8220;It&#8217;s doing what on Twitter?&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;Oh, I need to join Twitter.&#8221;) and &#8220;what?&#8221; (all three representatives I talked to were either completely unaware of the show or needed to dig around to get the basic information).Full disclosure: I am part Indonesian and I covered the region a few years ago as a freelance writer for the NY Times. You can color me biased, but I think the proof is in the tweet.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Video streaming apps on the iPhone in the U.S. have always had to contend with the limitations of AT&amp;T&#8217;s data network.  For a long time, video streaming apps were not allowed in the App Store.  And when they did finally get approved, at first they could only stream videos via WiFi.As AT&amp;T slowly beefs up its data network, iPhone apps can now deliver streams over 3G.  But network availability is still an issue, so much so that Apple is now requiring that video watching apps support multiple streaming bitrates before it will approve an app.  At least that was the case for Justin.tv&#8217;s iPhone video app, which hit the App Store earlier this week.  During the approval process, Justin.tv was asked to incorporate both high-quality (200 kbps) and low-quality (64 kbps) streams.  The video switches to a low-quality when the 3G network is overloaded or only the slower EDGE network is available (which renders any video painful to watch no matter what the bitrate).&#8220;We were a bit confused by this request at the time, as none of the other live video applications in the App Store had that feature,&#8221; reports Justin.tv marketing VP Evan Solomon.  &#8220;Apple was very adamant that we add itâ\\x80\\x94they wouldn&#8217;t approve our app without it,&#8221; he adds.Apple is increasingly encouraging developers of video apps to include adaptive bitrates which vary based on the user&#8217;s connection.  Currently Apple requires all long-form video (which includes live streams and anything over 10 minutes) to support low and high quality streams.  But eventually Apple will likely start to enforce this policy for all videos and video apps, no matter what the length.  Already at least one online video platform, Brightcove, dynamically adjusts the streaming rates when it detects a video request from an iPhone app.  So it is becoming more of an industry practice. Now it looks like Apple is starting to reinforce that practice through the App Store approval process as well.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'TechCrunch50 demopit company Image Space Media (formerly Picad Media), has developed and launched an in-image ad network that helps publishers monetize images on their websites with ad overlays. Since launching in 2008, ISM has built a publisher network of 2,500 sites and recently upgraded its platform to include a detailed analytics platform. Called the PubStop platform, the tool allows publishers to value which of their images are yielding higher earnings so they can place content in the places that earn the highest click-through-rates (CTRs). The dashboard features total ad impressions, total clicks, CTRs, eCPMs, number of images and more statistics that can help publishers manage their ads on the network. Image Space Media&#8217;s ads are text only for now but founder and COO Kevin Tung says that rich media ad formats will be implemented in the network soon. While Tung declined to reveal exact CTRs that Image Space&#8217;s ads are seeing, he says that CTRs are higher than average rates for normal display ads, which he says range from .2 % to .3%. He adds that CTRs depend on size and dimensions of the ad itself. The startup also just raised $2.9 million in funding from New Atlantic Ventures, Ridgeline Capital, and Michael Gordon  and brought on a new CEO last year, Jesse Chenard, who Tung actually met at TechCrunch50 in 2008. Image Space Media faces competition from GumGum and others. \\t\\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

Here&#8217;s our list. What would you guys like to see?Carcassonne &#8211; If you&#8217;ve never split a few bottles of wine (or tequila) and played Carcassonne, you haven&#8217;t lived. To be able to play this with a few people on the iPad would be amazing and you wouldn&#8217;t have to carry all those cards around. The game is pretty simple &#8211; you put down random cards to build cities, roads, and farms. You place a knight on a card to claim it and get the knight back when you&#8217;ve completed a feature. However, it&#8217;s amazingly addictive and an iPad version would be great.Sim City &#8211; This game is already out on the iPhone but a version on a larger, more readable screen would be great. Civilization V &#8211; While I could spend most of my life playing Civ Rev on the iPhone, why not go nuts and rebuild Civ V for the iPad? I would totally pay a few dozen dollars for this.Burnout iPad Edition &#8211; My son and I have been playing Burnout Paradise like fiends lately and a big-screen, motion aware version of Burnout would make us both happy.Monopoly &#8211; This next set of games are boardgame classics. First up &#8211; Monopoly. It&#8217;s a no brainer.Connect 4 &#8211; There are only knock off versions of Connect 4 on the App Store right now, but a big screen version would be great.Battleship &#8211; The current version if iPhone Battleship looks great but why not buy two iPads so you can recreate Battleship in all it&#8217;s &#8220;You sunk my&#8230;&#8221; glory? Then again, maybe not.Air Hockey &#8211; This is totes magotes one of my favorites. The iPhone version is great for two players and an iPad version would be even better.Incredible Machine &#8211; Remember this insanity? The Incredible Machine was a 1990s Rube Goldberg video game dedicated to teaching kids how to make things work together. I haven&#8217;t played it in years but a 3D, Enigmo-esque version would be great.Planetfall &#8211; One of the original Infocom classics. Listen: the iPad has a usable keyboard and can support external keyboards. Why not slap together an Infocom pack for $2 and sell some imagination to these whippersnappers. Who&#8217;s with me?',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Nokia has acquired Novarra, an Illinois-based company that develops mobile web browser technologies. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The acquisition makes sense, considering that Nokia builds its own browser. Nokia says Novarra&#8217;s technology will be integrated to provide a more powerful browsing experience on Nokia phones. Novarra which was founded in 1999, raised $50 million in funding in 2007. The company creates web-based technologies for low-end mobile feature devices, including functionality for internet access, portals, videos, widgets and advertising. Novarra supplied its technologies to Palm and U.S. Cellular previously. While Nokia develops and operates its own browser on its devices, the Nokia&#8217;s Ovi store offers third-party browsers for some phones, including Opera Mini and Skyfire. Nokia is still the world&#8217;s top mobile phone maker, and posted impressive 2009 fourth quarter results in January. The company shipped 126.9 million units in the fourth quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 12% year on year. Unfortunately, yearly results weren&#8217;t as strong. Nokia was down 20% on net sales compared to 2008. Nokia&#8217;s last acquisition was of travel social network Dopplr,  which we heard the mobile device company was looking to sell. Nokia was on a bit of an acquisition tear last year, also buying up Plum, Cellity and Bit-Side.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Print publishers are in a tizzy over Apple&#8217;s new iPad because they hope to finally be able to charge for their digital editions.  But in order to get people to pay for their magazine and newspaper apps, they are going to have to offer something different that readers cannot get at the newsstand or on the open Web.  We&#8217;ve already seen plenty of prototypes from magazine publishers which include interactive graphics, photo slide shows, and embedded videos.  But what should a magazine cover look like on the iPad? After all, the cover is still the gateway to the magazine.  Theoretically, it will still be the first page people see, giving them hints of what&#8217;s inside and enticing them to dive into the issue.  One way these covers could change is that instead of simply repurposing the static photographs from the print edition, the background image itself could be some sort of video loop.  Jesse Rosten, a photographer in California, created the video mockup below of what a cover of Sunset Magazine might look like on the iPad (see video below).  The video shows ocean waves gently lapping a beach as the title of the magazine and other typographical elements appear on the page almost like movie credits.  He points out that these kinds of videos will have to be shot in a vertical orientation rather than a horizontal landscape one.  This is just a mockup Rosten came up with on his own, but the designers of these new magazine apps should take note.  The only way people are going to pay for these apps is if they create new experiences for readers.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday we gave you an intro into the first real Twitter television initiative, Twision, originating from none other than a digital TV channel in Spain, VEO7, a part of Unidad Editorial.Veo7 launched their first Twision program last Thursday and will continue to air every Thursday evening at midnight. Here&#8217;s some more post-launch insight into the initiative.Unlike other international attempts to integrate Twitter, uni-directionally, Twision viewers are able to use the #veo7 hashtag to speak directly to presenters and influence where the program&#8217;s discussion goes &#8212; branded &#8220;twittertulia&#8221;.During the latest program (which is at midnight and Veo7 is not  a prime channel), Melchor Miralles&#8217; timeline crashed and he was quickly buried under nearly 2,000 comments and suggestions.The numbers? 80,000 watched the program for the entire hour, while 659,000 watched at least some of it. Worthwhile? Certainly, and if they do this right, they could position this as &#8216;people&#8217;s channel&#8217;.Veo7 in itself aims to be open, collaborative and highly sensitive to public opinion. They&#8217;re deploying a very active social media strategy, reaching out to their audience. As an extension of their motto to involve the viewer, they launched the Twision program, essentially an innovative way to integrate two platforms, television and twitter for live programming, an idea born to Jaime GutiÃ©rrez-Colomer.Prior to launch, without advertising, the #veo7 hashtag took 5th place as a trending topic in Spain and repeatedly peaked to 1st place.Veo7 is taking Twitter very seriously. Every presenter has a twitter account and more importantly, they use them, live. Can you think of a better way to do live, interactive and viral programming if not on using the most popular social platform for fast expression?Melchor Miralles, General Director of Veo7 as well as the presenter, promises that as the program evolves, users will be able to get more and more involved, as a fundamental decision maker in the channel&#8217;s programming. Tonight&#8217;s program focuses on theÂ\\xa0#manifiesto, Spain&#8217;s online community&#8217;s manifest &#8220;In Defense of Fundamental Internet Rights&#8221;.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This is why I have a strong dislike of government and our system of lobbyists. Many people in the tech community are becoming increasingly skeptical of Google&#8217;s motives in partially pulling out of the Chinese markets and starting to suggest a certain level of hypocrisy. Google gets hacked over the Christmas holidays when most people aren&#8217;t watching the ship, and all of their source code for all of their products is, embarrassingly, downloaded to a Chinese hacker. Their response? Pull out of a search market that they are already failing in. But leave other assets that have more promise.And suddenly the U.S. Congress is praising Google and slamming, well, Microsoft. Because doing business in China was just fine in December 2009. But today it&#8217;s very, very wrong. Says Chris Smith, R-N.J.: They [Microsoft] need to get on the right side of human rights rather than enabling tyranny, which they&#8217;re doing right now.And GoDaddy, a domain registrar that markets itself by suggesting to users that buying domain names can get them laid, gets in on the action, too. Representative Smith &#8220;praised Internet domain host site GoDaddy.com which said it will no longer offer new Chinese Web domains.&#8221;Also in on the feeding frenzy was Senator Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who applauded Google&#8217;s actions by bravely leaving the Chinese market.Let&#8217;s put aside the fact that Google has given $8,500 and GoDaddy has given $19,500 to Senator Dorgan. Because politicians never do favors for people who donate to their campaign funds, of course.But let&#8217;s not put aside the fact that Go Daddy has registered a mere 27,000 .CN domain names over the years, constituting approximately 0.08% of their 35 million domains under management.Really, GoDaddy? Explain again how this isn&#8217;t a publicity stunt?GoDaddy most certainly did pull a publicity stunt, and the publicity was provided by our government. And Google, who had nothing bad to say about China in 2009, is now suggesting Microsoft is only doing business in China to irk Google. Said Google&#8217;s Sergey Brin of Microsoft:&#8220;I&#8217;m very disappointed for them in particular,&#8221; Brin said. &#8220;As I understand, they have effectively no market share â\\x80\\x93 so they essentially spoke against freedom of speech and human rights simply in order to contradict Google.&#8221; Brin&#8217;s hypocrisy is astounding. GoDaddy&#8217;s brashness is&#8230;funny. But our government&#8217;s willingness to play this game, and trash Microsoft for not deciding that China is evil at exactly the same moment that Google did, is sad and irresponsible.We all buy China&#8217;s stuff every day. Our government is financed by Chinese credit. Whatever China is or isn&#8217;t, we are all very much in business with them. Even Google, who retains sales and R&amp;D staff in China and is certainly going to sell a ton of Android handsets there. I can hold my nose at all the BS that Google spouts as they extricate themselves from a sticky situation. I can put up with GoDaddy purchasing publicity from a U.S. Senator. But what I can&#8217;t sit and watch is Microsoft being raked over the coals by a government that does nothing to fight the evil that they say exists in China, just to give a little bit back to a couple of companies that have thrown some money their way.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last week, I wrote about check-in fatigue. While there is a lot of excitement right now surrounding location-based apps, and particularly the ones where you &#8220;check-in&#8221; places, trying to use all of them can be exhausting, as I found out at SXSW. So what&#8217;s the solution? Do you just pick one and stick with it? You could, but there&#8217;s no guarantee that all of your friends will pick the same one as you. So the guys behind Brightkite have a better solution.Check.in is an application that lets you check-in with multiple services at the same time. Or, as they put it, it&#8217;s &#8220;on check-in to rule them all.&#8221; While the team showed it to me briefly at SXSW (and CrunchGear got some video of it in action), they&#8217;ve actually given me access to it now to play around with. And I&#8217;m happy to report that it works great.So how does it work? Well, for the time being it&#8217;s actually a mobile web app. Eventually, the plan is to release a native app version for the different platforms, but in order to get it out there relatively quickly, they made a web version that works on mobile browser that offer HTML5 support for location (currently the iPhone and Android phones). When you load it up, the browser asks for permission to pull your coordinates, and a few seconds later it pulls up a list of venues it believes you&#8217;re near. When you click on one, the app does some &#8220;magical matching&#8221; to find the venue across the various services. (If it&#8217;s unsure it asks you to confirm the venue for each different service â\\x80\\x94 a bit tedious, but it goes fast as it&#8217;s just one click.) You&#8217;re then taken to the final check-in page where you can leave an optional message (which will also get sent to each of the services) and if you&#8217;re good to go, you simply hit the check-in button, and you&#8217;re done.Currently, Check.in works with three services: Brightkite (of course), Foursquare, and Gowalla. But it&#8217;s important to note that the team is likely going to have to pull Gowalla support because that service doesn&#8217;t yet technically support writing to their API (only reading from it). Check.in found a work-around through an undocumented API. Still, the Check.in team hopes to add other services quickly as check-in APIs become available.So how much time does Check.in save? At least a few minutes just for the three aforementioned services that it currently works with. Remember, checking-in with all of these apps requires not only that you open each one, but that you wait to pull friend data and location data before you can check-in. Check.in cuts out most of that load time by removing the friend element, and doing the location loads all at once.If they&#8217;re able to get all the services playing nicely with their check-in APIs, Check.in is going to be the perfect solution for check-in fatigue. But don&#8217;t be surprised if one of the bigger players, like Facebook, are thinking about this as well.Check.in will be launching in beta very shortly.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s an interesting time to be in the e-book business. E-readers in their many varieties are sussing out the perfect user experience, and the race to the bottom might end up with students packing a Kobo into their bag instead of 20 pounds of expensive textbooks. When it comes down to it, though, you&#8217;re selling a mostly static experience &mdash; as indeed books have been for a long time. Interaction in books is the realm of children: pop-ups and coloring books. But the move to new and interesting devices has some people excited about the future of text &mdash; and this Text 2.0 idea may just change how you think about interacting with books.The idea is that it tracks where you&#8217;re looking, and based on a number of factors, triggers one of several context-sensitive actions. An eye-tracking interface is an entirely new beastie, however, and somehow I&#8217;m not convinced that real life usage will be quite as easy to collate and react to as this video seems to suggest.Now, there&#8217;s a whole world of UI implications that follow from the ability of a device to track where you&#8217;re looking. A whole system of navigation and file management controlled by gaze and blinks &mdash; the possibilities are endless. Remember the EyeWriter, a project allowing a quadriplegic artist to sketch things with only his eyes? But I digress. What&#8217;s on the table now is this Text 2.0 implementation of eye-tracking.While I appreciate what&#8217;s on offer, I have to wonder whether it&#8217;s something human beings would really appreciate. The simple fact is this: we don&#8217;t interact with things using our eyes. That&#8217;s what our hands are for. And that&#8217;s why the next generation of books and magazines is going to be both rich and tactile. While certainly you could train yourself to &#8220;click&#8221; with your eyes, I&#8217;m skeptical of the preferability of that over a simple touch-based interface. When the eye is the only or best input (as with the EyeWriter) then it&#8217;s a go, but for all others, any action that might be taken with the eye (getting a word definition or something) could be done just as easily with a quick gesture &mdash; and there&#8217;s much less room for error.Speaking of error, I&#8217;m also concerned about the level of precision necessary. This thing has to be able to tell whether I&#8217;m looking at the last letter of a sentence or the asterisk above it; that&#8217;s probably more than you can ask of a pair of tiny bezel cameras with fixed-focus lenses. The technology they&#8217;re using to develop Text 2.0 costs upwards of $10,000 &mdash; of course, that could come down or the software be ported to more cost-effective hardware, but can it really do what it says it can do and still be affordable?Well, I can see I&#8217;m coming off as a sort of tech pedant here. This isn&#8217;t a ready-for-market product, it&#8217;s a cool concept being worked on by some very smart people, and I can think of quite a few applications for this right off the top of my head. Kids learning to read would be a perfect example &mdash; a couple of these in a remedial reading class would probably raise scores significantly. But they clearly have some hurdles ahead of them if this is to be anything other than an academic project.In the end, though, I think these guys are a little too far ahead of the curve, if anything. If gaze detection is to play a part in any future UIs, I get the feeling that the meta-text interface will follow from established user behavior patterns in a broader UI scheme, rather than being specific to a single purpose, as they are in Text 2.0. That all will be seen, however &mdash; as soon as we get our eye-tracking Chrome OS iPad XPs.[via Wired and H+]',\n",

Besides being tier one venture capitalists, at least one thing: They are all fighting furiously to be the lead investor in Foursquare&#8217;s next venture round.All that competition is driving the valuation massively upwards, too. A couple of weeks ago we&#8217;d heard that the deal would likely be closed at around a $50 million valuation. Today we&#8217;ve confirmed that the final price will likely be $60 million &#8211; $70 million.

Yu is tight with both Jack Dorsey (he&#8217;s an investor in Dorsey&#8217;s Square) and Chris Dixon (likewise, he&#8217;s an investor in Dixon&#8217;s Hunch).

Let that sink in&mdash;still think Dana White hates the Internet? In addition to serving up all 231 fights in the show&#8217;s history, fans can also interact with each other on social networking services like Twitter and Facebook. Not a bad job, really.The site mirrors MTV Networks other â\\x80\\x9cverticals,â\\x80\\x9d like those associated with The Colbert Report and The Daily Show. Full episodes can be streamed, or fight fans can pick out individual fights from the 11-season library. Perhaps you fancy seeing Kimbo Slice&#8217;s first fight again? Or maybe you&#8217;re a newcomer to the sport, and want to see how Forrest Griffin made his name? It&#8217;s all there for you, free of charge. Oh, and the videos are fully embeddable. Handy.The site serves advertisements Ã\\xa0 la Hulu, so be prepared for the occasional U.S. Marines commercial. Gotta pay the bills somehow, folks. Web sites don&#8217;t build themselves.One thing to note: season 11, which begins next week on SpikeTV, won&#8217;t be available on the Web site for a little while. The current rough plan is to make the episodes available after the season&#8217;s conclusion, to sorta bridge the gap between season 11 and 12. In the meantime, though, fans can check out the Web site after every new episode that airs on TV to watch exclusive coverage of said episode. Terribly constructed sentence, yes. You know, things like post-show analysis (Dana White chips in after the first episode), unseen footage, etc. And not just â\\x80\\x9cmeh, lameâ\\x80\\x9d bonus footage, either. We&#8217;re talking full fights that, for whatever reason (time constraints, I&#8217;d imagine) never made SpikeTV in their entirety.Twitter, darling of the Internet, has been integrated into the site pretty visibly. On the right-hand side is a small box that monitors UFC-related hash tags, including #UFC, #TUF, #DanaWhite, etc. This might not seem to exciting on a random Thursday afternoon, but during UFC events&mdash;pay-per-views, The Ultimate Fighter, SpikeTV Fight Nights, and so on&mdash;the trash talking should really fly.Just as easily accessible is the show&#8217;s Facebook page, where you can view photos and post comments about, I don&#8217;t know, how amazing GSP is, or whether or not you think Frank Mir is a jerk. (He is, but he&#8217;s the greatest jerk in history.)The very idea of UFC giving away fights is pretty much unthinkable, when you consider that three-quarters of the company&#8217;s revenue comes from pay-per-view buys. In the kick-off meeting this morning, SpikeTV explained that it took â\\x80\\x9cmany meetingsâ\\x80\\x9d to convince UFC brass to go along with the idea of putting fights&mdash;any fights!&mdash;online for free. We all know that UFC actively pursues people who go offer illegal streams of their events&mdash;the company just recently sued the owners of two Web sites that were offering illegal UFC 111 streams &mdash;so finally making at least some of its content available online is a move that should be applauded. Remember, this is a company that lived and died (well, mostly lived these days!) on its pay-per-view buys, so giving away fights for free may felt a little strange at first for Dana White &#038; Co.And now we wait for Frank Mir to choke out Shane Carwin, setting up Lesnar v. Mir II. That has pay-per-view buys written all over it.',\n",

But it&#8217;s also very, very good for Facebook as hundreds of thousands of websites will rush to format their content to exactly Facebook&#8217;s preference and send over all their data without a second thought. One way to think of this, says a source with knowledge of the product, is this. Google spends billions of dollars indexing the web for their search engine. Facebook will get the web to index itself, exclusively for Facebook.Yes, it&#8217;s a big idea. Or, as MG put it, the entire Internet will be turned into a tributary system for Facebook. And it all flows from a simple Like gesture, and a few other features we&#8217;ll be writing about shortly.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Right before the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas a couple weeks ago, some of you may have read about SimpleGeo&#8217;s awesome location data visualization tool called Vicarious.ly. The site showed location information coming in to SimpleGeo from Austin in realtime, and included elements such as Foursquare check-ins, Gowalla check-ins, geotagged pictures from Flickr, and geotagged tweets from Twitter. It was really interesting to watch in realtime, but it may be even more interesting in hindsight. Luckily, SimpleGeo has released a video to show the data over the span of just about a week (March 11 to March 17).As you can see, Foursquare and Gowalla clearly dominate the data. This is in line with what we heard in the midst of the so-called &#8220;location war&#8221; between the two. It&#8217;s also kind of fun to watch the early hours of the morning when everyone is clearly asleep, and then watch as the data comes roaring back to life around 8 AM as festival-goers undoubtedly nursed hangovers to head to the convention center.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The problem with having more than a million followers on Twitter, or even more than 1,000, is that you don&#8217;t really know who they are.  But Hunch thinks it knows a lot about the followers of at least popular Twitter users.  It is now pulling together detailed psychographic profiles of those followers with a new Twitter Followers tool.  For instance, Hunch suggests that if you follow TechCrunch on Twitterâ\\x80\\x94as close to 1.4 million of you doâ\\x80\\x94you are more likely to be entrepreneurial, very experienced in your career, and talk about computers &#8220;like a gear head talking about a four-barrel V8 engine.&#8221;  It also predicts that you are more likely to have bought someone flowers in the past 6 months, get birthday cakes from expensive bakeries, and are an optimist (if you drop a piece of toast you believe it will land butter-side up).  I&#8217;ve met some of you, and I&#8217;m not so sure you&#8217;d buy anyone an expensive cake.  But some of the other characterizations seem spot on.  Hunch is using this Twitter follower analyzer as a clever way to get more people to check out its taste recommendation engine.  Any question-answer pair can be Tweeted out with a link back to the full analysis.  It only works right now for Twitter accounts with more than 1,000 followers (to keep everything anonymous).  Hunch looks at the overlap between those followers and its own users, who have already answered dozens of taste-related questions, and extrapolates from there.  This is slightly different from the Twitter Predictor game it released last week which predicts how you will answer a set of questions based on your Twitter profile and who you follow.  Breaking down the psychographics and predilections of someone&#8217;s Twitter followers could be useful one day if anyone ever figures out how to advertise to those followers in a way that doesn&#8217;t make them want to unfollow you.  But for now it is just a fun exercise.  How accurate is it?  Let&#8217;s put it to the test.  My personal followers for @erickschonfeld on Twitter, according to Hunch, tend to be early adopters of of technology (check), use an iPhone (probably), don&#8217;t wait for the crosswalk sign to change before they cross the street (I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s true), prefer fluid and flexible jobs (check), and consider a &#8220;reasonable number of hours to work&#8221; to be &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; (yup, that&#8217;s how my posse rolls).Looking at some other media accounts, followers of the HuffingtonPost tend to be liberals (I am as shocked), think Bill Maher is funny (which might be their real problem), and don&#8217;t realize Elton John can be cheesy .  Gawker followers tend to be more &#8220;conceptual&#8221; than &#8220;factual&#8221; (draw your own conclusions).  Lance Armstrong&#8217;s followers are &#8220;extremely&#8221; competitive and &#8220;don&#8217;t like kittens&#8221; (no idea).  While Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s followers are more likely to have been in a car accident.  I couldn&#8217;t make these up if I tried.  Hunch plans to follow up with another Twitter tool where it will try to tell you what kinds of things, people, or products you might like or dislike, as opposed to your followers.  It will only be visible to you after you sign in via your Twitter account.  To learn more about Hunch&#8217;s approach to creating a &#8220;taste graph&#8221; of its users, check out this recent video interview with co-founder Caterina Fake.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A month ago, Google announced that it would be deploying its own â\\x80\\x9cexperimentalâ\\x80\\x9d fiber-optic network to U.S. communities that would be 20 times faster than residential fiber optic services offered today. As soon as the announcement was made, cities of all sizes began vying for the opportunity to be Google&#8217;s guinea pig, going through great lengths to be chosen for the trial.  Mayors signed proclamations and jumped into freezing lakes, city employees were forced to sing Google-come-hither hymns, some cities even pulled out the glow sticks.It&#8217;s understandable why cities would want to be part of Google&#8217;s broadband plan. Not only will the broadband network be completely free for the city (only the consumers using the services will be charged), but the 1Gb/sec fiber is roughly 100 times faster than what most Americans get today for Internet speeds. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s especially true in rural areas. Many of the municipal displays of Google love border on the ridiculous.  But why wouldn&#8217;t a city want Google&#8217;s stamp of approval with a side of super-fast broadband speeds? Tomorrow is the deadline for cities to submit applications and here&#8217;s a roundup of the various entertaining strategies cities have adopted to catch Google&#8217;s attention.One of the first cities to throw its hat into the ring was Topeka, Kansas. The cityâ\\x80\\x99s mayor signed a proclamation that for March, Topeka will be known as â\\x80\\x9cGoogle, Kansasâ\\x80\\x9d in honor of the search giant. In an attempt at parody, the mayor of Deluth, Minnesota mandated that all firstborn males be named &#8220;Google Fiber&#8221; and all firstborn females be named &#8220;Googlette Fiber.&#8221; Baltimore (which happens to be my hometown) took a more bureaucratic approach to the application process by appointing a &#8220;Google Czar.&#8221; The city chose Tom Loveland, CEO of a local tech company, Mind Over Machines, to take the position. Baltimore  also launched a website, BmoreFiber, which states in huge, bold letters, â\\x80\\x9cAsk Google to Invest Billions in Baltimoreâ\\x80\\x99s Future.â\\x80\\x9cCalifornia&#8217;s Santa Monica used its entertainment talent and posted a YouTube video with a love ballad written and performed by part time city employee and aspiring songwriter Jeff Stevens. Palo Alto also used song and dance to appeal to Google; with city residents and employees videotaping themselves dancing to the Village People&#8217;s YMCA. Oklahoma City took a more tech-friendly approach, crowdsourcing ideas for catching Google&#8217;s attention.  North Carolina&#8217;s Asheville passed a proclamation that 1:30 PM EST today would be the city&#8217;s &#8220;Google Moment.&#8221; At that time, everyone in the city is encouraged to submit online applications on Google&#8217;s broadband site. At the same time. Greenville, South Carolina recruited citizens to spell out Google with color coded glow sticks. Peoria, Illinois created this cartoon. Other cities have incorporated their natural resources and even animals into their bids to win Google&#8217;s attention. In addition to his parody video, Deluth&#8217;s mayor also jumped in the icy Lake Superior in the middle of winter. The mayor of Sarasota, Florida jumped into a shark tank to promote the city and renamed the city &#8220;Google Island.&#8221; Madison, Wisconsin (a state that is famous for its dairy products), has created a &#8220;Google Flavored&#8221; ice cream that includes M&amp;M&#8217;s in the same colors as Google&#8217;s logo and granola to represent fiber. So who will win the golden ticket? Digital communications and measurement firm Steketee Greiner and Co. has been analyzing over 90 cities across the US, measuring activity around online conversation, digital syndication, presence, involvement and activation, to determine which city will come out on top. At the moment, Steketee reports that Duluth seems to be in first place, with Grand Rapids taking second, Topeka coming in third place, Fresno in fourth place and Sarasota rounding out with the fifth spot. Of course, the U.S. government has its own ten year broadband plan, which among other goals, wants to subsidize broadband connections in rural areas, and bring 1-gigabit connections to every community in the U.S. While this is a worthy and necessary set of goals, there are a number of flaws with the strategy, namely that the plans aren&#8217;t ambitious enough. For example, under the new plan, some 85% of homes covered would have no choice when it comes to a provider, possibly locking users into higher prices because of a lack of competition.Google represents a small beacon of hope in that it could provide a concrete example for other communities or broadband providers to follow. While initially the search giant is only outfitting 500,000 homes, if the plan works, Google could end up expanding the project nationally.  And while it&#8217;s still unclear when Google will roll out its test implementations, the expectation is that it won&#8217;t take ten years.

       "  'comments_content': 'There&#8217;s no denying that Windows Phone 7 (or Windows Phone 7 Series, or whatever awful branding was chosen) looks to be a huge improvement from the previous iterations of Windows Mobile. And there&#8217;s even some talk that it may be able to compete with the current golden boy of the smartphone industry, Apple&#8217;s iPhone. If an early look at the new Foursquare app for Windows Phone 7 is any indication, it just may.As shown off by Windows Phone Senior Product Manager Anand Iyer on his blog this morning, Foursquare for Windows Phone 7 looks amazing. In fact, it looks much nicer than theÂ\\xa0recently-revamped version of Foursquare for the iPhone. As you can see in the screenshots, the app has a simple elegance to it, with most of the app being made of different color text against a black background (just about the opposite of Foursquare for the iPhone). Also nice is the maps (Bing, naturally) implementation on the check-in pages, venue pages, and individuals&#8217; profiles.The Windows Phone 7 version also has two killer features that the iPhone version of Foursquare does not: directions within the app, and a new &#8220;Society&#8221; area. The directions element is great â\\x80\\x94 it seems like daily I&#8217;m looking at a Foursquare venue on a map in the app that I&#8217;m trying to get to, but would love access to step-by-step directions. To get that on the iPhone, I have to exit the app and open the Maps app. On Windows Phone 7, it&#8217;s all integrated into the app.The new Society area, meanwhile, uses Foursquare&#8217;s firehose of data to show the hottest areas in a given city. It does this by showing you a heat map indicating where the most check-ins are taking place. You can then see pins showing the different venues in that area. And below that is a list of the venues and tallies for how many people are checking-in there.Obviously, this is just one app, and we&#8217;re still a long ways away from Windows Phone 7 launching (next Fall). But consider that Android has been out for a year and a half now, and there are still no Twitter apps for the platform that can touch the top five or so iPhone Twitter apps (though Seesmic is finally getting close). If the first attempt at Foursquare for Windows Phone 7 trumps the iPhone version, that would seem to be a good sign. Of course, it must be noted that third-party developers make the Twitter iPhone apps, and have also made this Foursquare app for WP7 â\\x80\\x94 meanwhile, it was Foursquare that made its own iPhone app. That said, there are others making Foursquare apps for the iPhone now, but none come close to being as nice as the WP7 one shown here.

In fact, the service has crossed 1.5 million users. And it&#8217;s gaining them at an incredible rate of 130,000 new users a week. Compare this to Foursquare, which during SXSW crossed 600,000 total users. And MyTown is showing no signs of slowing down, with another new version of the app now available.MyTown 3.0 comes just two months after the launch of MyTown 2.0. Â\\xa0The easiest way to think about the game is as a sort of real world Monopoly for the iPhone. You travel around your city and check-in places, gain points, and then decide which properties to virtually buy. While no one could argue that MyTown hasn&#8217;t been a fun and addicting game, previously, it was largely a solitary game. With this latest version, Booyah pumps up the social aspect.Now, like the aforementioned Foursquare and Gowalla, you can see a stream of your friends&#8217; check-ins. But it&#8217;s more than that. Staying true to their game-centric roots, you can also travel to friends&#8217; towns and view their properties and upgrades. There is also a new way to easily message friends, through a new contact list which can be built with Facebook Connect (or email contact import). And yes, there are now leaderboards to show how you&#8217;re doing in the game versus your friends.Another important social element is the ability to send virtual gifts to friends. Virtual items are a big part of MyTown, and the service offers a unique blend of items you can buy with virtual (fake) currency, as well as real currency via in-app purchases.It was only this past January that MyTown announced they had hit 500,000 users. Now just two months later, they&#8217;ve tripled in size. Being featured in the App Store undoubtedly has helped this growth (and now many of the other location players are being featured as well). But perhaps more impressively, users on MyTown are averaging around 70 minutes of playtime a day, we&#8217;re told. Equally impressive: MyTown is opened 850,000 times a day. Maybe it&#8217;s time to start wondering if MyTown is quietly becoming the Farmville of location-based gaming?Find MyTown in the App Store here. It is a free download.CrunchBase Information',\n",

In the years before the acquisition, Plaxo had to deal with criticisms for making it overly easy to accidentally spam your friends with your contact information, and later got into hot water with some of its screen scraping techniques. But the service has cleaned up its act, and continues to work at making managing your contacts less of a hassle (a problem that is only getting worse with the popularity of social networks, not better).This isn&#8217;t the only recent personnel change at Plaxo â\\x80\\x94 last December, Plaxo CTO Joseph Smarr left to join Google.Before joining Plaxo in early 2005, Golub served as SVP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs for VeriSign.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It&#8217;s a very well funded company that, despite a huge growth in user numbers and a number of product releases, has been getting some bad press on their lack of monetization and for not having a clear direction &#8211; though if you follow the product releases and the company&#8217;s hiring habits, there is a roadmap.However Tuenti has now launched what it deems to be their most strategic move yet &#8211; tapping into their social graph to introduce location-based features. The launch is a beta, still lacking some oomph perhaps, but it&#8217;s interesting to pick over what they&#8217;ve done. Especially as everyone is expecting Facebook to do the same at some point.The social network&#8217;s users have always been able to share places they identify with. Currently 3 million users have shared over 3,200 places. But the social network is now introducing Tuenti Places (reads &#8220;Tuenti  Sitios&#8221; in Spanish) as a global feature, where the entireÂ\\xa0user-baseÂ\\xa0is able to add any local place, interact with it, share it with friends, upload images and write reviews.Unlike Facebook pages, Tuenti Places are&#8230;well&#8230;places (bars, clubs, restaurants) and once a place is uploaded, there will be no room for duplicates. Each place will have its own unique space for user interaction. Valuable data if  you get tens of thousands of users interacting with that page.It&#8217;s a very different strategy from the likes of Gowalla or Yelp or Foursquare or Spain&#8217;s 11870 who&#8217;ve built a community on top of local. Tuenti first built a massive  and incredibly segmented community and now they&#8217;re introducing local,  which in itself is social by nature, but they can build in local by  crowdsourcing their 8 million active users who are already sharing places.  &#8220;Other local social directories can crowdsource 1% of theirÂ\\xa0user-base,  whereas Tuenti can count on 100% user implication&#8221; says Product Manager  Rags Vadali (ex-Google).This is, potentially, a big deal. Why?Well, it means a whole new  direction for Tuenti that seemingly glues together all the pieces. They have massive amounts  of highlyÂ\\xa0dissectedÂ\\xa0user data whose interaction is growing exponentially  along with the needed mobile apps (both iPhone and Android). Overnight Tuenti promises to get thousands of very  dynamic local business pages and will shortly introduce new features  such as Foursquare-like check-ins. Plenty of nice ways to leverage and  monetize highly segmented local interaction.And yesterday Tuenti made the press with an unconfirmed 9 million euro capital increase, so they look like they have the cash to see it through too.Tuenti',\n",

       "  'comments_content': '[France] Paris-based startup Kwaga, which offers a semantic search-based solution to help manage email, has launched a new desktop widget.It replaces Kwaga&#8217;s existing Firefox add-on, which is being discontinued, following a 6 month Beta testing period that saw nearly 2 million emails analysed, says the company.Dubbed Kwaga BirdsEye, the Windows/Mac OS/Linux app keeps an eye on your in-box and attempts to single out the most important emails or the ones that require more immediate attention and flag these up while you work in other applications. The idea is that it negates the need or temptation to keep checking your email in situations where you&#8217;re waiting for a meeting time confirmation or for an answer to a question you&#8217;ve asked a colleague. It makes these intelligent guesses using the company&#8217;s semantic search technology.The semantic element comes into play in the way in which Kwaga tries to make the human readable emails into something that a computer can understand. It does this by analysing the title and body text of an email and automatically applying tags, presumably based on trigger words, such as labeling it a &#8216;meeting&#8217; or an &#8216;answer&#8217; or &#8216;request&#8217;, and so on.The desktop widget then aggregates the emails that the system deems as the most important, all within a nice UI with the labels, email title, time stamp, and excerpt prominently displayed.Kwaga BirdsEye, which is free for up-to five email addresses and available in English and French, currently works with Gmail only (both personal and Google Apps for your Domain). Yahoo email addresses should be supported in a couple of weeks, while a mobile app is also in the works, though the company doesn&#8217;t specify for what platform &#8211; iPhone anyone?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This is the year of Micro Four Thirds. While Nikon and Canon still haven&#8217;t dipped their toes in this pool, I think it&#8217;s time for the average camera user to look at these things seriously and the power and elegance captured in the E-PL1 &#8211; and the affordability captured in its $599 price tag. Features:12-megapixel LiveMOS sensorTruePic 5 image processor14-42mm lens includedFlashLive GuidePros:Live Guide makes good photos easierGreat size and weightGood video recordingCons:No optical viewfinderNo stereo audio recordingLighter body materialsPanasonic and Olympus have been riding the M4/3 train for quite a while now and each new device they&#8217;ve released has been met with resounding claxons of joy and then disappointment as photobloggers find and focus on the limitations of the format. I&#8217;m pleased to report, then, that the E-PL1, is one of the first M4/3 cameras that I could see using as a secondary shooter instead of &#8211; or as a back-up to &#8211; a DSLR.First, what is M4/3? It is, in short, a lens format based on the four thirds system that does not, in most cases, use the same mirror or prism set-up found in most DSLRs. Think of it as a more powerful point and shoot, like the Canon G11, but with changeable lenses.I shot with the E-PL1 for a few weeks and I found it to be a great portable camera. The kit lens is great for general shooting and the 17mm is a great for portraits and wider angle shots, depending on how you frame the scene. The real value, however, comes in the Live Guide. The Live Guide is a quick help system that changes your image on the fly by modifying aperture and focus. Using it, you can:Change Color SaturationChange Color ImageChange BrightnessBlur BackgroundExpress MotionEach of these features acts in real time. Blur Background, for example, gives you a nice bokeh effect in headshots while Express Motion adds motion trails to swiftly moving objects. All of these features change on the screen as you modify them. The sliders allow you to set multiple features and an onscreen guide explains how each function works.Why is this important? Because as point-and-shoot photographers begin to explore new tools, they want to recreate the photos they see in magazines and are frustrated when they shoot with standard cameras (take a look at this Answers thread. Depth of field? Aperture? What is this demonry!) A small, cheap M4/3 can do many of these tricks and using art and scene modes you can add even more to your shots.The E-PL1 falls somewhere between a Canon EOS Rebel and a G11 or, on the Nikon side, the something like the D5000 and the Coolpix P6000. It is decidedly an odd duck. Interchangeable lenses may put off some purchasers who are unsure if they want to maintain a relationship with Olympus on the long term, but presumably you can swap out lenses as more powerful M4/3 cameras come out. Obviously this lock-in is what Olympus wants but, in a way, I could see this as a second system to use alongside a more formal DSLR set-up.How is shooting with the E-PL1? First, this camera is small and light enough to carry in a bag or purse, which makes it a great solution. The 17mm lens is flat as a pancake and the majority of scenes you&#8217;ll encounter on your way can be captured by it or the kit lens with aplomb. Take this shot, for example, taken in full sunlight against a colorful background. There is a bit of a blow-out on the face but it&#8217;s a nice enough shot. In direct sunlight you get some nice effects although there is some noise in slightly less well-lit shots, as we see below (taken with the 17mm).Finally, there are wide angle shots taken with the kit lens. Click on the small image to see an example showcasing the haze of New York.I really enjoyed shooting with this camera, even without an optical viewfinder. You can purchase a viewfinder and stereo microphone for the E-PL1 but working directly on the screen was not the exercise in frustration I thought it would be. Folks used to the optical viewfinder will definitely be put off by the E-PL1 at first, but I got over it. I did, however, consistently bring the camera to my face when first started using it.In short, this camera is perfect for those who don&#8217;t want to lug around a heavier DSLR but still want to get some great shots. I worry a bit about durability, especially given the lighter composite materials used for the body, but that&#8217;s nothing a good, small camera bag can&#8217;t fix. While it won&#8217;t replace the shutter bug&#8217;s favorite piece of big glass, the E-PL1 is definitely worth some consideration.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1 {\\t\\t\\t\\tmargin: auto;\\t\\t\\t}\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1 .gallery-item {\\t\\t\\t\\tfloat: left;\\t\\t\\t\\tmargin-top: 10px;\\t\\t\\t\\ttext-align: center;\\t\\t\\t\\twidth: 25%;\\t\\t\\t}\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1 img {\\t\\t\\t\\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\\t\\t\\t}\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {\\t\\t\\t\\tmargin-left: 0;\\t\\t\\t}',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Advertisers are beginning to realize that ads on the Web have their own lifecycle.  People who eventually click on an ad don&#8217;t always click on it the first time they see it.  Just like on TV or in print, they need to be bombarded by the same message before they take an action.  The more times people see an ad on the Web, the more likely they are to eventually click on it.  As annoying as this may be to most consumers, this is how advertisers view the world.Google also sees the world through this lens, and today it fully launched what it calls ad &#8220;retargeting.&#8221;  If someone visits a page on an advertiser&#8217;s own site or YouTube channel, Google can now show a related follow-up ad to just that person when they visit another site which shows Google ads.  Since there are millions of sites in the Google Content Network, chances are Google will see them again.  The program has been in beta since March, but it is now being rolled out to all AdWords customers.The term &#8220;remarketing&#8221; has multiple definitions, but Google uses it describe a way for AdWords advertisers to run campaigns throughout the Google Content Network, which the company claims reaches about 80% of Internet users around the globe. The idea is that while visitors of a certain advertiser&#8217;s website may have shown interest for a product or service, leads don&#8217;t always convert to sales and Google aims to make it easier for AdWords clients to try and win over the potential customer at a later stage.  Retargeting can be applied to either text or display ads, and during the trial period was used for everything from boosting brand awareness to driving clicks and sales.For example, a hotel site could retarget offers for Caribbean hotels to people who visited their Caribbean hotels section after they leave their site.  Maybe if you are reminded that there is a special deal for a week-long stay in St. Barts when you are on a blog or news site, you will finally click on that ad and book the trip.  That&#8217;s the hope behind retargeting.  It will work for a small percentage of people who need that extra nudge.  For everybody else it will just seem creepy.  If this does creep you out, you can go to this page to see what Google thinks your interests are based on a cookie, and you can also opt out entirely if you&#8217;re spooked about Google&#8217;s latest &#8216;interest-based advertising&#8217; initiatives.',\n",

Now Chyngle has partnered with mobiTeris to rebrand and reinvent its application as CrowdZone, a free iPhone app that acts as a mobile social network for crowds at sporting events. CrowdZone&#8217;s app allows users to &#8220;join&#8221; a crown or start a crowd around a sports event. While the app is location-based, you can also participate from your coach and can use the app&#8217;s functionality even if you aren&#8217;t at a particular event. Within a crowd in the app, you can check-in to a game, similar to a check-in on popular mobile social network Foursquare. Once you&#8217;ve checked in, you can see other people who are using the app and where they are located in the crowd.  You can share comments and pictures with your crowds and participate in &#8220;fan activities,&#8221; such as cheers or the wave. And as you participate in the application, you earn activity points and badges, with the aim of achieving the &#8220;Crowd MVP&#8221; status at an event. Although partnerships with sports teams and stadiums aren&#8217;t necessary for the app&#8217;s functionality, CrowdZone already has one professional sports team that is on board with its offering. The NHL&#8217;s Carolina Hurricanes will be promoting CrowdZone&#8217;s app to their fans through television and radio ads as well as on their Web site, Facebook and Twitter fan channels. Chyngle and CrowdZone&#8217;s co-founder Todd Sullivan says that revenue hasn&#8217;t been turned on yet, but the startup is looking to monetize the app in a variety of ways. Sullivan says that teams could possibly leverage a CrowdZone network to identify and message influential fans. Sullivan adds that CrowdZone also provides a channel for teams to engage in commerce with their fans around virtual and real-world goods. CrowdZoneâ\\x80\\x99s real-time analytics, generated from crowd behavioral and location data could provide teams with valuable insight. One of the biggest challenges CrowdZone will face is actually getting users to download and use the app. But if the startup continues to get endorsements and publicity from professional sports teams, the app could gain popularity as a niche mobile social network for die hard sports fans.

       "  'comments_content': 'Today, Bing is announcing more refinements to its search engine.  The most noticeable one is what Bing director Stefan Weitz unofficially calls the &#8220;Bing Box.&#8221;  For popular search categories such as celebrities, cities, companies, musicians, movies, places, and sports, the top result will be the Bing Box, which will pull in an image and a link to the official site, along with some relevant data.  For pop music star Lady Gaga, it might be concert dates and realtime Tweets.  For &#8220;Miami Beach,&#8221; it might be a thumbnail of a map, the current weather, flight deals, and a list of neighborhoods.The Bing Box is similar to Google&#8217;s Universal Search Onebox that pulls in images and results from different vertical search categories and places it at the top of the search results page.   But the Bing Box packages the data in a slightly different manner.  &#8220;That center search pane with a bunch of links is going to change,&#8221; predicts Weitz.Bing wants to compete against Google with a better presentation of information and design of the user experience.  In addition to the Bing Box, it is tweaking the guided search along the left-hand column.  It is getting rid of the drill-down search categories which currently appear in the prime top-left location.  Nobody was clicking on them.  Instead, different types of filters and related searches will appear there.  Weitz notes that related searches on Bing get a 16 percent click-through rate, and search history gets a 3 percent click-through rate.  So those two are staying.  Underneath the search bar will be a new set of tabs appropriate to the search term.  For a rock band, the tabs may include events, news, videos, and images.  While a search for a place will bring up tabs for maps, events, news and the weather.On Bing Maps, a new Foursquare app will show places where people have left comments and tips. The app will allow user to see Foursquare check-ins, badges, and mayorships  within a Bing Map. In addition, anyone will be able to see tips from any foursquare customer and zoom to the location for visualization.  Bing is also adding more eye-catching graphical elements to its autosuggest.  So stock charts and weather icons will begin to appear in the drop-down list of suggestions once you start typing your search query.  Weitz says that a whopping 30 percent of searches on Bing are already launched from the autosuggest feature.  Separately, a comparison feature will start to be rolled out as well for sports teams, presenting side-by-side stats in search results.  Finally, Bing is creating a dedicated page for all automobile searches, much like it already does for events and recipes.  The guided search on the left includes a breakdown by different trims, competitors, and model year.  While the new tabs on top will include images, videos, and specs.   Bing is building out more of these so-called domain task pages for different topics.  Later this year, videogame searches will get their own special treatment, with shortcuts to find cheats, walkthroughs, and reviews.  &#8220;There isnâ\\x80\\x99t another technology that is eight years old that you would be satisfied with,&#8221; says Weitz, referring to how little the search experience has changed since Google hit the scene and offered up its spare blue links.  As the Web moves away from being mostly just text to images, video, and rich pools of data, he thinks there are better ways to present that information in a way that reduces the work and effort required of the user.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'If there&#8217;s one thing putting a spring in the step of publishers this summer and giving them just a little more impetus to initiate summer hours and &#8220;get away from the hustle and bustle of the city&#8221; by having their driver take them to their house on the Hamptons, it&#8217;s the iPad. Is there anything this thing can&#8217;t do? Absolutely not, because publishers are flocking to it in droves in an effort to save their falling circulation numbers.To wit, the nut of this story is that the Wall Street Journal will cost $17.99 a month on the iPad, considerable savings over the $2 cover price. This subscription will presumably include all of the graphics and layouts that make the Journal famous as well as ads &#8211; lots of expensive, sweet ads. For example, &#8220;Unilever, Toyota Motor , Fidelity Investments&#8221; is paying Time magazine $200,000 for eight display ads in the iPages of Time magazine. That&#8217;s for eight issues, mind you, which breaks down to $25,000 an issue. $25,000 was probably the haircut budget for the ad staff at Time Inc. How can they buy a Ski-doo for their next Vail trip with that kind of money? I&#8217;m of two minds when it comes to who&#8217;s going to survive the death of print and the rise of the ereader. I think we&#8217;re on the an MP3-style cusp. These past few years, with the Kindle leading the charge, have been the Napster days of online reading. Back then, MP3s were exotic, odd, and hard to handle. Then Apple comes along and changes all that. Overnight, grandma is thinking about picking up the new Jennifer Crusie book on an ereader and now you&#8217;re going to have to tell her what to buy. And what are you going to tell her to buy? It won&#8217;t be the the Amazon&#8217;s version of the 2010 Rio Volt MP3 CD Player. It will be the shiny thing from Apple.That said, will the old brands make the move? Probably. I&#8217;d pay $1.99 for a new issue of GQ, for example, that I can read on the plane. Heck, I&#8217;d pay $19.99 for a 12-month subscription, just like I do in meatspace. And publishers will have a new set of metrics (and will probably discover that their circulations were vastly underreported.) I also thing sites like this one and big daddy TC will have a place at the table, although we haven&#8217;t yet picked out the China pattern or the menu. Thoughts?via WSJ',\n",

Dominant still is iPhone OS, which has increased its share of smartphone requests on the AdMob network from 33 percent in February 2009 to 50 percent in February 2010. Android, however, is the fastest-growing these days.Symbian is the big loser: while it accounted for 43% of AdMob&#8217;s smartphone requests in February 2009, it only reached a 18% share last month.AdMob also says Mobile Internet devices experienced the strongest growth compared to feature phones and smartphones, increasing to account for 17 percent of traffic in its network in February 2010. The iPod touch is the top mobile Internet device and is said to be responsible for a vast majority of this traffic; other devices include the Sony PSP and Nintendo DSi.For your reference: AdMob considers a smartphone to run an identifiable OS, a feature phone to be a mobile phone that does not fit into the smartphone category, and a mobile Internet device to be a handheld device that connects to the mobile Web but is not a phone.Other highlights from the February 2010 AdMob Mobile Metrics Report (PDF):- Symbian&#8217;s share of smartphone requests fell from 43 percent in February 2009 to 18 percent in February 2010.- Android increased its share from two percent in February 2009 to 24 percent in February 2010.- The top five Android devices worldwide, by traffic, were the Motorola Droid, HTC Dream, HTC Hero, HTC Magic, and the Motorola CLIQ.- The Google Nexus One only generated one percent of total Android traffic in February 2010.- Samsung, Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and LG were the top manufacturers of feature phones.(Via press release)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'From time to time, Apple posts about new positions on our CrunchBoard job board â\\x80\\x94 which we appreciate. For example, last December they posted an opening that seemed to suggest an expansion of iWork in the cloud. But today we noticed something rather interesting, Apple has posted several positions â\\x80\\x94 so many that they have completely taken over the job board widget that appears on TechCrunch. And all are centered around the App Store.This shouldn&#8217;t really come as a huge surprise to those who follow Apple. The much-hyped iPad device is set to launch on April 3, and with it will undoubtedly be an onslaught of new apps. In fact, it appears that the wait times for app reviews has been slipping substantially in recent days as developers are rushing to submit their iPad apps before the March 27 deadline (to be considered for an initial launch app) â\\x80\\x94 and it stands to reason that Apple is giving priority to iPad apps to get reviewed initially.It would seem that Apple is bracing itself to take the App Store to the next level with this new device.So what kinds of positions is Apple filling? Interestingly, most are editorial-based, meaning Apple is looking for people who can help distinguish the good apps for the bad ones, for promotion. For example, the Editorial Programmer, Apps should be someone who, &#8220;is responsible for the discovery, selection, and promotion of apps&#8221;. Other positions revolve around promoting the business behind the App Store.Something else interesting is that Apple is looking for people who can help with the &#8220;promotion of apps on the desktop as well device App Stores.&#8221; This suggests that Apple may in fact be thinking of an App Store idea for the Mac itself. The company recently launched a new Mac Developer Program similar to the one it offers for the iPhone (and now iPad).Three of the positions listed are also specifically related to game apps. Games have been the largest portion of the App Store for much of its existence, but were recently overtaken by books. But seeing as Apple is now doing its own book promotion via iBooks, games look to reign supreme again â\\x80\\x94 especially with the larger screen iPad. And clearly Apple knows this.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Silicon Valley and India have a cozy relationship, but a big question has resulted in friction, failed companies and millions in losses: When will the Internet catch on in India in a big way?A few companies have done well and a few more are coming up, slowly but surely. But there are hardly any true breakout hits.RedBus is pretty close. It&#8217;s essentially an Expedia for bus tickets in India. It sells about 3,500 bus seats per day, is the fourth most-trafficked Web site in India and has at least tripled its revenues year-over-year. The company sells seats for roughly half the bus operators in India, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s saying something: This is an insanely fragmented market that had next to zero centralization just a few years ago.Â\\xa0 All of this has been built in three years on about $1 million in venture funding. (The company raised another $1.3 million in 2008, but itâ\\x80\\x99s still in the bank. Investors include Helion, Inventus and Seedfund.)I can vouch for the company being cheap. Having spent my morning in the plush eight-acre Infosys headquarters, the offices of RedBus were a marked contrast. They are split among two buildings located in one of those very chaotic Indian neighborhoods where vendors are shouting, cows are wandering and smell of open sewers is not too far off. It feels far from the sanitized, steel-and-glass rows of multinationals.None of this is intended as an insult&#8211; co-founder and CEO Phanindra Sama is proud of his cheapness. (Sama is pictured above, sorry it&#8217;s so blurry. My camera was having issues.) We met in a no-frills, un-airconditioned conference room. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t turn on the air conditioning for famed Silicon Valley Indian entrepreneur Kanwal Rekhi, when he visited last month eitherâ\\x80\\x94and Rekhi is an investor in RedBus.Despite the sweat trickling down my forehead, arms, legs and back throughout the interview, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to leave. What Sama and his two founders have pulled off in a short period of time with little funding in India is impressive.Background for Americans: There are two kinds of buses in Indiaâ\\x80\\x94those that make stops and have ticket-takers on board and that go to one destination only and sell pre-paid tickets only. There are some 3,000 operators of the latter category and, before RedBus, there was no way to contact them directly. To get a bus ticket, you went to an agent. That agent only had inventory from a few bus lines. To book the ticket, he or she would call one person who was in charge of booking every seat on that particular route. There was a long wait time, and frequently the routes the agents knew about were sold out â\\x80\\x93 meaning you had to change your travel plans, or find another agent who had different sources. Meanwhile there was no standardization on pricing and commissions. The agent simply wrote the cost on a piece of paper and if you wanted to ride, you paid it.Now, RedBus has a central database that gets seats from half of India&#8217;s bus operators. It has done so well that it powers the bus ticket applications for most of India&#8217;s more general travel sites like MakeMyTrip.com. It also sells an OpenTable-like software-as-a-service product to help bus companies manage their own inventory and better integrate their inventory with RedBus. In terms of seats, it sells less than 1% of the 750,000 rides taken daily, but with several channels and few other easy options, there&#8217;s a ton of room to grow a big company.Sama didnâ\\x80\\x99t set out to build a company. I know thatâ\\x80\\x99s a clichÃ© with startups these days, but itâ\\x80\\x99s a rarity in Bangalore where the glamor of being a Web entrepreneur runs high and plenty of TechCrunch-reading kids save up money, quit for a year, try to start a company, and go back to a multinational if it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hit quickly. When RedBusâ\\x80\\x99s mentor first suggested the company raise $1 million, Sama gasped. He hadnâ\\x80\\x99t even thought in those amounts. His only immediate thought was: â\\x80\\x9cIf I had $1 million, Iâ\\x80\\x99d put it in the bank and make interest.&#8221;That mentor was Sanjay Anandaram formerly of Neta, Wipro and other ventures known between the Silicon Valley and Indian entrepreneur communities. Sama met Anandaram through TIEâ\\x80\\x99s JumpStartUp program. Despite the reach, influence and press of TIEâ\\x80\\x94the uber-Indian networking organization started in the Valleyâ\\x80\\x94 Sama is the first entrepreneur Iâ\\x80\\x99ve met in India who gives it this much credit for his companyâ\\x80\\x99s survival.Specifically, he cites Anandaramâ\\x80\\x99s advice. When RedBus was trying to sell software to the bus lines, it was Anandaram who said: Donâ\\x80\\x99t keep trying to sell the same thing, ask what they need and build that. The bus lines needed to sell seats. So RedBus built a site, and bought the inventory itself from the bus lines to list on the site. Once it proved it could move seats, the operators were happy to pay the company a percentage of seats sold.Once the company could prove results, it was Anandaram who warned them to undersell expectations: Tell an operator you can sell one seat for them a month, even if you think you can sell fifty. If you sell two, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be a hero, not a disappointment. RedBus has carried that over to fundraising, admittedly forgoing higher valuations because it didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to oversell and under-deliver.Thatâ\\x80\\x99s harder than it sounds for an entrepreneur, who is usually the single most bullish person on his company. And it is absolutely shocking in Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s startup culture. I had a blog network tell me on my last morning in India â\\x80\\x93 with a straight face â\\x80\\x93 that it would be doing double the revenues of Gawker in a few years. I like to give entrepreneurs the benefit of the doubt, but I also know the media business. Forgive the generalization, but Indians just love to over-sell. Itâ\\x80\\x99s deep in their trader heritage. â\\x80\\x9cYou have to sacrifice your ego,â\\x80\\x9d Sama says.But, especially for a startup in India, the most important piece of advice Sama and his co-founders got from Anandaram might have been this: You are not an Internet company. Because the Internet isnâ\\x80\\x99t more widespread in India, there has to be a core mindset that the Net is an important channel, but just a channel. Just under 50% of RedBusâ\\x80\\x99s business comes from the Net, much of the rest is via mobile phones.And the company invested early in two expensive ways of skirting that Web limitation. The first was building its own network of bike couriers to deliver tickets and take payments, ala the hugely successful Chinese online travel company, CTrip. The second was investing in seven different call centers throughout India, not one central call center. Says Sama, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t localize a call center to local slang, languages, and customs the customer service wonâ\\x80\\x99t work.Seriously? An Indian in Bangalore arguing a centralized, remote call center canâ\\x80\\x99t give good customer service? That has about as much globalization-irony as China&#8217;s BYD refusing to outsource any of its manufacturing.For Anandaramâ\\x80\\x99s part he noted the foundersâ\\x80\\x99 willingness to listen and learn from someone who&#8217;d been there. He says the biggest mistakes he sees Indian startups making are not seeking advice, being too obsessed with retaining control and not valuing sales, marketing and partnerships.The RedBus story squares with something Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been noticing more in my travels to emerging marketsâ\\x80\\x94frequently when entrepreneurs complain about a lack of angel investing or venture capital, what they are really lacking isnâ\\x80\\x99t just the money, itâ\\x80\\x99s the mentorship. This came up in my recent conversation with Pierre Omidyar, whose philanthropic effort, the Omidyar Network, seeks to fund both non-profit and for profit entrepreneurs specifically those in the poorest areas of the world. Omidyar Networks has money it can gives these entrepreneurs, thanks to eBay and the dot com boomâ\\x80\\x94lots of money. But what the organization is increasingly finding so lacking is that horrible buzz word â\\x80\\x9chuman capital.â\\x80\\x9dIn Omidyarâ\\x80\\x99s own experience, eBay never touched the $3 million it raised from Benchmark in 1996. But the mentorship he got was well worth giving up 25% of the company. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what is so hard to find around the world,â\\x80\\x9d Omidyar says. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re increasingly looking at whether $500,000 worth of human capital could help more than $500,000.â\\x80\\x9dI know that the idea the VCs bring more than money is ridiculed by most entrepreneurs today, but those are usually entrepreneurs operating in a scene that has had an explosion of startupsâ\\x80\\x94both failed and successful onesâ\\x80\\x94in the last fifteen years. Even the shiest, most awkward or most unconnected entrepreneurs in the Valley can find a mentor with little effort. Sometimes we take for granted that thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the case in much of the rest of the world.Lucky for RedBus&#8217;s founders, they were an exception.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Dear AT&amp;T, Yes, it&#8217;s me. Again. But today, rather than just bitching about your service, I have a solution for you. In fact, it&#8217;s so obvious, and makes so much sense, that I can&#8217;t believe you didn&#8217;t think of it. So I&#8217;m going to help you out.Today, you announced the nationwide rollout plans for your new 3G MicroCell product. That&#8217;s great. It sounds like a great solution for those customers who have poor reception in their home or work environments. I know many of those customers. In fact, just about everyone I know in San Francisco and New York City who has AT&amp;T service is one of the customers. In fact, I&#8217;m one of those customers. So yes, I want this device. But seeing as I&#8217;ve been paying you about $100-a-month for several years now, I think it&#8217;s only fair that you pay for it.It would be one thing if my service was only poor a few times a year. Hell, maybe I&#8217;d even be okay if it were bad a few times a month. But every single day I have some kind of AT&amp;T issue. And many of the aforementioned people I know do too. So rather than making us pay the $150 for this device, why not just send one to every customer living in areas that you yourselves admit has service &#8220;below our standards&#8220;?Yes, I know that&#8217;s an expensive proposition. But think of what a PR win that would be after months of being dragged through the mud. And is $150 really that much to eat in the long run? Again, we&#8217;re paying you nearly that much every single month. And while you may admit that the service isn&#8217;t where it should be, I have yet to see a refund check in the mail. Other services, like Netflix, proactively apologize and give refunds when their service fails. You do nothing except promise that things will get better. We&#8217;ve been hearing that promise for years now. It hasn&#8217;t gotten better.The only reason I don&#8217;t switch carriers is because of the amazing gift you were given: the iPhone. I understand that demand for that device is the reason your network is so terrible. But that&#8217;s your problem, not mine.Following your great performance at SXSW this year (after last year&#8217;s disaster), I wondered aloud why you couldn&#8217;t do the same thing here that you did there? I understand there are a few reasons (the biggest of which seems to be that it would be more difficult â\\x80\\x94 which to me, seems mainly to mean that it would cost more money), but this seems like a perfect temporary solution. And I&#8217;m hardly the only one who thinks so.So think about it, will you? You have an amazing opportunity to do the right thing here.Oh, and P.S. I forgot to mention maybe the biggest benefit to you too â\\x80\\x94 because you&#8217;re offloading traffic from your large macro-cells to these micro-cells using broadband we already pay for, you&#8217;re going to be freeing up a lot of bandwidth, allowing the overall network to improve.See, it&#8217;s a win-win. It just needs to be a free option in the areas where you are currently failing.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The momentum in online advertising is shifting away fromÂ\\xa0traditionalÂ\\xa0static text ads and towards rich media ads that are highly customized and interactive. Unfortunately, they generally take a lot more effort to create, which puts them out of reach for some companies. Â\\xa0Enter Widgetbox&#8217;s ClickTurn ad-builder. ClickTurnÂ\\xa0gives publishers a relatively fast and easy way to create dynamic ads with multiple tabs that include content from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook streams. Think of it as a mini site-within-a site where advertisers can showcase their best content and social media feeds.ClickTurn has delivered over 100 million impressions so far, collecting a $1.50 CPM. Not too shabby, when you consider that ClickTurn launched in December and has 12 clients under contract (including CBS, IDG, Linkedin).For publishers, why bother? Publishers want advertisers, advertisers want eyeballs, rich media ads attract more eyeballs. For comparison, the traditional display ad will see a 0.13% click-through rate and a 2% engagement rate (i.e. when a cursor floats over the ad), according to Widgetbox CEO, Will Price. Meanwhile, ClickTurn&#8217;s ads enjoy a 0.8% click-through rate  with a 20-25% engagement rate.There are other companies in this space like EyeWonder, Point Roll and Eyeblaster. Price says the rich ad process typically requires a flash developer and 4-6 weeks on average&#8212; making it a costly and labor intensive endeavor. Price says that anyone that can navigate Facebook can create an ad with ClickTurn&#8217;s template in half an hour. Using ClickTurn&#8217;s form, a user can pick custom backgrounds, select a size, add animation and create tabs with social media streams or other information/multimedia. There&#8217;s also an option to add a companion mobile ad (publishers can include an input field at the foot of their ad for user cell phone numbers). When a user enters his number, the ad sends a link via text message that will open a complementary mobile ad that uses HTML5 to present a more dynamic experience.The rich media ad industry is still relatively small. Of the web&#8217;s $7.4 billion display ad market, just $1 billion is rich media. But it&#8217;s rapidly expanding as advertisers demand a more customized feel and higher audience engagement. And it&#8217;s about more than just clicks. The real value of a rich media ad is hidden in the treasure trove of user data. While a typical display ad can tell you the number of impressions, a service like ClickTurn can tell you how a user is interacting with your ad and which tabs/services are most popular (i.e. if users prefer your Facebook or YouTube stream). It&#8217;s a window into your consumer, their online habits and a way to gauge the success of your social media strategy.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yishan Wong, who has played a key role in growing Facebook into the social networking juggernaut it is today, is leaving the company, we&#8217;ve learned and confirmed with a Facebook spokesperson. People come and go all the time of course, but Wong&#8217;s departure is noteworthy because he has managed quite some important engineering projects at Facebook over the past few years.Wong joined Facebook in late 2005 as a software engineer after a prior 4.5 year stint as senior engineering director at PayPal. As he once wrote on his personal website, the engineering department back then was only 30 people strong (there are several hundreds now), and Wong worked his way up to Director of Engineering until voluntarily scaling back a bit last year.Wong played an instrumental role in Facebook&#8217;s (frequently lauded) internationalization efforts &#8211; he came up with the idea for crowd-sourcing translations and is credited as an inventor on multiple patents related to those initiatives. As Director of Engineering, he also oversaw the Ads and Payments teams, where the self-serve ads system that makes Facebook so much money today was built &#8211; though the ill-fated Beacon project was also developed on his watch.Furthermore, the Platform team and what one would now refer to as the Applications team (photos, events, groups, notes, inbox, chat, etc.) also reported to Wong for some time, and he spent a lot of his time assisting in the recruitment of people (he&#8217;s the original author of Facebook Puzzles, for example) and mentoring new managers who joined the company over the years. Most recently, he was involved on mobile-related developments at Facebook, including the Location efforts that are currently in the works.So why is Wong leaving and what&#8217;s next? From what we can gather, this particular departure involves not an ounce of drama (regretful, we know) and although he&#8217;s been with the company for quite some time he&#8217;ll be mostly missed over there for the stuff he&#8217;s done in the past and his personality. Today is his last day at the office, and we hear he&#8217;ll be working on a project of his own for the foreseeable future.(Picture via Dave McClure)CrunchBase Information',\n",

After all, it put it on my radar, and after trying out the engine, it seems very, very solid. It&#8217;s a simple engine that doesn&#8217;t clutter its pages with unnecessary results. It offers tailored results for regular search as well as information, and shopping results. And, for the adventurous types, there&#8217;s an &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling ducky&#8221; button. And, unlike Google, the service says it keeps no information from its searches.Perhaps even more interesting, DuckDuckGo is the work of one man, Gabriel Weinberg, a former co-founder of NamesDatabase (which sold to Classmates.com in 2006).

So far, aside from a few networks in the U.S. testing out pulling in tweets to augment the watching of some reruns, and even a new show based on a Twitter account, we haven&#8217;t heard too much more about it. There was, for example, no Twitter reality show. But actually, there is a Twitter televison show. It&#8217;s just in Spain.As Twitter&#8217;s new VP of Communications tweeted out recently, Twision is a Spanish show that debuted on the channel Veo7 last week. While it doesn&#8217;t exactly have a prime time slot (it&#8217;s on at midnight), it&#8217;s an hour-long program that lets viewers send in tweets live that two hosts then interact with. The Spanish site Terra has a bit more (translated).As you can see from this site hosted by Veo7, the show takes place in a studio with two guys on laptops and a huge screen behind them to showcase tweets. The anchors also show videos and other content as shared on Twitter to talk about. The site features a stream of tweets coming in next to the video player.

       "  'comments_content': 'This morning, numerous British newspapers and tabloids (followed by a wave of bloggers) reported that Facebook use had been &#8220;linked to a rise in Syphilis&#8221; in a number of cities in the UK.  That&#8217;s certainly an attention-grabbing headline, but Facebook users out there may want to think twice before putting any weight into the claim.  For starters, the article in The Telegraph, which appears to be among the first publications to have broken the news, gets off to a bad start: it says that Syphilis is caused by a virus (it&#8217;s actually a bacterial infection â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0I knew my biology degree would come in handy one day!). But more importantly, the story&#8217;s facts are nebulous at best.For one, the articles in question say that the number of Syphilis infections in the English town of Teesside has grown to a whopping thirty cases in 2009 (up from a mere ten cases the previous year). Sure, that&#8217;s a big jump percentage-wise, but the small sample size and the complete lack of details about any of these studies makes the conclusion that Facebook can somehow be linked to Syphilis extremely dubious.All of the articles quote the same person: Professor Peter Kelly, director of Public Health for NHS Tees, and none of the quotes seem to contain anyÂ\\xa0concreteÂ\\xa0evidence.Â\\xa0Here&#8217;s a sample quote taken from The Sun that doesn&#8217;t exactly inspire confidence (yes, I know it&#8217;s a tabloid, but it has more quotes than the other articles):&#8220;I don&#8217;t get the names of people affected, just figures. And I saw that several of the people had met sexual partners through these sites. Social networking sites are making it easier for people to meet up for casual sex. There is a rise in syphilis because people are having more sexual partners than 20 years ago and often do not use condoms.&#8221;This sounds more like an observation based on a small number of cases rather than an established trend, and it doesn&#8217;t say anything about causation.  I&#8217;m hardly the first to notice this â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Dr. Petra Boynton of the UK has written a detailed blog post outlining the lack of evidence cited in the report, and Dr. Ben Goldacre is trying to gather more details from the NHS (which has gone silent, according to his Twitter posts).  The Guardian has pointed out the weakness of the claims as well.We reached out to Facebook for their stance. Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes gave us this statement:While it makes for interesting headlines, the assertions made in newspaper reports that Facebook is responsible for the transmission of STDs are ridiculous, exaggerate the comments made by the professor, and ignore the difference between correlation and causation.  As Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s more than 400 million users know, our Web site is not a place to meet people for casual sex â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s a place for friends, family and coworkers to connect and share.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'If you follow e-readers, you might have seen the post I wrote not long ago detailing and judging the various secondary features e-readers are sporting in order to catch the eye of the spendy book-lover. I am ashamed to say I missed a very important one: extremely low price. I mentioned it in passing, but the truth is that once a device like this creeps below $100 or so while retaining its fundamental function, it gains access to a few different markets, a circumstance worth looking at.The Kobo e-reader is the spark that set this post off; at $150, this 6&#8243;-screen, 0.1&#8243;-thin, half-pound device is among the very cheapest e-readers out there, yet Kobo also runs its own bookstore, which has the usual classics and bestsellers &mdash; probably 90% of what gets sold for e-readers. It&#8217;s going to be sold at Borders, and with its modest price tag might make for more of a temptation to browsing customers.But as long as consumers are being bombarded with promises of Android, touchscreens, cool dual-screen form factors, the Kobo is going to look mighty shabby in comparison. And by the time Kobo gets some press and is widely available, we&#8217;ll probably be hearing about all the cool stuff that&#8217;s going to happen next year. What&#8217;s a cheap, functional e-reader to do?Sell in bulk. The e-book is a loss leader, right? If someone spends $150 on a reader, you can be sure they&#8217;re going to get their money&#8217;s worth by buying at the very least 10 or 20 books and magazines a year with the thing. I don&#8217;t know why more e-readers aren&#8217;t being sold at or below cost. Sony made the same mistake with the PS3 &mdash; if they truly had a &#8220;10-year plan&#8221; for their device, why were they so chary of losing money at launch? Nobody is going to buy a PS3 and no games, and nobody is going to buy an e-reader and no books. We talked in the podcast about the Alex and things like co-branding with publishers and subscription models. I think that in the coming tablet wars, the only way e-books will be able to stay above water is with volume. And in order to have volume, they&#8217;re going to need to be able to make a real value proposition when there&#8217;s an iPad or Chrome OS tablet in their customer&#8217;s hand. As much as I like the Que, for instance, few will buy one at $650 when you can get a tablet computer for far less. Sure, they don&#8217;t do the same things exactly, but tell that to the consumer looking at full-color e-books on the iPad and desktop-class web apps in Chrome OS. There&#8217;s only one thing to do: get them prices down!E-reader sellers have been living in a land of milk and honey for the last year; although their devices are yet unfamiliar to most people and probably aren&#8217;t selling as well as anyone hoped, they were a class to themselves and people justified spending $350 because &#8220;that&#8217;s just how much these things cost.&#8221; This year should change that, and the iPad&#8217;s strong sales should strike fear into e-readers&#8217; hearts. Amazon is already hedging its bets.What to do? Are they doomed? Hell no. But you better believe they&#8217;re going to be niche a year or so from now. Once the place of the tablet in a person&#8217;s tech lifestyle is established, I personally think people will find room for an e-reader, but it&#8217;s going to be hard to justify spending a lot. To return to the Kobo, however, a cheap device that replaces a whole class of paper books and mass-photocopied lecture notes could be a breakthrough for a University. English majors could probably get by with the 100 free books that come pre-loaded on the thing. Or a teacher-administrated set of locked Kobos in a middle school classroom &mdash; no more dog-eared copies of Where the Red Fern Grows: &#8220;Choose two heart-rending dog stories from the eight available on your Kobos, children. Your progress will be monitored &mdash; and your tears.&#8221;Seriously, though. Kobo, being first and foremost the cheap, basic option out there, should capitalize on that &mdash; as far as one can capitalize on being inexpensive. Call up school districts, libraries, universities, and hey why not, government agencies. Think of the amount of paper used in duplicating bills and memos for interns and editors to read! Of course, if any great amount of marking up is required, that&#8217;s a bust for the Kobo, which has very little in terms of input, but it still could be very useful in the right situations. They&#8217;ve also got apps for the major smartphone platforms, which is a good selling point for big, homogeneous groups like enterprise and government.The thing is that Kobo needs to bite the bullet and start selling these things for peanuts. If they want to get a leg up on the other e-readers, to say nothing of survive the onslaught of tablets, they need to get a million units out there stat. Apple&#8217;s got a 10-iPads-for-$4970 deal right now, but to outfit a class of freshmen at that price would bankrupt Croesus. But if Kobo calls up UCLA and says &#8220;Psst &#8211; special deal for you, my friend, Kobo eighty dollars, you buy at my store,&#8221; I think they can guarantee themselves quite a few sales, though it may mean a lot of work by some party in localizing lecture notes and so on to the e-book format. If the state or city won&#8217;t bite, then offer deep student discounts. Just get them out there.The gist is this: the only way e-readers are going to stay healthy a year from now is by either being one of the few leading brands (Kindle, nook, etc) who can sell at a premium, or by selling their product in thousand-packs for deep discounts. Schools are the obvious target for this kind of sales tactic, but like the Alex, Kobo could also work with publishers and stores to re-brand and customize, as they&#8217;re likely doing with Borders. Of course, at this point it&#8217;s still speculation and guesswork as to the buying patterns of the book-buying public, so we&#8217;ll see how it turns out, but for a non-premium device like the Kobo, I think the course is clear.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Startup Wix, which allows users to build flash websites and widgets, has just raised $10 million in Series C funding from Benchmark Capital existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners and Mangrove Capital Partners participating. This round of founding brings Wix&#8217;s total funding to $20 million.  You can read our initial review of Wix here. Founded in 2006, Wix provides a simple mechanism for anyone to create Flash-based websites and widgets without losing SEO juice.  Users can customize their Wix websites with a drag and drop editing tool and pretty templates, making the site user-friendly for users who may not be tech savvy. The funding will be used for further product development. The site makes its money from a freemium model where users pay for extra customization and design features. And Wix is partnering with other design and image sites to include compelling features for website building. For example, Wix has partnered with stock image site Fotolia to give users access to the site&#8217;s 5 million images. Wix is growing and currently has 3.5 million free users with 400,000 new users joining per month. The site faces competition from Weebly Sprout, Yola, and others.Here&#8217;s an example of a website created using Wix.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It wants you to share more links through Google properties such as Gmail, Google Reader, Google News, and Google Buzz.  Today, it is adding a new sharing feature to Google Bookmarks.  You can now organize bookmarks into lists and share those lists.For instance, I created this list of stories about Google&#8217;s new approach to China (or is it a retreat?).  It is a public list.  People can follow the list, in case I add more links, or copy the list to their own bookmarks.  The list is shareable via email or as a link.  The list&#8217;s creator can move items up and down the list or create new sections.  It is a pretty basic way to group links together, but seems like it could come in handy.To be honest, I almost completely forgot about Google Bookmarks.  In fact, the last time I used it before today was in 2005.  But it is integrated into the Google Toolbar and actually gets a lot of usage.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Now AOL is  launching a charitable offshoot of Patch, called Patch.org, which will support the funding of hyperlocal news sites in &#8220;underserved communities.&#8221; According to a release, &#8220;Patch.org will partner with community foundations and other organizations to launch Patch sites and bring objective local news and information to communities and neighborhoods around the world that lack adequate news media and online local information resources.&#8221;Patch.org will use funding to support and sustain sites that are modeled on Patch&#8217;s model. For each of the sites launched through Patch.org, a professional local journalist will produce original objective news and information about the area and curate user-contributed events, announcements, photos and video. Any profits derived from Patch.org-funded sites will be returned to the communities they serve. The foundation will operate in conjunction with Patchâ\\x80\\x99s Give 5 program, which donates advertising space and employee volunteer time to charitable organizations in local communities.According to a recent 10-K filing, Patch was bought by AOL for $7.0 million in cash. AOL&#8217;s CEO Tim Armstrong, had previously invested $4.5 million in Patch back in his Google days via his private investment firm Polar Capital. We know that Armstrong is not only bullish on niche content but is also looking for AOL to become a content powerhouse.  The company has even developed its own CMS, Seed, which is a content machine that aims to redefine journalism. And AOL just bought internet video company StudioNow, which was integrated into Seed, to boost its video content on editorial sites. AOL also recently set up a $10 million fund to invest in local startups. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Online storefronts for retail goods are popping up all over Facebook, with the social network fast becoming a virtual shopping mall. We recently wrote about Payvment, a startup that implements PayPal&#8217;s Adaptive Payments API to let anyone set up a retail storefront on Facebook. Today, BigCommerce, a company that provides ecommerce software to online retailers and merchants, is adding the ability to create a storefront on Facebook pages.Called SocialShop, the application allows merchants to display products on a Facebook Page. Merchants just have to add the application to their page, enter their store URL and then choose which products they want to display on the page. The retail platform will show up in a &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; tab on the page, and allows visitors to share products with their friends  Facebook users can then click on a product to learn more but in order to buy the product they will be taken away from Facebook to the merchants store (which is also powered by BigCommerce). The one drawback to BigCommerce&#8217;s application is that the actual transaction needs to take place on the merchant&#8217;s BigCommerce website instead of within Facebook. But Mitchell Harper, CEO of BigCommerce, says that this can also draw more traffic to the merchant&#8217;s main storefront. BigCommerce helps small businesses power anything and everything related to an online storefront from search to inventory to online payments to marketing and SEO. And the price for the software is affordable for small businesses, with basic plans starting at $25 per month. The company is currently powering online storefronts for 4000 businesses and faces competition from Yahoo Stores and eBay&#8217;s ProStores.     CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I hate it when a product like the Viliv S10 Blade looks so good as a concept but fails to live up to its potential. The S10 has a late-model Atom CPU, 1GB of RAM, and a multitouch 10-inch screen. Should be solid, right? Wrong.FeaturesMultitouch resistive touchscreenConvertible design32GB or 64GB SSDIntel Atom Z530 or Z550 CPUProsBattery life at around 7 hours with WiFi onMultitouch screen combined with Win7&#8217;s Touch PackGreat 3G modemConsChintzy build qualityVery weak screen hingeNo way to lock the screen in tablet configurationReviewThe Viliv S10 Blade is the largest and latest model in Viliv&#8217;s growing arsenal. It&#8217;s essentially an S7 with a larger screen, with the same convertible touchscreen design and 3G modem. However the S10 adds a 7-point multitouch to the mix along with Windows 7. These two main additions make for a much more pleasing user experience.Computer power-wise, the S10 is technically faster than the S7 with a 1.66GHz Atom rather than a 1.33GHz. But it doesn&#8217;t seem faster because it also uses Windows 7 instead of XP. Even with all of Windows 7&#8217;s fancy user enhancements turn off, there&#8217;s still some noticeable lag opening and closing programs. Things tend toÂ\\xa0stutter. But that&#8217;s a small price to pay for the goodies that come with Windows 7 Touch Pack.While Windows 7 certainly isn&#8217;t a touchscreen-type interface, the Touch Pack makes it at least usable with a slightly modified pointer. The pack builds the touchscreen interface controls directly into the OS, rather than relying on 3rd party solutions that often didn&#8217;t work well.Touch the screen and the pointer turns from an arrow into a small round circle, which is better suited for a finger or the included stylis. Touch and hold brings up the right click menu along with the ability to drag and select multiple icons. Even the Microsoft Surface apps are included with the pack, although the graphically-intense programs do not run well on the low-power S10. Also, the handwriting app could use a little work. (see the pic to to the left)None of this touchscreen fun is Viliv&#8217;s doing, though. It&#8217;s an official Windows 7 add-on pack. Viliv however opted for a nice mutlitouch touchscreen that full takes advantage of this pack. Everything from pinch-to-zoom works. It&#8217;s practical use however is still in question because right now there isn&#8217;t much taking advantage of it on the small, low-power device.While the multitouch screen is cool, it&#8217;s also one of the S10&#8217;s mainÂ\\xa0disappointment. It has a horrible viewing angle. It must be +/-10 degrees. Users cannot be at all off of center. Forget about folding the screen flat and laying the it on the table in slate mode. You can&#8217;t see it unless you&#8217;re directly above the screen.Then there&#8217;s the screen hinge. This is where the S10 really starts to fall apart. It&#8217;s a bit on the loosey goosey side. A loose hinge is even worse on a convertable notebook as there&#8217;s nothing stopping the screen from twisting and turning at the slightest touch.Generally convertable notebooks and netbooks have a little latch or a very strong hinge to prevent the screen from moving when in notebook mode. Then in tablet mode, there should be another latch that locks the screen in place. But the S10 doesn&#8217;t have either allowing the screen to move around way too much. This could be a dealbreaker for some power users coming looking to upgrade from older convertible models.It&#8217;s not just the screen that looks and feels cheap. Even the slightly amount of pressure between the battery and the front lip causes the plastic to flex, revealing the hard edge of the battery. The keyboard is mushy and while the trackpad is fine, the mouse buttons are the single bar-type that rock between right and left click that require you to click on a small sweet spot rather than anywhere on the bar. The speakers are horrible, which is actually a bit of a surprise. The two previous Viliv&#8217;s I&#8217;ve reviewed, the X70 tablet and S7 netbook, both had speakers that were both loud and clear. Not the S10, though.The computing power is on par for an Atom. It handles YouTube and Xvid videos fine, but chokes when it comes to Hulu and any of the included Microsoft Surface apps. GeekBench gave it a 793.There is some good news, though. The 3G modem is great and I found the battery lasted around 7 hours under normal use with the WiFi on. (that&#8217;s it)So while I love to tell you that the S10 is a viable slate alternative, I can&#8217;t. The bad screen hinge is that big of a deal in my mind. It not only contributes to the cheap feel, but also seriously limits the S10&#8217;s ability as a tablet as there&#8217;s no way to confidently keep the netbook in tablet mode without the aid of a latch or locking mechanism. It&#8217;s a fine netbook with the normal mediocre performance that an Atom CPU offers, but don&#8217;t think that the S10 is the best of both the netbook and tablet worlds.',\n",

In a blog post, Google has announced that it is adding a new feature that alerts users when the service detects &#8220;suspicious account activity&#8221;. Namely, Gmail will now give users a warning if it detects that they&#8217;re accessing their accounts from two different geographic regions within a short amount of time (credit cards often do the same thing).The feature takes advantage of the IP tracking that Google launched back in July 2008, which lets users see the last few IP addresses to access their account.  This doesn&#8217;t provide amazing accuracy (in the US it only displays what state you&#8217;re in), but it should at least help users detect attacks from across the country or abroad.Of course, there are plenty of reasons why multiple people might be accessing the same Gmail account, so Gmail doesn&#8217;t lock you out â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it just shows you a warning and prompts you to change your password. Â\\xa0Google&#8217;s post also notes that the service will be coming to Google Apps after it gets feedback from its education and business customers.One other security protection Gmail recently rolled out is default SSL access.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Some hobby: his investments include Twitter, Digg, Chegg, Gowalla, ngmoco, Smule, Kwedit and a dozen or so other well known startups. And he&#8217;s already cashed in on a few of those investments by selling some of his stock in secondary venture rounds.At first he put his own money to work. Then he raised a $10 million fund in 2006, and a second $35 million fund in 2008. And along the way he added a partner, Ann Miura-Ko.Maples now admits that his hobby is more of an obsession, and he&#8217;s changing the name of his fund to mark the milestone. Goodbye, Maples Investments. Hello, FLOODGATE.What&#8217;s changing? Not much, which is precisely the point. Maples has focused on finding disruptive startups that don&#8217;t need a lot of cash to win since the beginning. That sounds smart, but the prevailing wisdom in Silicon Valley is often still the notion that a startup that wants to disrupt a big industry needs big capital. You can listen to his outline his investment approach in a talk he gave earlier this year at a Future Of Funding event in Silicon Valley put on by Adeo Ressi. He calls the startups he&#8217;s looking for &#8220;Thunder Lizards.&#8221; He wants startups that are like Godzilla, he says, who eats his competitors and tears apart cities. It&#8217;s a fascinating video.Part of this whole Thunder Lizard philosophy is to find startups that not only have a great idea, but it&#8217;s a great idea that everyone else thinks is ridiculous. That gives the startup room to grow before competition hits. It doesn&#8217;t matter if a startup idea is wrong, the venture money is lost. But if it&#8217;s right and everyone jumps in at the same time, competition eats profits. He&#8217;s looking for startups that are &#8220;non-consensus right&#8221; and he uses Chegg, which rents textbooks to college students, as a prime example. He invested in 2007. Two years later Kleiner Perkins jumped in.I spoke with Mike and Ann last week about the new launch of FLOODGATE. It&#8217;s a fascinating conversation (see video at top of post). Particularly, in my opinion, when they explain how the name of their new fund (Floodgate, which is a gate to stop floods) is actually about opening the floodgate, not being one. They also talk about the proper care and feeding of young startups (my words, not theirs), and how much value the right early stage investor can bring to a young Godzilla-in-training trying to find its place in the world, and a city to destroy.CrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The developer of video streaming phone-to-phone app Knocking Live Video encountered a little controversy during the launch of an iPhone app a few months ago. The app wasn&#8217;t approved originally because of the use of a private API, but after the developer appealed to Steve Jobs, Knocking Live Video was ushered into the App Store. Now the developer, Pointy Heads Software, is attempting to bring phone-to-phone streaming between the Android and iPhone, with the launch of a platform redesign and an Android app. With the new Android app, Knocking Live Video, which enables users to stream live video to each other over 3G and Wi-Fi networks, promises to broadcast live video between Android and iPhone devices. The iPhone app has also been upgraded with the same functionality. Here&#8217;s how both of the apps work: Once you download the app and set up an account, you can search to find friends who are on the network and then request to start streaming video. Your friend has to approve your friend request in order to begin streaming live video to each other. Both of the apps now allows users to create profiles to allow users to connect with each other to share video. You can also share questions, answers and experiences with other users on Knocking Live Video forums. On the backend, Knocking has improved its server capacity to allow for faster load times and peer-to-peer connections. Since the iPhone app&#8217;s launch in the App Store last December, it is being downloaded approximately 13,000 times daily. Pointy Heads Software also has a nifty photo sharing app, called Knocking, which is applies its  video functionality to photos. The app allows you to instantaneously share up to 100 photos at once between two iPhones.     CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Add one more piece of evidence to all of thoseÂ\\xa0rumors about an impending launch of a Facebook virtual currency at the upcomingÂ\\xa0f8 conference in late April. Â\\xa0Facebook recently applied for a trademark for its virtual currency platform, which is aptly named Facebook Credits.Included in the application is a drawing of the new Facebook payment platform logo (embedded above, although it could still change). Â\\xa0It is a gold coin with a stylized globe in the middle and two arrows flying out of the globe perhaps symbolizing the free flow of virtual cash. Â\\xa0A blue square with a small &#8220;f&#8221; is placed over the bottom right part of the coin.The other noteworthy things about the trademark application are the description given to the payment system and the fact that the assigned USPTO trademark officer thinks it needs some adjustment before the mark can be granted to the company (more info on that).Let&#8217;s start with the description:Financial exchange services, namely, providing a virtual currency for use by members of an online community via computer and communication networks; facilitating the exchange and sale of services and products of third parties via computer and communication networks; incentive award programs; telecommunications services, namely electronic transmission of data, messages and information; entertainment services, namely facilitating interactive and multiplayer and single player game services for games played via computer or communication networks.This description of the service, perhaps unsurprisingly, leaves the door open for Facebook Credits to become much more than merely a virtual currency that can be used for purchasing or exchanging virtual goods on the social network, in the sense that it also encompasses &#8220;facilitating the exchange and sale of services and products of third parties via computer and communication networks.&#8221; Â\\xa0In other words, Â\\xa0any InternetÂ\\xa0commerce, linking Facebook to the consumption of a wide variety of consumer-oriented products and services. Obviously, Facebook Connect could play an important role in that story as a way to authenticate users on third-party ecommerce sites.See for example the apparent partnership Facebook and Eventbrite are putting in place for the monetization of events.On-topic: Facebook recently announced a partnership with PayPal, broadening the number of options people have to purchase Facebook Credits using the latter&#8217;s online payments system (PayPal has some 81 million users worldwide, while Facebook recently claimed over 400 million). According to Facebook, its platform now boasts more than 500,000 applications. Notably, the company also recently announced that it may soon start allowing developers to store end user data for more than 24 hours.Facebook is on track to pull in somewhere in between $1.1 and $2 billion in revenues in 2010 according to industry observers, and a roll-out of Facebook Credits might just make it end up at the high end of that estimate as it opens up a number of potentially very lucrative revenue streams for the company. Facebook recently announced that it would be taking a 30% cut on currency spent by users, leaving 70% for developers.Facebook Credits kicked off in alpha mode in May 2009 and has been in closed beta for a good number of months, granting a select few developers like Zynga, Playdom, Playfish and RockYou access to the program in anticipation of a more extensive roll-out.I daresay we&#8217;ll hear more about the company&#8217;s quest to put its stake in the ground and attempt to become the Web&#8217;s default virtual currency at f8.(Image via InsideFacebook)CrunchBase Information',\n",

The Chinese search engine company&#8217;s shares are soaring, surpassing the $600 price mark this morning for the first time since it started trading on the U.S. public markets in August 2005.Google, in case you haven&#8217;t heard, shut down its Chinese search engine two days ago in response to the widely reported cyber attack on Google in December 2009.Baidu&#8217;s stock price jumped yesterday too, after investment firm Kaufman Brothers upgraded shares from hold to buy and raised its price target to $690 on expectations for the Chinese company to pick up the market share in their home country that Google will probably lose.When you look at Baidu&#8217;s stock performance over the last 3 months, the jump is even more notable: its lowest price point this year was $386.5 (on 12 January 2010) while recent trading puts the value at no less than $606 per share. That&#8217;s more than triple the stock registered a year ago, and it puts Baidu&#8217;s current market capitalization at about $21.1 billion. For the sake of comparison: that&#8217;s close to Yahoo&#8217;s market cap ($22.5 billion) but a far cry from Google&#8217;s ($172 billion).Earlier this year, Baidu reported blow-out financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009: the company&#8217;s Q4 profit rose 48.2% to 427.9 million yuan (approx. $62.7 million), or $1.80 a share.The recent surge in shares can not be 100% attributed to Google&#8217;s withdrawal from China, however: Baidu already had double its market share in China even before Mountain View publicly disclosed its plans to possibly shutter its Chinese operations, and Baidu is now operating the third largest search engine in the world. Baidu also recently co-invested $50 million in a giant online shopping mall, and raised another $50 million for its new online video endeavor in China, so it&#8217;s poised for growth in other areas than search.Still, Baidu is clearly benefiting as Google backs away from China.CrunchBase Information',\n",

That brings the total invested in the company to more than $13 million, according to the press release. In addition, Avatar Reality has announced that it has recruited Trent Ward to join as the new VP of Design. Ward has been in the industry for quite a while, having worked as creative director for companies like Foundation9, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.Blue Mars is a 3D massively multiplayer works where people can come to create virtual hangouts, games, applications, simulations, shops, businesses and entertainment venues. It launched in open beta in October 2009 and began selling virtual land to third-party developers in January this year. You can find more info about pricing here.Avatar Reality co-founder Henk Rogers is quoted as saying that Blue Mars is &#8220;the inevitable next step in immersive 3D virtual worlds&#8221;, which makes me immensely curious if only for the history of the man. I&#8217;ll let you read his Wikipedia profile for more information, but basically Rogers was singlehandedly responsible for bringing Tetris to the Western hemisphere in the early nineties.Avatar Reality, founded in 2006, is led by CEO Jim Sink, who previously managed business development and partner acquisition at Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live division.

       "  'comments_content': 'The simple bookmarking application Instapaper made by Tumblr developer Marco Arment is one of my favorite applications, period. Between the web, the iPhone, and the Kindle, it&#8217;s easily one of my most-used apps. And I have no doubt that a fourth category is about to be added to that list: the iPad.Tonight, Arment posted a preview of Instapaper for the iPad, and it sounds perfect for the device. Aesthetically, it doesn&#8217;t appear to look all that different from Instapaper for the iPhone. But as Arment explains, he went through quite a bit of trouble to tailor it for the new device. One entirely new feature is a list screen that allows you to easily navigate bookmarked articles when the iPad is held horizontally.So why not just let users scale up the current iPhone version of the app? Because it looks awful, according to Arment. In fact, he says that the experience of seeing his app scaled this way (2x) has turned him off of the idea of using any app scaled up to the iPad&#8217;s resolution. Arment is basing this off of his experience with the iPad software simulator (since no developers have the actual device yet), but I can confirm that some apps did look a bit wonky when scaled up when I played with the device after Apple&#8217;s unveiling in January.To be iPad-ready, Arment reworked the latest version of Instapaper (2.2) and now has made a &#8220;universal&#8221; version of the app. While clearly the iPhone and iPad versions will be different, apparently developers will be able to bundle iPhone/iPod touch versions with iPad versions in one package (the SDK page hints at this). This is interesting as it allows developers to charge one fee for the two different versions. I wonder if more developers will offer similar deals. If Arment was so unhappy with the iPad scaling, clearly others will be as well, and will also be anxious to have an iPad-native version of their app. But telling paying customers they have to pay twice is a bit of a stretch, so this universal approach seems smart. And it conjures up memories of the universal apps that existed as Apple transitioned from its old PowerPC chips to the newer Intel ones.With iBooks and all the print media deals, clearly Apple believes one of the iPad&#8217;s core strengths will be reading. That&#8217;s why I think Instapaper may be one of the first real killer apps for the device. Instapaper takes any piece of content on the web and strips it down to its bare reading essentials. It&#8217;s a breeze to find a piece of longer content on the web, hit the Instapaper bookmarklet, and revist the content in its stripped-down form later on the iPhone or Kindle. And on the iPad, with this reworked app, the experience looks to be even better.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google&#8217;s Matt Cutts takes issue with my post yesterday expressing mild outrage that Facebook puts its application developers in a position of having to choose between &#8220;user experience&#8221; and &#8220;monetization.&#8221; I called that choice the &#8220;Evil Dial&#8221; &#8211; more evil, more money, and Facebook gets their cut because all of these guys plow that money back into Facebook advertising.Cutts&#8217; issue is the apparent contradiction with an earlier post where I criticize Twitter for saying that they want to â\\x80\\x9cbe a force for good.â\\x80\\x9d &#8220;Let others use Twitter to do good things. Twitter should stay goodness-neutral and self righteous free,&#8221; I say in that post.The reason these two posts don&#8217;t contradict each other is the last sentence of my Twitter post, where I say this: &#8220;Or alternatively try to be a force for good. But just do it, donâ\\x80\\x99t talk about it.&#8221;But it&#8217;s a lot harder to actually be good than it is to simply say you are good.Like others, I am becoming increasingly skeptical of the original Don&#8217;t Be Evil company (the one Cutts works for, in fact). Their hypocrisy on China is stunning. It&#8217;s hard to argue with the evidence Danny Sullivan laid out. Whether Google is doing business with the Chinese government in 2006 or pulling out of the market in 2010 they make the same argument that good v. evil dictates their actions. Bullshit.I&#8217;ve thought long and hard about my position on this since the news about Google in China first broke in January. I didn&#8217;t want to spout off half cocked with an opinion that I&#8217;d later regret. And after long deliberation, I&#8217;ve come to that simple conclusion. Google&#8217;s position is bullshit.That&#8217;s why I wince when I see Twitter following that same path. Because Googlers really think that they are doing the right thing. It&#8217;s a self righteous groupthink that leads to situations like this. And on a mass scale it can be dangerous as hell. A lot of that same self righteousness pervades the ranks at Twitter today. It led them to, for example, remove news sites like this one from the suggested user list in 2009 when we didn&#8217;t fall into line editorially. As Twitter&#8217;s power grows, how will Twitter define good v. evil? Perhaps revolutionary actions in Iran are ok and supported, but in another country they aren&#8217;t? Will Twitter continue to pick and choose which politicians get on the suggested user list, or whatever future mechanism they have for helping out &#8220;good&#8221; politicians v. &#8220;evil&#8221; ones?Of course they will. Because they aren&#8217;t striving for neutrality, they&#8217;re striving to support their version of good. So back to Facebook. What I&#8217;m arguing for here is a straight up ban of misleading advertising that dupes consumers into buying stuff they don&#8217;t want to buy. They don&#8217;t have to create a frickin slogan, all they have to do is protect their users from bad people that want to steal their money. But at least we know where things stand with Facebook. There&#8217;s a straight up Evil Dial. I&#8217;ll take that over religious zealotry any day.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When Lissn launched at TechCrunch50 this past year, it had what seemed to be a hot basic premise: Twitter meets Google Wave. Unfortunately, as time has proven, Google Wave has yet to catch on in a meaningful way, as it&#8217;s too noisy for most people. And in many ways, the first version of Lissn seemed a bit too noisy. With the latest version launching today, the team has simplified things a lot.Whereas the first version was based around specific conversations, Lissn 2.0 is entirely based around individuals. It doesn&#8217;t matter what they&#8217;re talking about, only who they are, and that you might be interested in having a conversation with them, or listening in on the one they&#8217;re having. In fact, the only pages that exist on the site now beyond the list of all users online and the list of your favorite users (&#8220;memory,&#8221; as it&#8217;s called), are individual user pages. From there, you have only three options: listen in (by watching), &#8220;say something,&#8221; or &#8220;ask a question.&#8221;Doing either of the latter two will place your text in a stream above the user&#8217;s avatar. From there, depending on how many people are in the room, it&#8217;s basically a massive IM conversation. Or, if you feel like starting your own conversation, you simply go to your page and say something in the text box along the bottom of the page.To me, there&#8217;s something compelling about Lissn because it&#8217;s now very, very simple â\\x80\\x94 sort of like Twitter, back in its early stages. You really can only do a few things, again, like Twitter. However, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if Lissn is now too simple. Having conversations is nice, but what&#8217;s the benefit to having them on Lissn versus over IM with multiple people? Maybe something like great search functionality would entice me, but there is no search right now. But the team says it plans to iterate with this new version on a weekly basis, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if that&#8217;s coming.Whereas rival LiveFyre is based around specific topics to have conversations about, Lissn offers no context for conversations, so it will likely be hard to jump into one. That said, if the service positions it sort of like a Formspring.me-type Q&amp;A with a certain user, it could be kind of interesting.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

Tomorrow, the service is officially rolling out its second revenue generator: premium themes.The initial 13 themes being featured in this roll-out look pretty great. They come from 7 different designers and will range in price from $9 all the way up to $49. Tumblr declined to give the revenue split between the company and the designers but says that &#8220;most&#8221; of the money will go to the designers. The premium themes page is actually already live here.This seems like a smart play for Tumblr. One thing that separates it from rivals such as Posterous is the attention to design. Tumblr already features over 350 free templates that any user can install with the click of a button. &#8220;There&#8217;s already been a ton of demandÂ\\xa0for this platform [premium designs] from our developer community, and we know it will add a spectacular collection of new themes and options for our bloggers,&#8221; says founder David Karp.The roll out of this second premium feature is the latest in a huge amount of updates the service has unveiled in the past several weeks.

Users have now answered 50 millions questions on the service, which uses your answers to help give you recommendations for just about anything. Investors have taken note of their progress, and they recently closed a $12 million venture round from Khosla Ventures and previous investors.I sat down with cofounder Caterina Fake last week to talk about Hunch and how it can help people make decisions about things. As people use the service over time Hunch is able to build out a very deep taste graph of what they like and dislike. It&#8217;s a sort of DNA of people&#8217;s taste preferences and a parallel to the social graph that they are building out on Facebook and elsewhere. The lights are too bright and the sound echoes (we&#8217;re still working on our new studio), but Caterina gives deep insight into what Hunch is all about. And we also talk about Yahoo. Caterina was an executive at Yahoo from 2005 &#8211; 2008 after her previous startup, Flickr, was acquired.  Yahoo has an uphill battle, she says, and we spoke about their need for a product visionary:The full transcript is below:Mr. MICHAEL ARRINGTON: I&#8217;m here with Caterina Fake, the co-founder of Hunch. Hello.Ms. CATERINA FAKE (Co-Founder, Hunch): Hello.Mr. ARRINGTON: Thanks for coming in.Ms. FAKE: Thank you.Mr. ARRINGTON: You guys just raised a big round of financing a week ago from Khosla Ventures.Ms. FAKE: Twelve million dollars.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah and we covered that, but I thought it was probably time to maybe talk to you a little bit more about Hunch and do a deeper dive than we have in the past with the company.Ms. FAKE: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: So, OK, first thing is, what is Hunch and why does it matter?Ms. FAKE: So, the way Hunch works is Hunch learns about you. Hunch asks a bunch of questions which we call Teach Hunch about You. Those are questions about demographics, beliefs and values, your aesthetics, your political views, all those kinds of things and it&#8217;s meant to be fun. There&#8217;s a kind of a little module up in the corner of the front page if you go in and, you know, it&#8217;s everything from, do you live in the country or the city or the suburbs. Do you cut your sandwich down the middle or diagonal? You have you ever used a fake ID when you were underage? That kind of thingâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: And that tells you Hunchâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: And it tells you all of these â\\x80\\x93 all of these like really interesting things and it enablesâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: If I cut my sandwich down the middle or diagonally, let&#8217;s say kind of diagonally, what does that tell you?Ms. FAKE: Yeah, there is this tremendous database that we have of all of these into like fascinating correlations and it turns out there&#8217;s certain things that are like the example that I just gave; if you have used a fake ID when you were an underage youâ\\x80\\x99re significantly more likely to be an entrepreneur. It means that, you&#8217;re like kind of like moreâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Does everyone use a fake ID? I use plenty(ph). Could you useâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Well, like the Silicon Valley Entrepreneurs? And I usedâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: You used one?Ms. FAKE: I used a fake ID when I was underage.Mr. ARRINGTON: Is there a (unintelligible) in Canada?Ms. FAKE: There &#8211; I&#8217;m not Canadian. I&#8217;m actually American.Mr. ARRINGTON: Oh you just lived in Vancouver when you guys started?Ms. FAKE: Yeah. Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: OKMs. FAKE: Yeah. So, you can learn all these really interesting things and, Hunch really is a way for us to give you the best recommendations possible. It&#8217;s a bit like Amazon or Netflix recommendations for everything andâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: What is â\\x80\\x93 thatâ\\x80\\x99s for? Movies? Restaurants? Vacations?Ms. FAKE: It &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t actually â\\x80\\x93 no, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t actually limit it to anything in particular. I mean, it should work for everything. It should work for, I need a hotel in Dallas. I need to find a philosopher. I need the New York Time&#8217;s bestseller to bring on vacation with me, we know everything. It should work for those things that especially are very taste-oriented and I think that the thing that really distinguishes Hunch from other efforts out there, there&#8217;s a lot of kind of products that are, attacking a kind of like a similar problem is that we are trying to create this taste graph for the whole web. We&#8217;re trying to learn the tastes of all of the people out there andâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: That&#8217;s obviously a planned social graph, right?Ms. FAKE: Which is a planned social graph, right? It&#8217;s analogous like the taste graph we&#8217;re saying is something that&#8217;s analogous to like the social graph. But from our perspective, the social graph is actually less informative and actually gives you less valuable information on you than what we&#8217;re calling the taste graph because you may &#8211; I may be in contact with my co-workers, who are kind of like male engineer types and, with my mom, I have a very close relationship with. But our tastes are very different, the things that we like, the sushi restaurants or (unintelligible) that we&#8217;d be interested inâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Or the clothes that we would wear and so, what we&#8217;re &#8211; our assumption is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s people out there who share similar taste. They have a similar aesthetic to you or they have, say, you&#8217;re kind of looking for a blog or a news show, your political position or political stance would inform that choice as well. So, that&#8217;s really whatâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: And this actually works?Ms. FAKE: And this actually works, yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: You found statistically relevant resultsâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yes. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a completely data-driven kind of like algorithmic side and so the way that Hunch evolved was we launched last &#8211; June of last year and I&#8217;d say that this first â\\x80\\x93 the first part of this phase of the product&#8217;s development, we had a kind of a chicken and egg problem in order to make really good recommendations, in order to understand the taste graph. We had to gather all of these data. We had to have information. We had to get kind of a cold start problem. And so we&#8217;ve spent the past â\\x80\\x93 how long has it been â\\x80\\x93 seven or eight months now gathering information about people, learning about people and we have 1.5 million uniques(ph)â\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yup. Ms. FAKE: In the past couple of months, each month andâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: So, 1.5 million people a month are coming to the siteâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Are coming to the site andâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: And answering these questionsâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: What we have &#8211; I mean, we do have 200,000 &#8211; I would say the best data that we gather from the 200,000 registered users who were â\\x80\\x93 have been answering an average of 140 of these questions. So, we have over 50 million questions answered in our site. Mr. ARRINGTON: Wellâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: So, it&#8217;s an incredible amount of data. And now, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re in the position where we can actually use this data. We can actually make assumptions. We can make â\\x80\\x93 we can draw connections between people and products and services and all of those kinds of things.Mr. ARRINGTON: How do you â\\x80\\x93 well, actually, let&#8217;s take one step back and then talk like the company was different before you started because you&#8217;re a co-founder, and you actually joined little later and whatâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah. Mr. ARRINGTON: How â\\x80\\x93 what &#8211; did youâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right.Mr. ARRINGTON: Move the direction and what was it before and why did it change?Ms. FAKE: So what happened with â\\x80\\x93 what happened with Hunch is it was â\\x80\\x93 it was originally founded by Chris Dixon and Tom Pinckney and Matt Gattis. And they had come out of &#8211; their prior company was SiteAdvisor which they built in, I believe, 2005, 2006. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: And they were &#8211; they sold it to McAfee for $74 million. What they were doing was like kind of like security â\\x80\\x93 a security site which analyzed, you can kind of guess by the name, it&#8217;s like SiteAdvisor tells you the kind of the relative safety of visiting various sites. And so their initial product, the thing that they were developing originally was it was a decision tree model. It was kind of based on expert systems where a series of questions were asked and you got an answer at the end. And so they started off â\\x80\\x93 they kind of hoping to fund experiments that they try that did not succeed including, sort of like a thing called pure printer fixer(ph) or you had to go down this decision tree, like is it plugged in, itâ\\x80\\x99s the toner in the cartridge. You know, they basically kind of take you down this path and observe a diagnostic tool. But they knew that there is something very interesting about destruction in this model learning things. And then there is this â\\x80\\x93 there&#8217;s this other part of it where they, ask questions, some of which were amusing, some of which were kind of very serious. Those were the taste-orientedâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Questions that I would say. And at some point, they had done â\\x80\\x93 they have been doing this in an entirely automatic way. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: They have kind of like â\\x80\\x93 for example they had sucked in the entire, products database of Amazon, for example. And it felt computational, it felt mechanical. It felt as if a computer had done it. And at some point they realized that the only way that this was going to work, that the only way the Hunch was going to work, was as if it were a user-generated content site and that there had to be human input. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: There had to be people contributing to it. And that was coincidentally the week that they figured that out. I was introduced to them by their venture partner, one of their investors is Bessemer. And so I kind of walked in just at the moment and they realized that this had to be man plus machine. It had to be human-added content as well as sort of very, (unintelligible) kind of computational algorithmic stuff on the back end. And so that of course, is my background and that&#8217;s kind of one of the strengths of my, part of development soâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: All right. So looking forward, how do you know it&#8217;s working? Like what&#8217;s the feedback from the users that tells you&#8230;Ms. FAKE: Yeah. I mean, we doâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Weâ\\x80\\x99re helping them.Ms. FAKE: We we measure kind of internally as our success rate. So we give a recommendation and the user will say do you like this, yes or no. Well, no if they click through a to read more about it, if they&#8217;ll, go actually and go purchase the product. Those were â\\x80\\x93 those are the strongest signals that we have. And, we were starting on â\\x80\\x93 this is our so-called success rate has been increasing over time. When we launched it was, in the 70&#8217;s. You know, like 72 or 73 percent success rate.Mr. ARRINGTON: And thatâ\\x80\\x99s based on the user does something with the recommendation.Ms. FAKE: Yes, yes, like in a positive direction I guess. That means a positive kind of â\\x80\\x93 in a way that&#8217;s increased of, you know, until like the 90&#8217;s now. And so we have a good 90 percent success rate. And so that&#8217;s how we measure our success soâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: It&#8217;s interesting that you allow people â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s so &#8211; your recommendations are based on the data that you getâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: From people on building the â\\x80\\x93 well, you&#8217;re calling the taste graph.Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: But you allow anonymous users to go in and use the site without being logged in.Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: And do you just give them that pretty good answers and whyâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah. I mean, there&#8217;s a significant increase in our success rate obviously when people who log in when they answer questions when we get to know them over time. And I do think that, if we were to re-launch today one of the things we would very strongly consider is that it only be a logged in experience. I mean, I do think that when we launched it&#8217;s one of those things that you learn, and we&#8217;re â\\x80\\x93 it&#8217;s a very new product we are inventing in as it kind of goes along and, this got &#8211; this to me, personally is of â\\x80\\x93 is, kind of the most gratifying product to build as the one where you&#8217;re not really sure or like how to build and it&#8217;s not really clear how itâ\\x80\\x99s going to turn out. You do a lot of experimentation. And I do think that one of the things that we would have considered from the outside is making it just logged in. I mean, I do think that, it very clearly improves to an incredible degree with our experienceâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: So why not change it now or just&#8230;Ms. FAKE: Yeah, yeah. That&#8217;s one of the things thatâ\\x80\\x99s sort of under consideration. Mr. ARRINGTON: OK.Ms. FAKE: Well, we do have an amazing increase in the number of users that were coming in through SEO. And so it&#8217;s a trade-off. Because you are able to give people pretty good answers, pretty good recommendations without them having answered 140 questions as the average walked-in user has. But it&#8217;s not nearly as good.Mr. ARRINGTON: Something I wanted to ask you. You were the co-founder of Flickrâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah. Mr. ARRINGTON: And &#8211; and we know how that turned out. And so many people love Flickr and you&#8217;re a bit of a celebrity founder now. You definitely entered that.Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Is it easier to grow a startup as a celebrity founder or harderâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: You know, that&#8217;s an interesting questionâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Or is it â\\x80\\x93 the more tension there&#8217;s more expectations orâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: There&#8217;s more &#8211; there&#8217;s a lot of â\\x80\\x93 I do â\\x80\\x93 I do think that&#8217;s the case. There&#8217;s definitely more tension which isâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Which can be good and bad.  I do think that a lot â\\x80\\x93 one of the things that you have to be on guard against is not taking risks because I think that you can, if youâ\\x80\\x99veâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: If youâ\\x80\\x99ve had a big success previously, you can stop taking risks. You can&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: In fact, psychologically, you&#8217;re&#8230;Ms. FAKE: You&#8217;re kind of guard it against â\\x80\\x93 you want to kind of â\\x80\\x93 you keep what you&#8217;ve got, right?Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: You want it, and so it makes you less willing to take risks.Mr. ARRINGTON: So how you do fight that?Ms. FAKE: I mean, you just have to very deliberately do that. And I think in a lot of ways, you have to really kind of like focus in and kind of filter out the noise and all of the kind of attention that you could potentially get drunk on. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Like people you know, if you kind of â\\x80\\x93 it happens to â\\x80\\x93 it happens to a lot of successful companies, Not just individuals or founders but companies themselves if you start believing in press releases. It&#8217;s a very dangerous situation that you want to get out of. And to me, I think it would&#8217;ve been â\\x80\\x93 I&#8217;ve seen many â\\x80\\x93 many second time, third time entrepreneur founders going down the same route that they had gone down before without a lot of variation. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: And that was something that I&#8217;m very much wanted to avoid and Hunch is obviously vastly different from Flickr. And I think part of that was informed by the time that I spent at Yahoo. When I was at Yahoo, the most interesting thing that was going on there was social search. At that time since I was there, 2005 through 2008, the most&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: And you werenâ\\x80\\x99t running Flickr. I mean, that was handed off, right? I mean, you were&#8230;Ms. FAKE: Yes. What happened was that was when we came in, we came in &#8211; we made sure that Flickr which has a very good outcome, that Flickr stayed Flickr. We wanted to make sure that it did. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: It&#8217;s very common for a company to be acquired and to lose its heart and soul and to kind of get &#8211; get lost. And so, you know, we spent a lot of time protecting it, making sure thatâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: You know, the heart of Flickr remained. And then once that, once I felt as if Flickr was on the right path, then I branched out. And the most interesting thing going on, as I was staying, was social search and, at that time, and this is no longer the case, unfortunately, but Yahoo is going up against Google in search. And so as a result &#8211; and they knew what their strong suits were. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Yahoo knew that a strong suit was a social. They had logged in users. They knew a lot about their users. Their users were people that came back. They, used a lot of different products an average of like two and a half products, like whatever Yahoo Finance or, mail or IM or what-have-you. And you know, and as a result there is an incredible amount â\\x80\\x93 amount of social information that could be used in search. And so that was a lot of the work that I was doing while I was there, I was working in social search. And then subsequent to that, I worked on the problem of actually developing product at Yahoo as wellâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Because they know where the problem was. You know, obviously coming from the startup going into a large organization like Yahoo is that often the obstacles thereâ\\x80\\x99s no innovation deficit in a company like Yahoo. There is an incredible amount of invention and creation, but often what happens is the organization gets in the way. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: And so then, subsequent to kind of working in social search I worked on &#8211; I worked on, how do you get products built.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Within a big company like that so&#8230; Mr. ARRINGTON: Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to talk to you a lot more about that, but since you brought up Yahoo I will go a little deeper into it. I thought Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting into too much of a sensitive areaâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: But when Yahoo changed CEO&#8217;s at the end of â\\x80\\x9908â\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Right.Mr. ARRINGTON: And they hired Bartz, Carol Bartz. A lot us were rooting for Yahoo to hire somebody who was product-focused, true product visionary. Microsoft had Bill Gates, Apple has Steve Jobs.Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: There are other examples as well although not many.Ms. FAKE: Yeah. But I agree with it, by the way, yes. Mr. ARRINGTON: You agree that maybeâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yes. The product youâ\\x80\\x99re in.Mr. ARRINGTON: Somebody &#8211; and they didnâ\\x80\\x99t. And they hired somebody who accomplished &#8211; accomplished executiveâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: But did &#8211; and then they subsequently have not hired a true product visionary that I can see evenâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Even under Carol. Do you agree with like â\\x80\\x93 you sound like youâ\\x80\\x99re very pleased&#8230;Ms. FAKE: I agree, absolutely. And I do think that one of the things that they should have done exactly is bring in a product person. To some extentâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Weren&#8217;t some of those people already in the company?Ms. FAKE: Interestingly, yes. I mean, some of those people were already in the company and interestingly, I actually&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: But theyâ\\x80\\x99ve all left now, right?Ms. FAKE: I actually think that Jerry Yang &#8211; Jerry Yang was one of the best product people. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: And I &#8211; during the time that I was at Yahoo, all of the best product decisions I think, that were made during the eraâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: During the period when I was there were made by Jerry Yang and all of the things that he funded &#8211; he funded the Yahoo Developer Network and it was a great example. He funded Yahoo Answers. I mean, all of the successful products that immersed out of there and all of the great&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: What do you mean by funded? That he green lighted it?Ms. FAKE: He had to green light it. He has a discretion pedestal, thus a discretionary project where he can green light any project from the companyâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: OK.Ms. FAKE: As a founder, you know, chief guy. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: And everything that he green lighted and funded were, very successful. So, in some ways it is interesting because during the brief, you interregnum, you know between Terry Semel and Carol Bartz, he was the CEO.  But unfortunately during that time it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t &#8211; the focus was not on building our products it was on fending off Steve Ballmer in Microsoft soâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Well, why can&#8217;t he be that person today? Is it &#8211; he&#8217;s damaged now? He&#8217;s&#8230;Ms. FAKE: I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know. I mean, I don&#8217;t have enough view. I guess, good enough view into the workings of the company now under Carol Bartz right now. Mr. ARRINGTON: Do you think Yahoo can â\\x80\\x93 can, not will, but can re-emerge asâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Re-emerge? Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be a long uphill battle.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yup.Ms. FAKE: I mean, itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s sad to me because I think that Yahoo is in a not a very strong position as it was even when I started there in 2005. And I think the industry&#8217;s wish(ph) for it because I think a strong Yahoo is really good for the industry as a whole.Mr. ARRINGTON: Some of your â\\x80\\x93 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll call them competitors, theyâ\\x80\\x99re not really product competitors but guys like Aardvark and others been taken out and then acquired. Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Have you guys had some acquisition pressure that youâ\\x80\\x99ve&#8230;Ms. FAKE: There has been &#8211; I mean, there have been kind of, you know, nibblesâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: You know, kind of around the edges but we are not really interested in, you know, doing in acquisitions.Mr. ARRINGTON: You don&#8217;t want a $50 million exit?  Ms. FAKE: No. Mr. ARRINGTON: You want what?Ms. FAKE: Yeah. I mean, I guess &#8211; you know, I &#8211; both my co-foundersâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Right.Ms. FAKE: They sold SiteAdvisor to McAfee. I sold Flickr to Yahoo. You know, none of us are really interested in, you know, a kind of an acquisition. You know, we really want to have a company that we built and, you know, and swing for the fences and go ambitious. And I think that Hunch we picked a very good problem. I think that we picked a very ambitious area. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: And so I think that it the possibilities are tremendous for the company.Mr. ARRINGTON: Do you think &#8211; I am speculating here but if &#8211; let&#8217;s say I am a regular Hunch user and &#8211; I mean, I use it twice a month, three or four times a month.Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: What does this got? The 200,000 hardcore users, are they using a â\\x80\\x93 you said theyâ\\x80\\x99ve answered 150 questions each.  Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: They are using it pretty regularly.Ms. FAKE: Yeah, very regularly.Mr. ARRINGTON: Once or twice a month it sounds like â\\x80\\x93 yeah, OK.Ms. FAKE: Very regularly, yeah, yeah, and more in.Mr. ARRINGTON: After a year or so of using it you have my taste graph. Ms. FAKE: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: You almost have my taste DNA.Ms. FAKE: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Like you can almost describe me psychologicallyâ\\x80¦Ms. FAKE: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Demographically as a &#8211; you know, as a human being, right?Ms. FAKE: Right. Yeah. And the other thing too is that&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Does that â\\x80\\x93 thatâ\\x80\\x99s still scary. Ms. FAKE: What &#8211; you know, one of the things that we are interested in is actually allowing you to take your taste profile elsewhere. So, you should be able to, for example, we are going to roll out some stuff where it will help you &#8211; it will help you pick out, you know, who to follow on Twitter. It will help you â\\x80\\x93 youâ\\x80\\x99veâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Choose the movies that I want. Ms. FAKE: Choose movies that you want to see. It will be able to &#8211; you know, imagine â\\x80\\x93 imagine, you know, you could take your taste profile and you could apply it to eBay or Etsy. And you could take &#8211; you could take itâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Kind of like anywhere with you.Mr. ARRINGTON: I imagine advertisers will be eager to get their hands on the idea as well.

I mean, Blippy is a really interesting company and I think that in many ways they are doing something very similar to what Hunch is doing and that they are creating a taste profile. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: They are approaching it from a completely differentâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: Direction and that theyâ\\x80\\x99re using your purchase history as a way of &#8211; you know, of basically creating a kind of taste profile.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE:  But I do think that this is going to be a kind of a trend. That the social graph, which everybody is very excited about right now will be in some ways replaced by the taste graph. And what Blippy is doing would be as also kind of creating a taste graph as well but from a different source.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Ms. FAKE: In your purchase history.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. So, no quick sale for you guys, thatâ\\x80\\x99s a promise. Ms. FAKE: No quick sale. Mr. ARRINGTON: Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to see how this plays out.Ms. FAKE: No quick sale, yeah. That doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem like itâ\\x80\\x99s in the cards. Mr. ARRINGTON: Congratulations on the round. Thanks for taking the time with me.Ms. FAKE: Yeah, of course. All right.

       "  'comments_content': 'A couple of years ago, it seems all anyone wanted was access to Qik, the mobile live-stream video service. At the time, Nokia&#8217;s N95 was one of the hot devices you needed to run it. Since then, while the service has been growing, it has lost some of its luster â\\x80\\x94 perhaps because it couldn&#8217;t run on one of the hottest mobile devices out there, the iPhone, until very recently. But now it may be time for Qik to go back on the offensive.Today, all anyone seems to be talking about is the new HTC EVO 4G, Sprint&#8217;s WiMax phone that runs Android which was just unveiled at CTIA. Not only will Qik work on the device, it will come built-in to each one.This is potentially huge news for the service. With even the coolest services, it can be hard to convince users to download your app. But coming pre-installed is worth its weight in gold. And live video streaming seems like the perfect way to test out Sprint&#8217;s new 4G network, which is already deployed in a few cities, and will be in many more this year.And it&#8217;s not just the network. This new device features an 8 megapixel autofocus camera capable of recording HD video. And yes, Qik is able to capture videos in HD with this device. And it even has a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera â\\x80\\x94 something which plenty of vain Qik users will appreciate.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Things on the Web used to be simple for bloggers and publishers.  You published on a Website, and then syndicated it out to other channels via an RSS feed.  But then realtime streams started taking over and RSS couldn&#8217;t keep up, even though technologies like PuSH are speeding it up.  So publishers take their RSS feeds and publish the headlines and a link directly to Twitter with a service like Twitterfeed.  But what about Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and all the other social streams coming down the pike?There are so many ways to syndicate your feeds that it is becoming unmanageable.  A new service called Dlvr.it is launching in open beta today to help publishers deliver their feeds anywhere they want.  Dlvr.it is a new product from in-stream advertising startup Pheedo.  Once you sign up, you select a feed as an input, and then you select where you want to deliver that feed as an output.  Depending on the destination, the feed will appear differently (a headline with a short dlvr.it link for Twitter, a longer excerpt for Facebook).  You can set it to deliver all headlines to Twitter, but only a certain subset to Tumblr.The workflow is a little bit like Yahoo Pipes.  You fill in the blanks, and can set the number of updates per channel, or can even trickle out stories throughout the day if they get published all at once.  Or it can all be pushed out in realtime using the PuSH protocol.  Dlvr.it has its own short URL and also supports bit.ly.  It can add auto-hashtags to your Twitter feed based on pre-existing category tags.  Once you start syndicating through dlvr.it, you can monitor clicks, posts, retweets and other stats in a dashboard.  Twitterfeed also offers analytics, but only for Twitter.  Dlvr.it wants to keep adding services and open up an API to support more inputs than just RSS feeds.  On the other hand, Twitterfeed is much simpler and already has a lot of momentum.  Dlvr.it is a free service.  Check it out and tell us what you think in comments.CrunchBase Information',\n",

They&#8217;re the overlays that come up when you hover over a Twitter username on Twitter.com. They&#8217;ve also exposed a rather interesting bug.With Twitter&#8217;s Retweet functionality, when someone retweets a tweet, below that tweet is placed some text noting who retweeted that item (sorry, I know I just used &#8220;tweet&#8221; or &#8220;retweet&#8221; a dozen times there). That person&#8217;s name is a hyperlink to their Twitter account, so the hovercard function works for that name as well. But if you happen to be the person that retweeted the tweet, it says that &#8220;you&#8221; retweeted the item. And that &#8220;you&#8221; is still hyperlinked. But rather than &#8220;you&#8221; linking to your Twitter account, it actually links to @you.And this guy does not like you.@You, whose name is Wallace, hasn&#8217;t tweeted in almost a year.

Chapple, who was a director at Yahoo since August 2008, is said to want to &#8220;devote more time to his other business interests&#8221; instead.The real reason is that Chapple is a close associate of Carl Icahn, who resigned from Yahoo&#8217;s board in October 2009 after basically wrestling his way into the company&#8217;s top management team back in July 2008 (remember the Microsoft saga?). With him gone from the Yahoo board, there really wasn&#8217;t much reason for Chapple to stick around.John Chapple is President of equity firm Hawkeye Investments. Prior to forming Hawkeye, he served as President, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Nextel Partners from January 1998 to June 2006, when the company was purchased by Sprint. Chapple serves on the board of directors of several telecommunications companies: Cbeyond, Leap Wireless International and privately held companies Seamobile Enterprises  and Telesphere Networks. With him resigning from Yahoo&#8217;s board, the only other person from the Icahn posse left is Frank Biondi, former Chairman and CEO of Universal Studios and Viacom before that.I wouldn&#8217;t bet on him sticking around much longer either, though.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Placecast, a startup that creates a location-based mobile marketing technology, has raised $3 million in Series B funding from Quatrex Capital, ONSET Ventures and Voyager Capital. This brings Placecast&#8217;s total funding to $8 million. Placecast recently debuted its technology, called ShopAlerts, that allows retailers bring people into their stores by sending them text messages when they get near their retail outlets.  Here&#8217;s how ShopAlerts works. Consumers can opt-in to receiving text messages in a variety of waysâ\\x80\\x94at the store, online, via text-message, mobile websites or on Facebook. Once the technology has been activated, consumers will be alerted when they are near a location that they are interested in or when the brand is offering sales and specials. ShopAlerts&#8217; technology uses &#8220;geo-fences,&#8221; which are virtual boundaries that can be targeted via location-based marketing. Retailers can customize alerts to fit their brand and strategy. On the consumer side, ShopAlerts will only send maximum number of 3 messages within a given week from a retailer. And users can opt out of the program by texting &#8220;stop&#8221; back to a text message. One of the benefits of ShopAlerts is that it works on both smartphones and non-smartphones, making it a compelling source of marketing and advertising for the 196 million Americans who do not own smartphones but may be interested in shopping alerts. Placecast will be using the new funding to accelerate the development and distribution of ShopAlerts. Since September 2009, the ShopAlerts service has run pilot programs across the U.S. with several major retailers including North Face, American Eagle Outfitters, and REI. The startup also offers a location-based advertising platform that weaves together location information and other data from audiences across the web, mobile, and email. Placecast will analyze inventory, segments audiences and targets ads for maximum relevance for advertisers and publishers. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Well, I was wrong. It is possible to balance those competing goals. And nowhere is it illustrated better than this ridiculous decision that Facebook game publishers are forced to make when monetizing their apps via Super Rewards. There is literally a slider with one end that says &#8220;monetization&#8221; and the other end that says &#8220;user experience.&#8221;Publishers are faced with a choice. Be good to users and don&#8217;t monetize well, which means less revenue to plow back into Facebook to advertise your games. You lose market share and disappear. We&#8217;ve had publishers tell us before that the worst offers are the ones that make the most money. People disagreed. I&#8217;m not sure how they&#8217;ll disagree now that they see the decision that publishers have to make:Monetization or User Experience.Are the publishers who chose monetization wrong? Yes, but they must do it to survive. Is Super Rewards wrong for pushing bad offers? Yes. (oh, yes). But as we&#8217;ve said before, Facebook is the ultimate offender. They make the rules. The more flexible the rules, the more money flows back to them in advertising. There is a direct relationship between the evil dial and Facebook&#8217;s revenues. Facebook must set the rules so that the dial is permanently set to Not Evil, and then let the advertising play out from there. Otherwise they risk real long term brand damage. Users must know that Facebook is protecting them. That is a rule that can&#8217;t be bent. And bent it is, all the time.More on Scamville here.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When&#8217;s the last time you were at a Blockbuster?For me, it&#8217;s been a few years. And it&#8217;s been several years since I was going regularly. And I was only doing that because the then-Viacom-backed-giant drove the mom and pop video stores out of business in my community. I have no desire to ever step into a Blockbuster store ever again. But Warner Bros. sure wants me to.Today, Blockbuster announced it has reached a deal with Warner Bros. to ensure the studio&#8217;s new titles would be available in Blockbuster stores and by mail the day they are released on DVD. This is significant because Warner recently negotiated deals with Blockbuster rivals Netflix and Redbox to give them such access only after the movies have been available to purchase on DVD for 28 days. In other words, Warner just screwed Netflix and Redbox.So why would Warner do such a thing? Well, in their release, they make it sound as if the two sides have long been friends (BFFs for over 25 years!) and they want to continue that relationship. But the reality is more complex.Obviously, this all boils down to money. The financial terms of the deal aren&#8217;t stated, so it&#8217;s hard to know if Blockbuster is actually paying more than Netflix would have (more on that below). But regardless of that, it seems to me that the line of thinking by Warner may simply be to pretend it&#8217;s the early-to-mid 2000s and the DVD business is booming.Back then, Blockbuster dominated rentals and more importantly for Warner, DVD sales were on fire. In fact, in quite a few cases, studios were making quite a bit more off of DVD sales than off the box office take for a film. DVDs became the golden calf of the industry.But over the past few years, that calf has been slaughtered. Warner clearly believes it&#8217;s because of services like Netflix and Redbox make renting movies too easy, and thus, decrease the need to buy DVDs. That&#8217;s true, but Warner&#8217;s response is faulty logic at best, and idiotic at worst.The truth is that the vast majority of movies have never been worth owning. People were only buying them in droves over the past decade because renting from Blockbuster (driving to the store, paying late fees, etc) was a pain in the ass. Once an easier and more convenient way to rent came along (Netflix), consumers awoke to the realization that there are very few movies actually worth owning. But even if it wasn&#8217;t Netflix that came along, some other method of distribution (such as the Internet) would have, and DVD sales still would have shrunk.So now, Warner is cutting preferred deals like the Blockbuster one in an attempt to make renting movies more of a pain in the ass once again. Brilliant.But still, why not give Blockbuster the same raw deal they gave to Netflix? I&#8217;d imagine part of it is because Blockbuster has all those retail stores that sell DVDs as well as rent them. The availability of new releases (which again, Netflix and Redbox won&#8217;t have) will get people into the stores, and in Warner&#8217;s logic, get them potentially buying DVDs from there.And there&#8217;s another reason: Blockbuster itself is a wounded calf. The company recently warned that it may have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it&#8217;s drowning in debt (thanks in large part to the aforementioned stores). Warner likely got a sweet deal from Blockbuster in an effort to save the struggling company. And if, by some miracle, Blockbuster is saved, they&#8217;re likely to get that same sweet deal over and over again.The problem with all of this is that it won&#8217;t work. People are not going to start buying DVDs like they were a decade ago, again. The window has closed. We&#8217;re moving to a time of distribution over the Internet, but rather than get out in front of that, Warner is inexplicably propping up dinosaurs like Blockbuster.While there is validity that many consumers don&#8217;t care all that much about when a DVD is released, there are millions that do. For example, Sherlock Holmes was a very popular film this past year. When it comes out on DVD next week, neither Netflix or Redbox will have it available to rent â\\x80\\x94 but Blockbuster will. Consumers will be confused as to why this is.Short term, this may prop up Blockbuster a bit, and may even slightly boost DVD sales. But long term, money-grabbing shenanigans like this that screw consumers will only lead to one thing: piracy.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The room is packed with with some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most highly regarded VCs, angel investors, and entrepreneurs.Demo Day has always drawn big crowds, but as the Y Combinator program has matured the quality of startups presenting has gotten noticably better (I remember being thoroughly impressed by many of the companies that launched in the last batch).  Today&#8217;s companies look like they&#8217;ll be continuing that trend, even though many of them are only three months old.Some of the companies presenting today have already launched; we&#8217;ll provide a brief recap of what they&#8217;re up to, and then link to our past coverage.Gamador &#8211; Gamador is a social game developer that has released three games so far.  The company says that it differentiates itself from other developers by releasing quick, smart games at a very rapid pace (they can develop a game in about a week. The company has built its own analytics platform for social games called Rankador, which they liken to a &#8216;PageRank for social games&#8217;.Etacts &#8211; Etacts, which launched in February, is a service to help ensure that you keep in touch with the friends and colleagues you care about. It can help prioritize messages, alert you if you&#8217;re falling out of touch with someone, and more.  It was also the first service to implement oAuth for Gmail.500friends &#8211; For use by online retailers, 500friends is designed to encourage users to share products with their friends on social media services by offering incentives.Zencoder &#8211; Zencoder is AWS for video. Customers include on2 (recently acquired by Google), drupal, and Posterous.  The service handles transcoding, video delivery, and advertising.Launch Hear- A platform to help companies reach out to bloggers â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0a &#8220;digital isthmus&#8221;.  Send emails that bloggers want to receive, but that companies will pay to send. Host conferences called Swagapalooza to connect with PR/bloggers.Embedster- Allows bloggers to serve an ad for any YouTube they display on their site.  Even if you just have a link to the video, Embedster can serve up a slick overlay that plays an ad before following the link.Infoharmoni &#8211; Infoharmoni is a platform for visualizing real-time data, which can be drawn from platforms like Twitter and Foursquare.  The company previously wrote a guest post providing an analysis of the real-time data around Techcrunch50.Data Marketplace &#8211; Data Marketplace launched last week, helping pair financial organizations when the data they want. It also allows people who have compiled data sets to put them up for sale, for purchase by general consumers.Nowmov &#8211; With founders that include two former Apple engineers, Nowmov is looking to reinvent the way we watch video, pulling in content from Twitter and showing it to you in a TV-like experience.Greplin â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Data used to be stored on your desktop, now it&#8217;s scattered across a dozen services on the web.  Greplin wants to help you find your data that&#8217;s in the cloud, no matter which service it&#8217;s stored on.  Think of it as a Google for your personal data (or a Spotlight for the cloud).Notifo is a service that makes it extremely easy for other sites and applications to integrate mobile push notifications.

You can read our initial review of the site here. Viralheat is making its platform more comprehensive by now allowing users to track mentions on Facebook. The platform now allows brands, agencies, and marketers to measure impact on Facebook by culling total shares, likes, comments, updates and more. Viralheat is also boosting its analysis of &#8220;influencers,&#8221; or the people talking about a brand on a given social media site. Viralheat now offers a complete 360-degree view of any author, with a map of an influencer&#8217;s reach across various social media platforms and services. With an integration with Klout, a startup that measures influence across Twitter, Viralheat allows agencies and marketers to look at a user&#8217;s behavior and give the users a score based upon influence. Additionally, Viralheat has integrated with Twitalyzer,  a similar analytics application that measures Twitter users&#8217; influence by number of retweets, followers, and more. The competition is steep in the social media space, with Viralheat competing with a plethora of startups and companies, including  Radian6, Visible Measures, Omgili, ScoutLabs, and Omniture. . One advantage of Viralheat is its price. The site is affordableâ\\x80\\x94for $10 per month, you can track 10 profiles on the site. For $40 per month, you can track 50 profiles.

It&#8217;s not the ad network&#8217;s fault, it&#8217;s the publishers who use them. Right Media VP Bennie Smith says &#8220;Partnering with a third-party ad network is a good thing, but you can&#8217;t remove all the risk and shift all the responsibility to the ad network&#8230;The user is coming to your site, not to the ad network. The primary responsibility still resides with you.&#8221;haha. not really. Or at least it was a response to a different story.Smith said that in response to another article where malware popped up on TechCrunch via an ad network. He likely said it after checking that we don&#8217;t serve Yahoo ads. He was in the clear. And yes, I made a mental note about it at the time.Yahoo&#8217;s actual response now that they are sending the malware directly: &#8220;We have identified the creatives in question and are working to make sure they been deactivated in our system,&#8221;.Why is Google way down on the list of bad guys in serving Malware? &#8220;&#8221;The Google portion of JS:Prontexi is quite small and has gotten visibly even smaller as they have taken steps to improve the situation,&#8221; Sejtko said. &#8220;That is not the case with Yahoo and Fox.&#8221;\"Yahoo&#8217;s attitude seems to have remained the same from the first article to the second &#8211; this is the publisher&#8217;s issue, not theirs, and they have apparently been ignoring the problem. I think it would have been so much more fun if they just trashed their entire publisher network instead and gave the old Bennie Smith quote again today.But the fact is that there is a trust relationship between a publisher and an ad network. There is little a publisher can do to stop malware once it hits the ad network. The fact that some of this stuff hits Google.com and Yahoo.com and other major sites with thousands of employees illustrates this perfectly. Malware must be stopped at the Ad Network, and it&#8217;s a relatively simple thing to do at that stage. Unless you&#8217;re Yahoo, I guess.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'HeyZap, the startup that makes it easy for publishers to integrate casual games into their sites, is entering a very hot new territory today: social gaming.  The company has partnered with fifteen social game developers, and will be integrating their games into the HeyZap platform over the next few weeks. Â\\xa0That&#8217;s significant, because it means that these games will be available on the 150,000 sites across the web that have integrated HeyZap in addition to Facebook proper.The new functionality works using Facebook Connect (all of the social game partners have already deployed their games on Facebook, so they don&#8217;t have to make any changes). After a publisher embeds the HeyZap widget onto their site, users can log in and play as if they were on Facebook, with the same virtual goods, stats, and social graph they&#8217;ve already established.Among the 15 social game partners are Aeria Games, Game Duell, and TheBroth; featured publishers include eBaum&#8217;s World, hi5, and Webs. Hoop Fever Live from TheBroth and FishStory from RacoonX will be available starting today, with the rest of the initial game partners rolling out in the next few weeks. Â\\xa0Co-founderÂ\\xa0ImmadÂ\\xa0AkhundÂ\\xa0says thatÂ\\xa0HeyZapÂ\\xa0is hoping to integrate more social gaming companies in the near future.HeyZap handles the payment system, with publishers receiving 15% of the proceeds, and HeyZap and the game developer split the remainder 30/70 (in the developer&#8217;s favor).  Here are some of the more technical details HeyZap gave us on how this works:Heyzap works with Facebook Connect APIs and simulates all the classic viral loops that Facebook developers use inside of Facebook including stream posting, gifting and inviting friends. Heyzap offers a full API suite for packaging the social game in a single SWF without the need for Javascript usage; which enables the viral swf distribution seen in casual games and online video. Alternatively, developers that have non-flash games can use Heyzapâ\\x80\\x99s iframe solution, which allows all social games to be ported outside of Facebook.com whether they use flash or not.It&#8217;s possible for social games to use Facebook Connect to expand beyond Facebook without HeyZap&#8217;s help â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0we saw Zynga do just that when it launched a version of FarmVille at farmville.com and MSN games.  But HeyZap&#8217;s system makes it easy for publishers who may not have the knowhow to integrate Facebook Connect to do this, and it handles all of the arrangements with the game developers.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The Chinese government is definitely not pleased with Google right now.  In response to Google&#8217;s decision yesterday to stop self-censoring its search engine and other sites in China by redirecting them to its site in Hong Kong, China is now censoring some search queries itself. A Google spokesperson confirms to us &#8220;it seems that certain sensitive queries are being blocked. However, the Google.com.hk site is not currently being blocked.&#8221;  Checks with contacts inside China also confirm that the Hong Kong site remains accessible.In an article today, the New York Times is reporting: mainland Chinese users on Tuesday could not see uncensored Hong Kong content because government computers had either disabled searches for objectionable content completely or blocked links to certain results.Google maintains a page showing the availability of its various services in mainland China. However, that page has not been updated since March 21.  Google tells us it will update the page soon.  In addition to censoring &#8220;sensitive queries,&#8221; China is also beginning to possibly shut Google out of other Chinese markets.  The New York Times reports that the Chinese government is pressuring China Mobile to kill a mobile search deal with Google, and that China Unicom may cancel its plans to launch an Android phone.Google is engaged in high stakes corporate foreign policy with China.  It is taking a very technical approach to dealing with China, doing whatever it can to stay within the letter of Chinese law while no longer continuing to act as an arm of the Chinese censors.  That&#8217;s how it came up with the idea to redirect Chinese users to its Hong Kong servers, where different rules apply.  In a post yesterday, Google&#8217;s chief legal officer David Drummond noted that the &#8220;itâ\\x80\\x99s entirely legal.&#8221;  Maybe so, but that doesn&#8217;t mean China won&#8217;t retaliate in both overt and covert ways.  By literally distancing itself from China, Google is publicly snubbing the Chinese government.  Chinese officials do not like to be publicly snubbed.  They will likely retaliate in an effort to teach Google a lesson.  Google may very well have just &#8220;lost&#8221; China as a market.  But it knew that when it decided to stop playing by China&#8217;s rules.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': \"Everbread, a new travel search startup, is de-cloaking out of stealth today. The startup has put into alpha testing a new search platform that claims to be substantially faster than traditional travel search engines. It&#8217;s also doing something unusual &#8211; integrating a number of low cost airline carriers. Normally customers must go to these individually as the big travel search engines are usually locked out.Everbread&#8217;s proprietary B2B fares and pricing engine, Haystack, is going to be aimed at airlines, online travel agencies, and travel consortia to let them offer cheaper fares on a greater number of flights. So, for example, you could create a trip which involves flying a major airline to London and then hopping on a low cost airline for that last leg in Europe. That&#8217;s significant and it&#8217;s not something you can do right now with one engine. It means the travel portals which Everbread signs deals with could potentially combine special deals and last minute offers they have negotiated with specific airlines.Everbread is running a showcase called Flydini.com which is not a live site allowing bookings but a demo for the travel industry.The company is based in London but, in a quintessential European startup model, its core team of 30+ developers are actually based in Sophia, Bulgaria. Finance-wise it&#8217;s privately backed by two angels. But perhaps most interestingly the CEO is one Morten Lund, who resurfaced recently as an advisor to another startup, Tradeshift. Lund is still in a personal bankruptcy period, but, he tells me, he is a &#8220;hired gun&#8221; for Everbread rather than having a stake, which is currently forbidden under the terms of his bankruptcy. Lund famously backed Skype in the early days and online stockbroker Zecco. [He'll be speaking at GeeknRolla]. The rest of the consists of Assen Vassilev, a former founder and CEO of an online travel portal and a Harvard grad; CTO Ashley Raiteri, a former rocket scientist for the United States Defense and Aerospace Industry and COO Alexander Staun.We&#8217;ve also learned that Everbread  is working in close cooperation with Ypsilon.net in the German market which delivers internet booking engines to 88,000 websites in Germany, and working on a number of deals with large online travel agencies and meta-search players.The company has attracted an experienced board. Vagn Sorensen is a former CEO of Austrian Airlines, Montie Brewer is former CEO of Air Canada and Michael Jackson is a former CTO of Skype.  Obviously you don&#8217;t do that without attracting attention and I gather the movement of these guys to Everbread are rippling though the travel industry right now.Lund told me: &#8220;Airlines and Online Travel Agencies are cold-calling us. Everbread is the deepest and most hardcore technology I have ever been involved with.&#8221; Heavy words, but if it works Everbread could solve one of the core problems with the the $2 trillion travel industry.  The timing is significant. Google is rumoured to be working on dedicated Travel search engine and it&#8217;s been spotted testing hotel prices in Google Maps. It is also understood to be looking at acquisitions in travel search.One of Google&#8217;s possibly targets could be ITA Software. In the US the company now powers several airline websites and Orbitz for their US domestic traffic.  However, ITA has been largely unsuccessful in solving the more complicated problem of international search and has not integrated any of the low cost carriers.If that acquisition does happen &#8211; and we hear it&#8217;s on the cards &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s Bing (which has a referral deal with Orbitz) would end up being powered by Google-owned search technology on their US domestic airfare queries. Quite an interesting situation.Travel search technology is notoriously expensive to develop. Most travel search worldwide is handled by three &#8220;GDCs&#8221; or Global Distribution Companies &#8211;  Travelport, Sabre and Amadeus. These power the most popular websites (Travelocity, Last Minute.com, Orbitz and Expedia).  The search they provide is quite expensive, still mostly run on mainframes and is under a lot of financial pressure from people shopping around at the same time as a downturn in travel purchasing.CrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The beauty of the Internet is that it demands instant analysis of every single development to come out of Peoria. The Nintendo 3DS&mdash;out of Kyoto, which is not Peoria, I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;was announced overnight, time zone permitting. It will debut at E3 in June, and it will forever change the way you and I&#8230; do something. Something video game-related, methinks.If one thing&#8217;s certain, it does mean that 3D is here to stay. I&#8217;m sorry. Say what you will about Avatar, but it made quite a bit of scratch. Then CES came around, in January, and every single TV manufacturer held presentation after presentation, laser light show after laser light show, trumpeting their fancy 3D TVs. None of the TVs are compatible with each other, so if you buy Company A&#8217;s TV and your neighbor buys Company B&#8217;s, y&#8217;all can&#8217;t get together to watch the World Cup in 3D&mdash;the glasses won&#8217;t allow it.The GameCube barely displaced any water&mdash;what did it have, those Metroid games, Resident Evil 4, a couple of Mario games? It did well enough, but compared to the PS2 (and Xbox, I guess) the GameCube was sorta a disappointment. Granted, comparing any other video game system to the PS2 is like comparing a light bulb to the sun, but you can only beat what&#8217;s put in front of you.Wii! Yup, Nintendo got tired of the hardware race, so it slapped a Bluetooth sensor bar to white shelled GameCube, called it Wii, then sat back and let the money a-roll in. It completely changed gaming. Now, rather than relying upon the &#8220;hardcores&#8221; to buy the latest Earthbound, Nintendo could convince Grandma and Grandpa, and your girlfriend, to play Wii Sports till their arms fall off.You&#8217;ll note that it took Sony and Microsoft a few years before they realized, &#8220;Hey, this motion control business is quite nifty. Maybe we should get in on it?&#8221;And they have! I have no time for motion control&mdash;you can pry my mouse and keyboard from my cold, dead hands~!&mdash;but clearly there&#8217;s money to be made here. If Sony and Microsoft can&#8217;t make money selling Fling Paint, then there&#8217;s no money to publish things like God of War and Fable.So this 3DS thing (here&#8217;s the full English press release)&#8230; Nintendo describes it as letting you play games &#8220;with 3D effects without the need for any special glasses.&#8221; As someone who wears glasses&mdash;I&#8217;m blind as a bat, and nowhere near as cuddly&mdash;, let me be the nine millionth to say &#8220;Obrigado!&#8221; The 3D TVs at CES were largely pants, but I did get to play Battlefield: Bad Company 2 in 3D (thanks to some sort of Nvidia trickery) a few weeks ago. It didn&#8217;t blow my mind or anything, but if given the option, provided it&#8217;s affordable&mdash;I&#8217;m not buying a $1,000 monitor and glasses and a new video card!&mdash;then why not? Nothing wrong, per se, with a little added depth as I try to left-click over a Bad Guy&#8217;s face.The 3DS, which should come out around this time next year, will be backwards compatible with your current DS library. My DS library is quite small (Chrono Trigger and those Final Fantasy remakes), so I could give a toss about backwards compatibility, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s those of you who have more than a few games, games that you wouldn&#8217;t want to &#8220;lose&#8221; when upgrading to the 3DS.Upgrading may not even be the right word, since the 3DS is totally new hardware. It&#8217;s not like going from the DS Lite to the DSi, or from the DSi to the DSi XL.The point is, this is Nintendo saying, &#8220;Hi guys! Remember how we made motion control cool, bringing it to the masses? We&#8217;re going to do the same thing with 3D now. Kthxbye!&#8221;And now we wait for Sony to announce a 3D PSP of some sort&#8230;',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m not sure if this is a must-have item for everyone, but I have to admit there is something interesting about Blue Lounge&#8217;s new device called the Mojito. Spied on the trade show floor at SXSW Interactive 2010, it is part of my post trip download.Certainly, the goal of the Mojito is to free you from the bondage of countless, annoying alerts cycling on your computer as each social network to which you belong cries out for attentionâ\\x80\\x94and it could succeed. But somehow I wonder if the $299 price tag will relegate it to the &#8220;Sharper Image-esque&#8221; island of misfit toys for executive desks. Maybe not though. It could look smashing in a kitchen or corporate public space and could definitely keep you from pulling your iPhone out of your pocket every thirty seconds, for updates. Truly that seems to be one of the benefits the Mojito offers; it relaxes social media a tad and puts it a bit more in the background.The design is nice (if not a tad thick for these Apple days of anorexic industrial design) and the keyboardless concept, while at first a bit confusing, ultimately makes sense for a concept which aims to take social media out of your face and move it about thirty inches to the side of you desk while formatting it as an elegant slide show. Honestly, I think it&#8217;s a good and noble idea and I would want one, but I am not sure I could justify 300 bucks for it (without becoming an executive type, in which case I probably wouldn&#8217;t need it anyway because people would then be typing out my twitter feed andÂ\\xa0 and reading it to me while I play golf, right?). Just kidding.My guess is people will be hacking this thing immediately.It&#8217;s not out yet, but there is more info at mymojito.com and Alan from Blue Lounge was kind enough to give us a little demo below.',\n",

But shaking it is half the fun, especially when apps take advantage of the built-in accelerometer to turn shaking into a feature.  One of the earliest apps to make shaking a central element of its interface was Urbanspoon, the restaurant recommender.  You shake the slot-machine inspired app to find nearby restaurants.Since launching in the summer of 2008, Urbanspoon&#8217;s iPhone app has been shaken more than half a billion times.  The app has been installed more than 9 million times, and continues to be popular (currently it is the No. 5 most popular free app in the Travel category, right after Yelp). Since being acquired by IAC last year (it is now part of the Citysearch business), its Website has also grown.  According to Citysearch&#8217;s internal numbers, Urbanspoon.com is getting 7 million monthly unique visitors, up 220 percent from a year ago right before the acquisition.  Comscore shows 2.3 million monthly uniques worldwide as of January, 2010, and 1.8 million in the U.S. as of February, 2010, with 129 percent and 83 percent annual growth respectively.  (Comscore&#8217;s numbers are estimates, but they corroborate the upward trend in traffic reported by Citysearch).  Below is the U.S. chart from comScore:CrunchBase Information',\n",

Yahooâ\\x80\\x99s basic Search app tries to bring an enhanced version of Yahoo Search to the iPhone with plenty of bells and whistles, while Yahooâ\\x80\\x99s Sketch-a-Search iPhone app is aimed towards discovering local restaurantsYahoo&#8217;s Search app includes the ability to refine results based on your location. The app will also autosuggest local keywords when you type a query into the search box. The app delivers local content, with photos, ratings, phone numbers and more from Yahoo Local,  Yelp and Citysearch. And the app includes voice search so you can speak your query. To clear a query, you shake your phone. Yahoo&#8217;s Sketch-a-Search is a little more of a unique offering. To conduct a search, you use your finger to draw a circle or boundary on your phone&#8217;s map to look up businesses within that location. The app defaults to the users&#8217; current location, and also allows people to search for a specific city, or area. The app initially will only deliver results for restaurants in given areas but will launch other local categories in the near future. Within the results, you can refine restaurants by cuisine, ambiance, and star rating. You can click on restaurants to read reviews, browse photos, get directions, or make a phone call from within the app. It&#8217;s similar in some ways to the functionality of Yelp or CitySearch.Yahoo is definitely late in the game to launch a search app in the App Store. The much younger Microsoft Bing launched a search iPhone app in December.  Yahoo Search on the web has been steadily losing marketshare since Bing arrived on the search scene. And with the search deal with Microsoft finally approved, Yahoo search will go through another transition. Microsoft will take over Yahoo&#8217;s organic and paid search results and blend those resources into Bing. Yahoo will continue to control the front-end UI of search on Yahoo&#8217;s sites, and consumers will continue to see and be able to use the Yahoo search engine. CrunchBase Information',\n",

You can teach it to recognize new objects and by aiming it at a product, the program can tell what it is using real speech and when you need to ID something on the fly, you can stick on an image sticker and read that sticker. It&#8217;s more or less a barcode and QR scanner with some image recognition thrown in, but it really could be a boon to those with failing &#8211; or failed &#8211; eyesight.The system needs a little more computing power than is available in the average smartphone so you need a local PC to help ID some things. The machine learning works like this:Users running the LookTel Mobile software, which runs on compatible Windows Mobile Smartphones, use the cell phoneâ\\x80\\x99s touch-screen interface to navigate and the cell phone&#8217;s camera to recognize objects. The LookTel Mobile software transmits the live images from the cell phone to a PC running LookTel BaseStation, our sophisticated recognition software. When the PC receives a request to look up an image, it sorts through the image library to find the matching image stored in the database. It then sends back the information that permits the Smartphone to speak the description of the item to you.LookTel &#8220;learns&#8221; to recognize new items by storing an image of the item, captured by the Smartphone, and matching it with a tag. The tag can be your own voice or a text tag that is read by the text-to-speech engine, similar to what your home PC can do.There is also a live-assistant portion that lets human beings tell you what&#8217;s going on around you as you point your phone&#8217;s camera at the scene. It works with Windows smartphones and MIDs.There is no current pricing &#8211; I have an email into the company &#8211; but I looks like a great idea.

The app is designed for travel spontaneity. Travelers can arrive at a destination, turn on their device, touch the â\\x80\\x9cNear Meâ\\x80\\x9d button, and find recommendations for nearby activities, restaurants, nightlife, hotels and more. Users can refine these recommendations by filtering with preferences such as â\\x80\\x9cromantic,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9coff the beaten path,â\\x80\\x9d or by searching based on activity type such as museums, spas or golf courses.

Users can also plan trips in advance by touching â\\x80\\x9cWhere Toâ\\x80\\x9d button from the Home screen, choose any destination, and start building an itinerary before they arrive. And the app features much of the guidebook-like content that NileGuide includes on its web site. NileGuide also has a free iPhone app that integrates more of the travel itinerary-creation functionality that is included on the startup&#8217;s website. While the travel app industry is a competitive space, this new app from NileGuide could be an incredibly useful tool for on-the-go recommendations with a location-based twists.

Like when you&#8217;re talking about all of the users of the Internet in the world.Today, OpenDNS is announcing that over one percent of the world&#8217;s Internet users are using its services. It&#8217;s the first DNS provider to hit such a milestone, and it means that over 18 million people are using the service to access the web in a way that founder and CEO David Ulevitch calls &#8220;safer, faster, smarter and more reliable.&#8220;And that usage number has doubled in just the last 12 months, according to Ulevitch.That type of growth is important because a new, big time player just entered the ring: Google. But despite the big name, and the right price (free), the results for Google&#8217;s DNS offering have varied. And in a test we ran with Google&#8217;s own Namebench product, OpenDNS easily beat Google in DNS speed.The truth is that most users have no idea what any of these DNS services do, or how to go about changing them. So companies like OpenDNS have to rely on partnerships with schools (they have over 25,000), partnerships with large corporations (they have them with many Fortune 500 companies), or parents really worried about what their children are surfing for on the web. But again, the growth is clearly happening, and actually picking up speed, according to Ulevitch, so that&#8217;s a very good sign.An even better sign: OpenDNS has been profitable since 2007.[photo: flickr/jurvetson]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Mobile advertising company AdMarvel, fresh off the heels of being acquired by Opera Software for a reported $8 million plus earn-out, has teamed up with Gannett subsidiary PointRoll to launch an advertising platform for Apple&#8217;s iPad.Dubbed the iPad Advertising Platform, the companies aim to combine PointRollâ\\x80\\x99s rich media technology with AdMarvelâ\\x80\\x99s mobile advertising capabilities.The launch of the platform is part of a broader partnership between both companies, who will develop cross-platform solutions for ad mediation, campaign management, ad serving and analytics tailored to the latest mobile devices and operating systems.AdMarvel boasts about its cross-browser, cross-application SDK for developers to build services that include rich media advertising options for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch and other mobile applications including Android and Blackberry. Developers can source from some  60 ad networks from around the globe to deliver geo-targeted ads.In turn, marketers and ad networks can tap into the platform to manage campaigns,  targeting and frequency control and get clear performance metrics.The iPad Advertising Platform is said to support JavaScript, expandable ad units, animation, interstitials, transparent overlays of content and interaction. The platform also supports in-app advertising units for the promotion of new features or content channels. Finally, the iPad Advertising Platform features click-to-contact, click-to-maps, click-to-app and click-to-video actions.AdMarvel / PointRoll is far from the only one coming up with solutions for Apple&#8217;s iPad &#8211; rival Mobclix released its iPad SDK just last week.And to think Apple has yet to commence shipping the first iPad units to early adopters.(Source: press release)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This morning, the Internet was abuzz with the news that Apple would begin selling unlocked iPhones. The only problem? It&#8217;s not true. In fact, it&#8217;s no different from what Apple did last year at this time: sell contract-free iPhones at unsubsidized prices.But that doesn&#8217;t mean this move is entirely uninteresting. You may be wondering why Apple is doing this? And why now? Well, it seems fairly obvious that&#8217;s it&#8217;s an attempt to move inventory before a new piece of iPhone hardware launches in the June or July timeframe. Remember, that&#8217;s just a few short months away already.When Apple first ships its iPhone hardware, it requires that you also purchase an AT&amp;T contract with the device. This is both practical (supplies are tighter), but also because AT&amp;T pays Apple a ton of money for each subsidized iPhone sold. But as time goes on and new hardware nears, Apple is more concerned with moving existing inventory to make way for the new device.A $500, $600, or $700 (depending on the model and size) phone isn&#8217;t going to sell a ton of units â\\x80\\x94 especially since it&#8217;s not unlocked â\\x80\\x94 but there will be those who pay the premium to ship it overseas or are comfortable doing the relatively painless process of unlocking the phone themselves (which voids the warranty). Unfortunately, in the U.S., even if it is unlocked, the phone will only be able to work on T-Mobile as well as AT&amp;T, since those are the two (major) GSM carriers. A different chip (CDMA) would have to be in the iPhone for it to work on the nation&#8217;s biggest network, Verizon (or Sprint, for that matter).Because of the price and restrictions, this move will probably have minimal impact on actual sales. So don&#8217;t be surprised if when the fourth generation iPhone is announced, if we also hear about a price cut for the current iPhone 3GS down to $99 (just as Apple did last year with the iPhone 3G).So, it was a nice pipe-dream for a few hours this morning that Apple was going to be changing its policy and selling the iPhone unlocked (as Google offers as an option for its Nexus One). After all, many would take it as a sign that they&#8217;ve grown weary of AT&amp;T and could soon partner with another carrier in the U.S. But really, this is just the first of undoubtedly many signs that a new iPhone is coming.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': \"In late 2009 we wrote about Tapjoy&#8217;s evolution from a mobile app developer to a mobile app monetization platform.Tomorrow, Offerpal Media, one of the giants in social gaming monetization, will announce the acquisition of Tapjoy. That gives Offerpal a beachhead into the mobile space, an area they have only dipped their toes into to date.The company helps applications like Tap Tap Revenge monetize users. The vast majority of revenue comes via pay-for-installs on other mobile apps, meaning users are paid virtual currency to download other mobile applications (on Tap Tap Revenge 3, it takes about 3 installs of free apps to get enough credits for a free song download). Developers have access to turnkey software to easily add monetization and analytics tools to their iPhone, Android and other mobile apps. Tapjoy keeps between 1/3 and 1/2 of the revenue, passing the rest on to publishers.They are &#8220;very profitable,&#8221; say the founders.Tapjoy &#8220;dovetails nicely&#8221; with Offerpal&#8217;s existing offers and monetization platform, says Offerpal CEO George Garrick. Tapjoy, founded Lee Linden and Ben Lewis, has been integrated into apps by &#8220;more than 1,000&#8243; developers and reaches 25 million mobile consumers.Offerpal isn&#8217;t saying what the size of the transaction is, or how much revenue Tapjoy is generating to date. It&#8217;s growing fast from a small base, though. Tapjoy says &#8220;annual installs, user base and revenue is expected to quadruple this year.&#8221; Our guess after asking a few of their customers is that revenue is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per month.Tapjoy raised just one round of funding &#8211; $600,000 from Tugboat Ventures in early 2009.The Tapjoy founders dropped by our office at about 11 pm for a quick video to talk about the company and the acquisition:\\t\\t\\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t\\t\\trunMobileCompatibilityScript('myExperience73306335001');\\tCrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s hard to feel sorry for a wildly successful author, but in the case of Michael Lewis I&#8217;ll make an exception. Just this once.Lewis&#8217; latest book &#8211; The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine &#8211; was published less than a week ago and has already reached the number one sales rank spot on Amazon. It&#8217;s an impressive feat, especially for a serious piece of non-fiction writing with nary a wizard, a vampire or an ancient code that&#8217;s &#8211; holy shit! &#8211; hidden in plain sight to boost its sales. But the feat is made all the more impressive by the fact that many of the book&#8217;s reviews are, without a word of exaggeration, so negative that they&#8217;d made a Nuremberg verdict look upbeat and generous.At the time of writing there are 64 one star reviews &#8211; more than the total number of 2-5 star review combined &#8211; sending a clear message to potential purchasers: this book might be popular but it&#8217;s also a total sack of crap. Don&#8217;t waste your money.There&#8217;s just one problem with that message: less than half of those one star reviews are actually reviewing the book.Instead, most of the reviewers&#8217; ire relates to the fact that publishers WW Norton have decided not to release a Kindle version of the book at the same time as its hardback release. Writes one (pretty representative) reviewer by the name of Ben Kaplan:&#8220;I&#8217;d like to add my name to the list of people who are very disappointed that this book does not have a Kindle edition. No, I haven&#8217;t read the book, but I want to &#8212; on my Kindle! If all these one star reviews lead to fewer sales, I think that would be a great result and an excellent lesson for the author/publisher.&#8221;Go, Ben!No, seriously, go.I&#8217;ve written before about the flawed thinking of publishers who delay Kindle releases to protect hardback sales. It&#8217;s an idiotic move but  it&#8217;s one that many publishers feel forced into due to Amazon&#8217;s policy of charging $9.99 for most popular Kindle titles. It&#8217;s loss-leader pricing for Amazon and publishers still get their full due, but the low digital price point discourages hardback sales which results &#8211; in the short term at least &#8211; in a drop in overall revenues.As someone who has spent hundreds of dollars on a Kindle, I completely understand the frustration of those who are irritated at having to wait until the paperback release of a book before they can get hold of  digital copy. But the idea that one star reviews will provide &#8220;an excellent lesson for the author&#8221; to release their ebooks earlier is bullshit of the lowest order.I speak from pained experience as an author when I say that we have absolutely no say on when our books are released, in what format and at what price. And yet we&#8217;re the ones who have the most to lose from negative Amazon reviews. A book&#8217;s overall star rating is one of the most prominent pieces of information on an Amazon page and many readers &#8211; quite reasonably &#8211; equate a low average rating with a poorly written book. This damages sales of the book and also damages our reputations as writers. Almost nobody &#8211; unless they click through and read the full text of the negative reviews &#8211; sees a one star rating and assumes its a comment on the decision by the publisher to withhold an electronic edition.Barry Ritholtz, economics commentator and author of Bailout Nation, has written an excellent blog post on the subject, describing the one-star reviews as &#8220;nothing more than collective bullying. &#8216;Give me your lunch money (kindle version), or I will beat you up during recess (give you one star reviews)&#8221; and calling for Amazon to change their review policy.Ritholz is right &#8211; but this it&#8217;s a problem that goes far beyond this current Kindle spat. Amazon&#8217;s book review policy has long been a bugbear of mine, and most other authors&#8217;. Too often, especially with controversial authors, the most negative reviews come from people who haven&#8217;t even read the book in question. Their anger, and the resulting one-star review, is simply a statement of general antipathy towards the author and everything they do.I know of several authors who have had to ask Amazon to take down libelous one-star reviews that focus on their gender, their race, their political views and almost any other aspect of their character. While these might &#8211; might &#8211; be relevant factors in a general discussion about the author, they certainly have no place in a review of their work. And they certainly shouldn&#8217;t contribute to a headline star rating that helps readers decide whether a book is worth their money.The most frustrating thing is how easy this problem is to fix. Amazon needs to &#8211; immediately &#8211; change its review policy so that only people who have actually bought a book are allowed to review it. At a stroke, this would get rid of the complaints from people unable to buy a particular title on the Kindle, or unwilling to buy it in hardback &#8211; and it would also banish all of the general haters (who would never spend money on a book by the object of their hatred) as well as the kids and trolls who have never bought a book in their life.It&#8217;s hard, in fact, to think of a downside to restricting reviews to actual purchasers of a particular title. Sure it&#8217;s a restriction on the right of reviewers to express their opinion on a book or an author without first paying money, but so it should be. Amazon isn&#8217;t a general book review site, it&#8217;s a store &#8211; and as such its reader reviews exist to answer one question alone: is this book &#8211; in whatever format it happens to be published &#8211; worth my money?And that&#8217;s a question that should only be answered by real shoppers, not crazed Kindle fanboys or assorted haters with an axe to grind.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Watching live video on your iPhone is nothing new, but it is becoming increasingly easier to do.  More than a year after Ustream launched its live video viewing iPhone app, and followed up with a video publishing app, along with Qik and Kyte, Justin.tv is entering the mobile game with its first iPhone app (which should be available shortly in the iTunes store).Justin.tv CEO Michael Seibel says they took their time with the app because they wanted to get it right.  &#8220;We tried not to cut corners,&#8221; he says.  All the live videos and channels available on the Website can be watched in the iPhone app.  You can find videos by looking at the featured channels or by searching.  Videos play horizontally in landscape mode, and text chat is built into the app.  The chat text is laid across the bottom of the video and can be tapped on to make it disappear.  And the audio works both with or without headphones, which apparently isn&#8217;t the case with all other iPhone video apps.Video channels can be saved as favorites, and an upcoming update to the app will add push notifications to tell you whenever one of your favorite channels is on live.  Videos can be shared via email.Where the app falls short is that it is only for watching live videos, not streaming them from your iPhone&#8217;s video camera.  The issue is that the iPhone API still doesn&#8217;t allow apps to access the camera directly.  Instead, other &#8220;live streaming&#8221; video apps have to come up with workarounds, which often involve sending out a succession of camera screen captures at one to two frames per second.  Seibel hopes the next iPhone OS 4.0 will allow for direct camera access which would make video uploads from the iPhone much more efficient.  If the iPhone OS 4.0 API makes live video streaming more practical, Justin.tv will include it as a feature in its app, along with the regular Twitter and Facebook broadcasting options.  Check out the app and tell us in comments how it compares the other video livestreaming iPhone apps.  Was it worth the wait, or is Justin.tv late to the game?    CrunchBase Information',\n",

And yet, according to Google Trends, both &#8220;farmville.com the game,&#8221; and &#8220;www.farmville.com the game&#8221; are the number two and three hottest search items today, respectively. So what&#8217;s going on?Well, if you click through to the detail page for either of the two queries, the answer appears to reside there. First of all, there are a bunch of borderline spam sites suggesting the game launched today on the website Farmville.com.

Both of those queries appear in the &#8220;Related searches&#8221; area for both of those Farmville queries.

       "  'comments_content': 'Now that SXSW is fully over, it&#8217;s time to start going over some of the data from the so-called Location War between Foursquare and Gowalla. The truth is that both saw an amazing surge in usage, and at least according to data I saw from one source, the two were neck and neck midway through the event (in terms of usage). Today, I asked them both to share some of their own internal recent data, seeing as both SXSW happened â\\x80\\x94 and then both were featured in Apple&#8217;s App Store last week.GigaOm posted some numbers earlier today, including that during the five days of SXSW (Interactive), Foursquare signed up 75,000 new users, to push them over 600,000 total. We got some other numbers from both Foursquare and Gowalla, as well.Foursquare is closing in on 400,000 check-ins a day during peak times. Last weekend, they hit an all-time high of 382,000 check-ins in one day (network-wide). Compare this to last month when they saw a then-record 1 million check-ins a week.Gowalla saw 135,000 check-ins during SXSW â\\x80\\x94 just in and around downtown Austin, TX (where SXSW is held).Some 5,800 people checked-in with Gowalla during the conference, which is a strong percentage of the total estimated attendance of somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000.The Austin Convention Center, The Hilton, Stubb&#8217;s BBQ, and The Driskill (hotel), all saw over 1,000 check-ins on Gowalla during SXSW. 600 people checked-in at the controversial Ev Williams keynote.Foursquare has now signed up almost 120,000 in the past 10 days (this is up from their stated 100,000 in 10 days right before SXSW).The iPhone is still dominating total Foursquare check-ins with 66% network-wide. The App Store feature undoubtedly helped keep that number so high despite it being on all of the major mobile platforms now.BlackBerry Foursquare usage is surging following the launch of that app. Last month, right after it launched, BlackBerry contributed 11% of total Foursquare check-ins â\\x80\\x94 now that number is at 16%.Android Foursquare check-in numbers are slightly falling. Since the iPhone didn&#8217;t lose any check-in share, obviously someone had to, and that was Android. It went from 13% share last month, to 10% in the past 10 days.The mobile web is also taking a big hit with regard to Foursquare check-ins. It was at 7% a month ago, now it&#8217;s at 3% as people get used to the new mobile apps, undoubtedly.Since the launch of version 2.0 of its app with comments and pictures, Gowalla has seen some 40,000 photos uploaded.Â\\xa0The photo feature should be added to the webOS and Android clients in a week or so.Neither company had any specific data as to whether they&#8217;re seeing a surge after Apple featured their apps in the App Store because it&#8217;s too hard to tell seeing as there was already a surge post-SXSW, I&#8217;m told. The App Store placement, assuming Apple keeps it up for a while, should help both maintain the momentum they have after the event.[photo: flickr/zhengxu]CrunchBase Information',\n",

Today, Google has announced that it&#8217;s experimenting with making this a bit easier, by including hotel prices alongside their Google Maps listings.According to the post, the feature is only available to a small number of users, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you don&#8217;t see it. Â\\xa0It&#8217;s also only being tested with a small number of advertisers, so there&#8217;s probably a limited selection of hotels that have prices listed. Â\\xa0Prices simply appear next to each listing on the map â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0clicking the price reveals which travel site is offering it (the example lists prices from Priceline and Expedia). Â\\xa0Google notes that this doesn&#8217;t actually change the order of the hotels presented, it just augments the information shown about them.Assuming this test goes well, it&#8217;s not hard to envision more travel-related improvements that could be made for Maps, which could easily become a lead-gen goldmine. Â\\xa0Yes, there are plenty of other travel sites that do this, but most of us use Google Maps out of habit, so it&#8217;s nice to have.This isn&#8217;t the first time Google has made moves affecting the travel space.

       "  'comments_content': 'Design startup COLOURlovers.com, which is a creative community for color, has merged with ColorSchemer, a desktop color matching software. The Y Combinator-backed merged company, which is called CHROMAom, will launch in the next few months as the ultimate color authority, aiming to be the &#8220;Nielsen for all things color.&#8221;COLOURlovers officially completed the merger with ColorSchemer in November of 2009. Launched in 2006, COLOURlovers is a resource for people who use color and provides a place to compare and share  color palettes, submit news and comments, and read color related articles and interviews. The site is currently seeing one million unique visitors a month and their users have created 1 million color palettes.Since the merger, COLOURlovers has been steadily growing its offerings and even struck a partnership with Twitter. When you go to your Design Settings within Twitter, you&#8217;ll see a link to COLOURlovers&#8217; Themeleon, a tool that lets Twitter users create customized and sleek profile pages. In the past few months, Themeleon has been used to design and add color to over 500,000 Twitter profiles. COLOURlovers and ColorSchemer have also released a new web-based pattern design tool, called Seamless, which allows you to design seamless patterns. With COLOURlovers&#8217; editing tools you can resize, rotate and add shapes, lines and text to the canvas and it tiles automatically.  You can then save and use your pattern and template. Another new focus for the merged company is to partner with manufacturers to create products from the designs created on the site. You can create fabric, t-shirts, artwork, prints, and more from designs created on COLOURlovers. The startup&#8217;s co-founder Darius  Monsef, who was formerly a engineer and designer for Microsoft&#8217;s Photosynth, tells me that eventually they&#8217;d like to become the Etsy for color design, allowing anyone to create and then sell design-related products on the site. While CHROMAom hasn&#8217;t been launched yet, its safe to say that COLOURlovers is fast becoming the go to site for all things color. Monsef hopes that CHROMAom will eventually be the global color authority to track all realtime information and research on color. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last year, we reported on an experimental new YouTube project called RealTime. Â\\xa0The feature let you interact with your friends on YouTube, sharing videos and seeing what else they were watching using a slick toolbar that was integrated at the bottom of the screen.  Alas, it looks like YouTube wasn&#8217;t satisfied with its performance: less than a year later, YouTube has removed the RealTime feature entirely. The following message was posted this morning to YouTube&#8217;s bug report forum:We&#8217;ve seen some of you wondering what occurred to the Realtime Toolbar. The Realtime Toolbar was recently retired and is no longer an available feature on YouTube.We were excited to release and experiment with Realtime and it has inspired us for new features on YouTube in the future. We look forward to introducing many new features in the coming months and are sharing them with you all. Many thanks to those of you who used Realtime and for your feedback to us on this feature- your suggestions and input help the Team shape the site and determine what should be developed to further improve the YouTube community.~ Liz (on behalf of the YouTube Team).RealTime looked and behaved a bit like Facebook&#8217;s notification system and the Meebo Bar.  You could click on a menu item in the bottom right hand side of your screen to see what your friends were currently watching.  If a friend invited you to watch a video, a small notification window would pop up immediately.  This could have been a boon to discovery, as it made it very easy for friends to swap the cool videos they found on the site. Â\\xa0But YouTube never rolled it out widely â\\x80\\x94 you could only access it if you had an invitation.So why did YouTube get rid of the feature? Â\\xa0As it turns out, RealTime didn&#8217;t increase engagement and discovery as much as the other features that the site has been rolling out, like auto-sharing videos to Facebook and Twitter, and the improved YouTube friend finder.Thanks to Michel Wester for the tipCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Erply, a business software firm, has raised $2 million in funding from Redpoint and Index Ventures, along with Marten Mickos, Zack Urlocker (both formerly of MySQL), Kenny van Zant (SolarWinds), Aydin Senkut, David McClure and the Accelerator Group.The company, founded by Kristian Hiiemaa in Estonia, is a 2009 Seedcamp winner and is already profitable. Its client base is growing roughly 20% each month, according to Hiiemaa. They currently have 2,000 business customers and 8,000 users.Seedcamp is a UK based incubator program cofounded by Saul Klein. This is the first Seedcamp winner to get funded by Index Ventures, where Klein is a partner.&#8220;We think Erply can do for business software what Skype did for telecom,&#8221; Klein told us.Â\\xa0 Skype, like Erply, was developed in Estonia before being sold to eBay in 2005 with a $2.75 billion valuation. Klein is hoping that Erply follows a similarly disruptive path, by making traditionally expensive business applications more affordable for smaller companies.Erply specializes in business management software, helping companies deal with inventory control, bookkeeping, and other tasks, from their brick-and-mortar stores to online operations. While rivals like SAP, Microsoft and Oracle dominate the larger accounts, Erply focuses on small businesses&#8212; courting them with cheaper fees. Typically, a small business will fulfill their software needs with the larger providers or local developers, but Hiiemaa says more are defecting to Erply as the company finds success in its marketing efforts. The lionshare of the $2 million will be funneled towards marketing and expanding the company&#8217;s team in Eastern Europe.Â\\xa0 So far, the company counts 8,000 seats and 2,000 companies.Although Erply offers a mix of free and paid packages, many customers are opting for the paid packages (the average subscription fee is $74 a month) &#8212; the company boasts a 25% conversion rate from free to paid. Small start-ups are taking advantage of the free versions, but Hiiemaa says most companies are entering on the pay side.Sidenote: the company is also betting on the iPad&#8212; Erply is preparing to launch a new application for the device in the near term that will help with real time inventory management.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'And so it begins.This Saturday, March 27, is the deadline to get your iPad application submitted to the App Store if you hope to have it approved in time for the iPad launch on April 3. Last week, Apple began accepting submissions for the new area of the store, and it seems likely (and not surprising) that there&#8217;s a bit of a rush going on.A few developers we&#8217;ve talked to have noted that approval times for their apps have started to drag out a bit. So far, none of the developers are too concerned about this, as it has just been a matter of a few days longer than the usual wait period. But this could point to another clogging of the App Store approval process down the road.Last year, there were no shortage of developers complaining about approval wait times in the App Store. Apple noted at the time that the vast majority of apps were approved within a two week window, but for many developers, this was still too slow. So Apple did something about it. By the end of last year/beginning of this year, wait times in the App Store decreased dramatically. In fact, most developers seemed utterly shocked when recent apps were approved for the store within just a couple of days (and some even less time). It seems Apple both streamlined the approval process a bit, and likely made a lot more hires on the App Store reviewer front.But the situation remains a tricky one. The more popular the App Store gets, the more apps will get submitted. And the more apps that get submitted, the longer the approval process will take. Unless Apple is willing to perpetually hire new app reviewers, the situation simply isn&#8217;t tenable. In many ways, it&#8217;s a good problem to have, but it&#8217;s still a problem. And it won&#8217;t be solved unless the App Store growth slows down, Apple finds an even better way to streamline app reviews (perhaps a trusted app developer program), or they open up the App Store (which they show no signs of doing).For now, these delays are likely just a speed bump as reviewers focus on iPad apps to make sure a bunch are ready for the April 3 launch. But if the iPad takes off like Apple hopes it will, we could be looking at app approval wait times going through the roof again, as thousands rush to cash in on the phenomenon.[photo: Universal Studios]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There is one word used over and over again in India to describe JustDial: Addictive.Said one entrepreneur I spoke with, â\\x80\\x9cMy mom lives in a village. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know sheâ\\x80\\x99d heard of JustDial and recently she was telling me sheâ\\x80\\x99s addicted to it. She says before she can even think of what it is she wants to know, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve already picked up the phone and answered the question for her.â\\x80\\x9dThe idea is simple: You call up and within the first ring a real person picks up the phone, you ask them for any business listing &#8211; in any category &#8211; and within 45 seconds they email or text you the information or, if you prefer, connect the call. The company will end its fiscal year at the end of March with some $32 million in revenues having answered 72 million calls in the last year. That call volume is increasing by 40%, so the company expects to break 100 million calls in the next year. In a country where nearly everyone has a mobile phone but just 50 million people have Internet access, JustDial is essentially Google and 411 rolled together.But what will it be in the U.S.? Weâ\\x80\\x99ll find out today. After several months of tweaking the service and building out the database, JustDial is officially launching its free 411-like service here on the number 1-800-JUSTDIAL with a huge Facebook ad campaign starting momentarily. Sound way too low-tech for high-tech, always-on, smart-phone connected America? Well Sequoia Capital doesnâ\\x80\\x99t think so. Having already funded the company in India, Sequoia has taken an additional 15% stake in the US operation. Founder and CEO V.S.S. Mani (pictured above, in one of his call centers) was in Silicon Valley last December where Sequoia kingpin Mike Moritz himself blessed the deal after some initial reservations, Mani told me over dinner at a posh, beach-side restaurant in Mumbai last week. The Sand Hill Road pow-wow was quite a moment for him.The move is a direct volley at a service like GOOG-411, which has opted to do the same thing, but using voice recognition software. But Mani is betting that nothing beats a human voice with a quick answer.He started this company for the first time back in 1989, having just dropped out of school to become a CPA. It was way too ahead of its time, especially considering you had to apply for a phone line (and wait years to get it) in India and cell phones were non-existent. The company eventually folded. He started it again in 1996, having waited a year for an Indian landline, and hoping and praying he could land his first choice of number: 888-8888. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep for two days,â\\x80\\x9d Mani says. â\\x80\\x9cI knew if I got the number my future would be assured. I was waking up in the middle of the night to make sure the line was working.â\\x80\\x9d He got it, but because of the growth of phone lines in India since, there are now a few extra 8s on the end.The company makes money from small businesses paying up to be sponsored listings, when someone, say, calls for a plumber much like Google. JustDial has more than 100,000 of them and, similar to Google, they only pay when they get a lead from the service. The company has raised $46 million to date from Sequoia, Tiger Venture and SAIF, but Mani says itâ\\x80\\x99s all still in the bank. Heâ\\x80\\x99s grown the company to this size out of revenues and his initial $1,000 investment.For now, JustDialâ\\x80\\x99s US operations will be handled out of India, where the company employs some 4,000 people but, in a twist to the direction most call center jobs are flowing, Mani plans to hire up big in the USâ\\x80\\x94up to 1,000 people mostly in under-employed, rural areas.  â\\x80\\x9cWe need a big presence in the US very soon,â\\x80\\x9d Mani says. That right&#8211; an Indian company will be creating call center jobs in the US.This is more than just business expansion for Maniâ\\x80\\x94this is validation. Heâ\\x80\\x99s long thought the ultimate proof-point of JustDialâ\\x80\\x99s obsessively quick user experience would be success in the ultra-wired US market. Unlike in India, the US already has multiple ways to find business listings. JustDial is no longer in the business of low-hanging fruitâ\\x80\\x94with todayâ\\x80\\x99s move JustDial has to be more than the only option to win, it has to be the best.(Photo: Geoffrey Ellis)CrunchBase Information',\n",

A new report coming out later today from mobile app analytics company Flurry puts a number on the iPhone/iPod Touch videogame industry.  In 2009, Flurry estimates that $500 million worth of games were sold through the App Store in the U.S., up from $115 million in 2008.  Compared to the overall U.S. console and portable videogame market, the iPhone/iPod Touch now represents 5 percent of total videogame sales. (These figures include console games such as PlayStation and Xbox, but not online or social games).  Games represent 37 percent of Flurry&#8217;s total U.S. App Store 2009 revenue estimate of $1.36 billion.In just the portable videogame market, the numbers are even more stark.  The iPhone and iPod Touch are making serious inroads against the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS.  Games running on the iPhone OS went from 5 percent of portable game revenues in 2008 to 19 percent in 2009.  The iPhone OS took 9 points of software revenue market share away from the PSP last year (which went from 20 percent to 11 percent) and 5 points from Nintendo DS (75 percent to 70 percent).  It is eating up the portable games market.There are 30,000 games on the iPhone and growing.  If you are a gamer and already own an iPhone, you have to be pretty dedicated to also carry around a PSP, Nintendo DS, or some other single-purpose game machine.  When it comes to mobile gaming, fully-featured, general-purpose computer phones are hard to beat.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

Needless to say, they&#8217;re growing fast.To help with that growth, the location infrastructure company (which helps other companies easily implement location) Â\\xa0has added five new employees to their workforce. They are:Andrew Mager, a former Ning and CNET employee who will now be handling developer outreach.Schuyler Erle, a geographer well-known in GIS and open location data circles. He&#8217;ll be forming geography/cartography team with&#8230;Seth Fitzsimmons, a former Yahoo employee best known for his work on the location-based Fire Eagle, and more recently for Flickr&#8217;s location components.Ben Standefer, a former EventBrite and Digg employee . He&#8217;ll be working on SimpleGeo&#8217;s infrastructure, overseeing the data coming into the system.Kim Vogt, a former Lawrence Livermore Labs employee working on Hadoop. She&#8217;ll also be working on the data/infrastructure side of things, leading the effort with Standefer.The five new employee brings SimpleGeo&#8217;s total up to 13. In fact, they&#8217;re getting so big, that they&#8217;ve decided to open another office. They&#8217;re currently scouting locations (they should have some good data to do that) to open a new branch in San Francisco, to go along with their headquarters in Boulder, CO. Considering many of these new employees are SF-based (as is previous recent hire Mike Malone), and given how many location-centric events are happening around the city in the coming months, this makes sense.While SimpleGeo is currently still in closed beta testing, they plan to open to the public in the coming weeks, co-founder Matt Galligan tells us. Given the amount of interest surrounding location-based services right now, the timing seems perfect. Location was the talk of SXSW this year, and SimpleGeo had maybe the coolest way to visualize it, with Vicarious.ly, which showed various location data around Austin, TX (such as Foursquare and Gowalla check-ins) in realtime. The plan is to launch Vicarious.ly for other cities as well, to show off the data SimpleGeo is collecting. The service also announced a partnership with Skyhook Wireless to give them even more massive amounts of geodata.[interestingly enough, the picture of SimpleGeo co-founders Galligan and Joe Stump was taken a year ago by Andrew Mager -- it all comes around]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google has shut down it&#8217;s Chinese search site at Google.cn and is now redirecting visitors to Google.com.hk. This is in response to the widely reported cyber attack on Google in December, Google confirms.Users are being redirected for Google web, news and image search to the Hong Kong site, which sits outside of the Chinese firewall. Users are also being presented with simplified Chinese in addition to traditional Chinese and English results.Google&#8217;s music search and maps products will remain live, says the company. And Google will retain research and development and sales teams in China.Update: Google&#8217;s blog post on this:On January 12, we announced on this blog that Google and more than twenty other U.S. companies had been the victims of a sophisticated cyber attack originating from China, and that during our investigation into these attacks we had uncovered evidence to suggest that the Gmail accounts of dozens of human rights activists connected with China were being routinely accessed by third parties, most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on their computers. We also made clear that these attacks and the surveillance they uncoveredâ\\x80\\x94combined with attempts over the last year to further limit free speech on the web in China including the persistent blocking of websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google Docs and Bloggerâ\\x80\\x94had led us to conclude that we could no longer continue censoring our results on Google.cn. So earlier today we stopped censoring our search servicesâ\\x80\\x94Google Search, Google News, and Google Imagesâ\\x80\\x94on Google.cn. Users visiting Google.cn are now being redirected to Google.com.hk, where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong. Users in Hong Kong will continue to receive their existing uncensored, traditional Chinese service, also from Google.com.hk. Due to the increased load on our Hong Kong servers and the complicated nature of these changes, users may see some slowdown in service or find some products temporarily inaccessible as we switch everything over. Figuring out how to make good on our promise to stop censoring search on Google.cn has been hard. We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement. We believe this new approach of providing uncensored search in simplified Chinese from Google.com.hk is a sensible solution to the challenges we&#8217;ve facedâ\\x80\\x94it&#8217;s entirely legal and will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China. We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision, though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services. We will therefore be carefully monitoring access issues, and have created this new web page, which we will update regularly each day, so that everyone can see which Google services are available in China. In terms of Google&#8217;s wider business operations, we intend to continue R&amp;D work in China and also to maintain a sales presence there, though the size of the sales team will obviously be partially dependent on the ability of mainland Chinese users to access Google.com.hk. Finally, we would like to make clear that all these decisions have been driven and implemented by our executives in the United States, and that none of our employees in China can, or should, be held responsible for them. Despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in January, they have continued to focus on serving our Chinese users and customers. We are immensely proud of them.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Socialwok, a product that ads a social layer to Gmail and other Google products, was just integrated as a partner in Google&#8217;s recently launched Google Apps Marketplace. At last year&#8217;s TechCrunch50 conference, Socialwok made a big splash, winning the award for best demopit startup and launching its enterprise-friendly, FriendFeed-like layer for Google Apps. The web-based application was praised for launching a social network that wrapped around the very unsocial Google Apps. And the startup just launched a gadget to allow users access all the features of Socialwok without leaving Gmail. Today, Socialwok is becoming more than just a collaboration platform; the startup is integrating with Facebook, Twitter, Google Buzz, and RSS feeds to allow users to tap into their outside social networks within Socialwok. Socialwok is now a full-fledged Twitter client and allows users to Tweet directly from its platform, as well as track a brand or keywords on Twitter from within the application. Additionally, users can monitor and track updates on a Facebook page. Socialwok is also allowing users to import RSS feeds and share it within a company&#8217;s Socialwok account. And Socialwok is integrated with Google Buzz, and allows users to tap into their Buzz streams from within the platform and share content in Buzz from within Socialwok. With the addition of social networking functionality, Socialwok is becoming more than just a collaboration platform. In fact, the application is developing into a full-fledged social CRM, taking on Salesforce&#8217;s Chatter, Jive, Socialcast and a host of other enterprise friendly social networks. CEO Ming Yong tells me that after the startup&#8217;s launch on the Google Apps marketplace last week, Socialwok signed up over 4000 businesses to its service. Prior to the launch on the marketplace, 6,000 domains and tens of thousands of users were using Socialwok. Socialwok, which employs a freemium model, has steadily been adding features and improvements to its application, including releasing a new version of its HTML 5 mobile version for Android and iPhone browsers. And in the process of developing an innovative application, startup managed to catch Google&#8217;s eye. In addition to joining as a pilot partner on the Google App Marketplace, Socialwok was  chosen as one of the showcase companies for AppEngine technology at this year&#8217;s Google IO Developer Sandbox (Socialwok is powered by Google App Engine). And the startup wrote a blog post on Google&#8217;s Enterprise Blog about Socialwok. We&#8217;ve continuously written that if Google doesnâ\\x80\\x99t buy the startup, they should at least heavily promoting what theyâ\\x80\\x99re doing. And it appears that Google has taken the latter route. For now. There&#8217;s no doubt that Socialwok could face the same fate as Google Docs killer and collaboration platform Etherpad or Microsoft Word collaboration plug-in Docverse.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'VentureBeat&#8217;s Spring 2010 DEMO conference is kicking off this week. Out of the 65 companies that are launching products and services this week, there are a number of mobile-related startups in the mix. Interestingly, there are several startups that are launching simple iPhone and mobile app creation services. Among the more compelling ideas are Flinc&#8217;s realtime ridesharing app and Zerista&#8217;s Ning-like platform for mobile apps. Here&#8217;s a roundup of 8 startups with mobile applications and services launching at DEMO.Visiarc: Visiarc has developed a technology that helps bring the experience of viewing documents on a desktop to a mobile phone. The startup&#8217;s software aims to revolutionize the large email attachments on mobile phones, by streaming large attachments to your phone. AppWhirl: AppWhirl, which allows anyone to create personalized iPhone apps, is launching a new, simple app creation technology that allows users to create apps with a stream of realtime news and updates. The customized apps can aggregate a Twitter stream, a YouTube Channel, a Flickr image stream, Facebook status updates and more. Mmatcher: Mmatcher aims to bring location-aware, classified ads to mobile phones. A mobile ad network for classified ads, Mmatcher aims to bring buyers and sellers together and promises spam-free, realtime and personal matched classified ads to be delivered to mobile phones. The startup matches buyers and sellers using location as a key factor.Zerista: Zerista, which is like a Ning for mobile apps, helps create mobile apps for small, social communities. Zerista will turn a group, club, team or organization into a mobile community by letting users create a simple mobile application a group can use from a smartphone or computer. The apps allow for a centralized location for group activities and schedules, and even incorporates social media and check-in technologies.AppVoyage: AppVoyage&#8217;s software helps developers publish apps to multiple app stores, and helps build mobile advertising campaigns. AppVoyage is rolling out AppBox, which uses a self-service, simple drag and drop technology to build mobile apps and advertising campaigns. Flinc: Flinc is launching a mobile application that allows people to match up with each other for rides based on their location. Called dynamic ridesharing, the applications will keep track of traffic in real time, will connect users with open seats in cars within their network, let them send requests to be picked up, and coordinates messaging between drivers and pick-ups. Phone Halo: Phone Halo wants to prevent the annoying and sometimes costly problem of losing and misplacing your phone, keys, wallet, and other valuables. Phone Halo attaches a small Bluetooth device to keys, purse, or other valuable with a software running on the phone to track the distance between the phone and device.  When the two become separated, both ring and alert you. The app is only available for Android and Blackberry devices for now. Zosh: Zosh aims to eliminate the need for fax machines. An iPhone app allows you to take documents and sign them or write on them via your iPhone. You can then email the signed documents to anyone.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'SugarSync, a file syncing product that we may have all forgotten in our rush to glorify Dropbox has been rolling out a steady stream of improvements and, as of 11am today, it will offer an API so mobile applications can use SugarSync shared storage. The API information will live at SugarSync.com/Developers when it goes up today.The API essentially creates a &#8220;bridge between local devices and the cloud.&#8221; In plain English, this would allow a developer to offload storage to a SugarSync server &#8211; think a photo application that can upload and display public links immediately or, barring that, a sort of shared workspace that would allow disparate programs to work on the same files in locked down OSes like iPhone OS and Windows Phone 7. The apps don&#8217;t have to be mobile &#8211; it works in web and desktop contexts as well &#8211; and access to the API is free.Developers can also make money by getting a cut of new subscribers who sign up for the service. SugarSync is also running a contest for new apps. You can check it out at the dev website. There are also a few caveats:Can we leverage free SugarSync accounts?Yes! While our free accounts donâ\\x80\\x99t have all of the functionality of our premium version, there are still many things you can do with your app and a free SugarSync account. Your app may create maximum of one free account per user, and it cannot bridge or connect two separate accounts. Initially, you will have access to 5000 free accounts. If you run out or believe your audience will tap those out quickly, please contact us and weâ\\x80\\x99re happy to work with you.Man, if you can sell 5000 apps and convince people to use them properly, I&#8217;m happy to work with you.Unlike many services that &#8220;get an API,&#8221; SugarSync seems to know what they&#8217;re doing. There is a need for open, potentially free space in the cloud and because they offer a concrete &#8220;service&#8221; instead of a nebulous spurt of API hand-waving, I say good on them.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Good news, Android users: Dropbox, the widely acclaimed (and super-useful) file syncing service, is going to be releasing an application for Android devices very soon.  Today, they&#8217;re giving us a taste of what to expect when the app lands some time in the next couple months, and it looks like it will be worth the wait.The new Android App will allow users to view their files from their phones, and will support multimedia content like music and movies (you can elect to store your key documents locally on your phone if you want).  As with the desktop version of the app, if you edit a file, it will automatically sync up with your account.  You can upload new files to your account and share links to them with your friends (the app will also be integrated into Android&#8217;s systemwide &#8216;Share Via&#8217; menu, so you can immediately upload a photo or video you shoot to Dropbox).  In short, this is exactly what Android-toting Dropbox users have been waiting for.Dropbox has been available on the desktop and web since it launched at TechCrunch50 2008, and it released an iPhone application in September 2009.  Other smartphone users have been able to access their accounts through a mobile web app, but it doesn&#8217;t offer nearly the flexibility that the native app will. Â\\xa0According to an email the company sent out last month, a native BlackBerry app is on the way as well.For those of you that haven&#8217;t tried Dropbox, it&#8217;s a service that makes it remarkably easy to share files between multiple computers (it means you don&#8217;t have to keep emailing files between your home and work computers, or rely on a clunky USB stick).

The idea was to get the most qualified applicants who were more really serious about the job.  The founders of localbacon took what they learned from operating their site and are now relaunching with a much better idea centered more around social recruiting.  In many ways, Jibe is using Facebook Connect to create a LinkedIn for the Facebook set.  The new site is called Jibe, and it ties into Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to help people find jobs through their social networks.  Jibe is open today in private beta.  The first 200 people to enter the code &#8220;Techcrunch&#8221; will receive an invite.  Jibe also relocated to Dogpatch Labs in New York City, and closed an $875,000 seed round led by Polaris Venture Partners (which runs Dogpatch Labs).  Other investors include Lerer Media Ventures, Zelkova Ventures, Jason Calacanis (who is our partner in TechCrunch50), and Josh and Jared Kushner. On Jibe, job seekers sign in with Facebook Connect. It pulls in their work and education history from their Facebook profile to pre-populate their Jibe profile.  They can link their account to LinkedIn and Twitter as well (the service is targeting the 24-and-under crowd, who tend not to have LinkedIn accounts).  Then for every job posting, they can see if they are connected to anyone at that company.  Jibe allows members to message those people directly to ask for a recommendation or job advice.  Jibe still charges applicants to apply for jobs, but is now using a credit system.  Applicants earn credits by linking their Jibe account to their various social networks, broadcasting their job search, sending private messages through the system, or updating their work history profile.  They can also buy 500 credits for $5.Each job listing is ranked based on how many times it&#8217;s been viewed, saved, or applied for.  The jobs that rank higher turn up at the top of job searches.  Employers can post jobs for free, but pay $15 to unlock an applicant&#8217;s profile.  By unlocking the profile employers get to see the applicant&#8217;s name, who else they are connected to in the company, and they can send them a direct message.  Candidates whose profile gets unlocked the most appear on a leaderboardJibe turns Facebook&#8217;s social graph into an internal recruiting graph for each candidate, showing the HR person or hiring manager who else in the company is connected to the candidate.  Anyone who refers more than 10 friends for jobs will get their profile highlighted to their employer.  Companies can also turn fans on their Facebook page into &#8220;job ambassadors.&#8221; A corresponding Facebook app will allow employers to put their job listings in their fan pages, where people can apply directly.  Jibe is also making this recruiting graph available to college career centers in the hopes that they will use it as a tool to help students apply for jobs.  The current job boards are broken and dying.  Injecting social elements into the job search makes much more sense.  The best jobs always come through people you know.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Social mobile location startup Rummble has added the ability for members to &#8216;check-in&#8217; and recommend places via Twitter, rather than having to use the company&#8217;s Android or iPhone app or browser-based version.It does this through a bit of nifty but fairly crude sentiment analysis, turning any tweet with the hashtag #rummble into something the service will understand. So, for example &#8220;Hanging out in Joes Cafe, 9th Ave, NYC. Great coffee and free wifi. 7/10 #rummble&#8221; would be interpreted as a check-in to Joes Cafe, giving it a Rummble of 7/10 noting the &#8220;great coffee and free wifi&#8221;Obviously, the more information you can cram into 140 characters using trigger words such as &#8220;hanging out&#8221; or &#8220;just arrived&#8221;, along with the bare facts, the more accurate Rummble&#8217;s sentiment analysis will be. And, as noted, you&#8217;ll need to remember to include that #rummble hash tag.It&#8217;s been a busy time for the startup. At last week&#8217;s South by Southwest Interactive, the company unveiled an improved Rummble friends list for their iPhone and Android apps which lets users see not only the updates of their Rummble friends but also people theyâ\\x80\\x99re following on Twitter and other location-based services such as Brightkite, Gowalla and Foursquare. But if location-based services like Rummble are to become more useful and embedded into our daily lives, they&#8217;ll arguably need to become more passive, needing less and less intervention on the user&#8217;s part. I&#8217;m not sure that turning or rather interpreting a tweet as a piece of location-based data or &#8216;action&#8217; should require the use of a specific hash tag at all. Would it not make more sense to give users the option, once they&#8217;ve chosen to link their Twitter and Rummble accounts, to let the service interpret any tweet as a potential &#8216;check-in&#8217; and review?Although, maybe it&#8217;s here where the non-trivial nature of 140-character driven sentiment analysis needs a helping hand. &#8220;Computers reading natural language is always tricky; computers reading 140 characters is even trickier&#8221;, says Rummble on the company&#8217;s blog.And on the newly introduced Foursquare and Gowalla integration, Rummble says:&#8220;Living in a world with many different social location-based services to choose from should make it easier to know where all of your friends are located, but people often miss out on the action because there are a number of places to check out friendâ\\x80\\x99s check-ins and location chatter. Rummbleâ\\x80\\x99s answer to this problem is to tell you where your friends are located, regardless of where that information was created.&#8221;That makes a lot of sense to us.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Startups in the UK and wider Europe have been having a hard time attracting early funding in the current economic climate so the news is pretty welcome.In fact it appears that Atomico itself has been affected by the downturn, having originally hoped to have raised the higher figure of $266m, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year.â\\x80\\x9cThe type of companies we are looking at are consumer-facing and also small businessâ\\x80\\x89.â\\x80\\x89.â\\x80\\x89.â\\x80\\x89that do not need to build up sales forces around the world to scale and grow,â\\x80\\x9d said ZennstrÃ¶m. â\\x80\\x9cThese are the kinds of companies like Skype, Google and Facebook who, if the business model is really working, they can get large revenues without having to go through too many financing rounds.â\\x80\\x9d The appearance of the Atomico on the scene now takes these &#8217;super angel&#8217; funds, something we wrote about on TC Europe two years ago, to a much more significant level.

       "  'comments_content': 'When betaworks launched chartbeat nearly a year ago, the idea was to create a realtime Google Analytics for Websites.  Chartbeat is a dashboard which shows you how many people are on your site right now, where they are coming from, and how engaged they are.  Watching realtime stats is even more addictive than Google Analytics because you can put something up on your Website and immediately see the reaction.Today, Chartbeat is releasing an entirely new version in beta.  The bland design of the old dashboard is being replaced with much more colorful, easy-to-read charts and graphs which pulsate as the activity on your Website changes.  (You can see the new and old versions in the two screenshots at the bottom of this post).  Up in the top left is a speed dial showing how many people are on your site this minute, broken down by new and returning visitors.  Below that are some engagement dials, which indicate how many visitors are reading, writing comments, or sitting idle on the page.  Other widgets show load times, the most popular pages, sources of traffic, geographic distribution of visitors, and Twitter conversations.  Along the right side you get a snapshot of where different individual visitors are coming from and what pages they are landing on in a continuously updating stream.Much of this data was available before, but the new version does a much better job of presenting it in a readable manner.  The biggest change, however, is that each analytics box on the main page can be clicked on for a deeper view of that particular data (by page, traffic source, engagement, and so on).  And as with the original version, chartbeat allows you to replay the past day, week, or month to show you how traffic patterns change on your site.  The top stories pulsate green or red, depending on whether they are gaining more readers or losing them.  It literally lets you replay and watch the activity on your site.For news sites or blogs, chartbeat is especially appealing because it lets you see which stories are hot right now.  If you are not already featuring a story that is trending, chartbeat provides the data to help you put it in front of more readers before its too late to do anything about it.  Chartbeat offers a free 30-day trial, and costs $10 a month after that. Below is a video, showing the new look and features:    CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There&#8217;s no doubt about it: the iPad is the elephant in the ereader room but there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m certain: it won&#8217;t kill off the ebook readers. Amazon just took another length in the Kindle&#8217;s already strong position on the ereader battlefield with the announcement of Kindle Apps for Tablet Computers.This app picks up where the standard desktop Kindle program drops off. Just like nearly every other desktop application, the original PC and Mac Kindle app isn&#8217;t optimized for finger navigation with small buttons and drop down menus. Plus, it&#8217;s not pretty and almost utilitarian in design. The upcoming tablet program, however, takes styling cues from Apple&#8217;s iBooks and looks finger friendly enough.This is huge. No longer can the iPad claim dominance on the color ebook world. The upcoming Kindle tablet program will be able to run on presumably any PC tablet and still sync to the other Kindle apps, mobile or otherwise. Knock &#8220;color ebook reader&#8221; off of the iPad&#8217;s list of Pros. The tablet race just got a bit more interesting.Content is king in the world of ebook readers and Apple should know that more than any company. The App Store, with its tens of thousands of apps, is one of the main reasons the iPad is guaranteed to be a success. It&#8217;s not a big leap for millions of iPhone and iPod touch owners because they already knew what to expect as they&#8217;ve been using the App Store for a while on another device.The same thinking will drive the Kindle Apps for Tablet Computers program. Consumers have been buying books from the Kindle Store since its launch in 2007 and Amazon keeps making those books more accessible by releasing Kindle apps for different platforms. Consumers own this content and expect to be able to access it no matter what device they are using because of Amazon&#8217;s precedent. Now they can read their books not only on the Kindle itself, but also a BlackBerry, iPhone, PC, Mac, and soon nearly any tablet PC.It seems that the tablet PC program throws in some new tricks. There&#8217;s a lifelike page turn animation, a colorful ebook library, and numerous font size and color options. This might even show what a color Kindle would look like.This upcoming Kindle app isn&#8217;t just for PCs. The title graphic clearly states Kindle Apps for Tablet Computers including the iPad. But don&#8217;t get too excited. This doesn&#8217;t mean that it will ever hit the iPad. Technically it&#8217;s up to Apple whether this app will run on the iPad and Apple&#8217;s track record doesn&#8217;t make its future look all that promising.iBooks is a key feature to the iPad just like Safari and iTunes are to the iPhone/iPod. Apple has yet to approve Opera or Firefox Mobile and could stall the Kindle iPad app indefinitely on the same grounds as well. After all, a Kindle app with access to the Kindle Store would take away from Apples own content partnerships. Apple you know likes to eat its own dog food.Most Kindle buyers are also the same sort of early adapters Apple is counting on to make the iPad a success, too. It&#8217;s would be a dangerous game to cut out Kindle power users and drive them to the competing PC platforms. This upcoming Kindle app could prove to be one of the key pillars the PC tablet movement needs to boost consumers confidence. It will allow nearly any tablet PC to become its own Kindle &#8212; or iPad &#8212; clone.',\n",

Following the launch of the Pre and Pixi on Sprint last year and their respective Plus editions on Verizon back in January, Palm has just announced that they&#8217;ll soon be launching the Pre Plus and Pixi Plus on AT&#038;T.While its never bad news to get your handsets onto a new carrier, just how good this news is for Palm depends almost entirely on how AT&#038;T handles it.Palm&#8217;s exclusive launch with Sprint came as the carrier was smack-dab in the middle of their never-ending customer bleed, and their debut on Verizon had the unfortunate timing of coming right after VZW had just dumped a monstrous marketing budget into the Motorola Droid. With AT&#038;T expected to only have an exclusive lock on the contract-magnet wunderkind that is the iPhone for another year (and a half, at most), how much time will they put behind properly marketing Palm&#8217;s goods?From a hardware standpoint, the handsets being offered up for AT&#038;T are virtually identical to that which we saw hit Verizon, save the fact that these latest ones are GSM. The Pre Plus has a 3.1&#8243; screen, while the Pixi Plus&#8217; comes in at 2.63&#8243;. Both handsets have 802.11b/g WiFi, integrated GPS, and Bluetooth 2.1+.The software has seen some minor changes. The on-the-fly WiFi router Mobile Hotspot software that debuted on the VZW handsets didn&#8217;t make it over. On the upside, Palm threw in a new feature they&#8217;re calling &#8220;Whisper&#8221;, which automatically connects AT&#038;T Hotspot customers to any AT&#038;T WiFi point without requiring them to retype their credentials.Neither company is saying exactly when to expect the handsets to hit the shelves, outside of &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221; When they do, the price tag will be set at $149.99 for the Pre Plus and $49.99 for the Pixi Plus, both after an always-annoying $100 mail-in rebate.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The British Government, faced with an upcoming general election in which policy toward the internet, digital inclusion of the masses and how government IT interfaces with the private sector will all come into play, has rolled out the big guns in the shape of the Prime Minister and a clutch of ministers and advisers today. In a speech in London, billed as &#8220;Building Britain&#8217;s Digital Future&#8221;, Gordon Brown ranged over a wide range of topics and mentioned all the buzz phrases his policy advisors could cram into one speech including the &#8220;semantic web&#8221; and the &#8220;web of linked data&#8221;. There were the obligatory mentions of YouTube and Twitter of course.Here are the highlights:â\\x80¢ What&#8217;s the opportunity for entrepreneurs? Access to greater government data for new services. There will be a new wave of public/private back office companies linked by this data, said Brown.â\\x80¢ Brown promised what he called &#8220;super fast broadband&#8221; for 100% of the country by 2020 (there&#8217;s some suggestion that this amounts to 1MB which cant be right, surely&#8230;?).  However it&#8217;s worth noting that in their &#8220;technology manifesto&#8221;, the Tories have pledged similar move and also to publish large amounts of government data and contracts. It&#8217;s hard to see the difference here.â\\x80¢ Digital Minister Stephen Timms promised a new replacement clause during the Commons stage of the Digital Economy Bill in response to the wave of opposition about Clause 18 which leads to disconnection after accusation currently. He added that there will be a right of appeal on disconnection and hopes &#8220;technical measures &#8221; won&#8217;t be needed. Thumbscrews maybe?â\\x80¢ There will be a Â£30m fund to create the Institute of Web Science headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Prof. Nigel Shadwell. The former was not present but latter said the Institute would bring together different disciplines to study the web, not just technology but legal and economic aspects. It will create a &#8220;modern Domesday book for the 21st century&#8221; said Brown &#8211; in other words a list of all the data held by government which can be released. We&#8217;re wondering if the US has anything like this? â\\x80¢ &#8220;MyGov&#8221; will be a personalised portal for people to access government services like pensions/tax benefits, doctors appointment, talking to teachers or getting a new passport or driving license. There were no details about how authorisation and ID takes place as yet and a question from the audience about whether it would be based on ID cards didn&#8217;t get a full answer other than that authorisation would be similar to how people already buy things online with their credit card.â\\x80¢ Advisor on the UK&#8217;s Digital Inclusion push Martha Lane Fox has a new job &#8211; leading a digital public services unit. Here&#8217;s the press-friendly catchphrase from the PM: &#8220;The digital net will be the new public safety net&#8221;.â\\x80¢ Of course much of this is about saving money in hard times. Brown quoted PwC estimates which say government can save Â£900m by getting more people to use public services online. There would be some Â£11bn of savings to the public finances through using the web, which is part of Â£20bn of savings in the government budget, said Brown. QED.â\\x80¢ There will be an new iPhone app released to allow people to interact with Number 10 and get information on government news. It&#8217;s not to be confused with an unofficial iPhone app that costs Â£1.19. The free/official app will be coming soon.â\\x80¢ They predict Â£4bn in backoffice savings by using new web technologiesâ\\x80¢ Their new approach will mean a  less centralised approach to government because obviously civil servants suddenly don&#8217;t have all be in London. â\\x80¢ The PM made the point that &#8220;Do you need more independent whitehall departments when you can have a web platform which cuts across boundaries&#8221;â\\x80¢ There wil be a 20% reduction in senior civil service paybill as a result of these moves â\\x80¢ There were a few platitudes about giving the public greater influence over policy making using the Web. Point in case, there have been 70,000 petitions on the Number 10 site since 2006 and the Gov has replied to 8m people.â\\x80¢ Loads of Twitter, Flickr, Youtube stats (numbers of tweets and videos watched). â\\x80¢ Brown said: &#8220;I predict education will be our biggest export 10 years from now.&#8221;Reactions so far:â\\x80¢ Executive director Jim Killock told the BBC: &#8220;Online government is a great idea, but Labour cannot say people will depend on online government, and simultaneously plan to disconnect families after allegations of minor copyright offenses.&#8221;â\\x80¢ RT @Documentally: Brown promises super fast broadband by 2020!!

ChaCha thinks celebrities and businesses will feel safe using ChaCha.me because they only have to answer the questions they like and they can stay in control of the discussion.And ChaCha users will be able to integrate the Q&amp;A feature directly into their Facebook pages as well.

       "  'comments_content': 'For the future of innovation in the United States, few things seem as important as access to broadband Internet connections. The FCC seems to realize this, which is why they&#8217;ve set up the National Broadband Plan. And yet, we&#8217;re screwed.As Harvard Law professor Yochai Benkler lays out in an excellent op-ed today in the New York Times, this new broadband plan may sound great, but it won&#8217;t go nearly far enough. The reason is that there is simply nowhere near enough competition in almost all of the markets in this country. In fact, under the new plan, some 85% of homes covered would have no choice when it comes to a provider. So while it&#8217;s great that just about everyone will potentially have broadband access in 2020, plenty likely won&#8217;t be able to afford it.And even those lucky enough to have a choice, are probably only going to be able to choose between two options â\\x80\\x94 and again, both of those are likely to be very expensive. The U.S. has the highest broadband prices among advanced nations, while countries like Japan and France get faster (and better) services, for a fraction of the price many of us pay. Again, it&#8217;s all about competition. So why do we put up with it? Because the U.S. government has no backbone and ruins its own ideas (such as the National Broadband Plan) because they give into corporate lobbyists.As Benkler points out in his piece, Time Warner is quite pleased that it can set higher prices due to a lack of competition. Meanwhile, Comcast is raking in just about a billion dollars in profit each quarter thanks in large part to their pricing bullshit.Is it expensive to lay down the necessary fiber for these super-fast networks? Of course. But there are plenty of ways that competitors could help the big players offset those costs if the government would simply make them open the pipes. But the big players don&#8217;t want that â\\x80\\x94 they&#8217;re perfectly happy to pay the large upfront costs to ensure that they can reap the much larger rewards on the other end thanks to this lack of competition.We may have but one hope.While plenty are wary of how big Google is becoming, the Internet giant has so-far proved to be on the right side with regard to universal Internet access. They were instrumental in making sure the wireless spectrum would be (at least somewhat) open, and now they&#8217;re pushing the wired broadband movement in the right direction too with their insanely fast fiber push. While the FCC&#8217;s 100 Squared plan would put 100 megabit-per-second broadband in people&#8217;s homes by 2020, Google wants to put 1 gigabit-per-second connections in people&#8217;s homes much sooner.Yes, Google is talking on a much smaller scale (500,000 homes vs. 100 million), but, if the initial response is any indication, Google may become a much, much bigger player in this space than they envision right now.We&#8217;ve written a couple of stories about cities doing some wacky things to get Google&#8217;s attention so that they might bring the broadband to their cities (here&#8217;s Topeka, Kansas and Baltimore, Maryland, for example). But there are dozensÂ\\xa0of other cities also foaming at the mouth for access. Some examples:Longview, Texas has a Twitter account devoted to it and a websiteBoth are true for Jersey City, NJ as wellSan Mateo, CA is issuing press releases to the media about its excitement and is getting TechCrunch 50 Red Beacon to lobby on its behalfFresno, CA has a Facebook fan page for fiber with about 7,500 fans so farGrand Rapids, MI has a website, Facebook fan page (with over 33,000 fans), and Twitter accountAnd yesterday, Greenville, SC had thousands of citizens line up to create a huge Google logoThose are just a few of the ones we&#8217;ve been tipped about. The reaction around the country to Google&#8217;s idea should make it very clear that the people of this country are demanding better access. And yet, the government won&#8217;t take the necessary steps to open the market up, and let it bloom because the lobbyists from the companies that stand to lose the most are actually the ones in control. If Google, one of the largest companies in this country, only believes they can afford to hook up 50,000 to 500,000 homes with their plan, how is any other company expected to compete with the incumbent players?They won&#8217;t. Not unless the government grows some balls and backs real openness.[photo: 20th Century Fox]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Virtual currency platform gWallet is announcing a partnership with online privacy certification company TRUSTe to reinforce gWallet ethical guidelines in the virtual currency space. gWallet partners with both brands and game developers to bring users virtual currency offers on games within social networks. Following the Scamville controversy in the virtual offers space, the startups which provide these offers on games have been working to rid their platforms of misleading offers.  In fact, Offerpal CEO George Garrick promised to take a leadership position in cleaning up scammy ads. Competitor Gwallet has also promised to never offer these type of ads, and is now partnering with TRUSTe to certify gWallet&#8217;s privacy practices. TRUSTe will also monitor offers submitted by gWalletâ\\x80\\x98s advertisers to ensure they aren&#8217;t misleading. For example, previously fake quizzes would be tied to long term mobile subscriptions, malware-laden toolbar downloads and and other scams. And Gwallet is betting on TRUSTe to keep these offers at bay. gWallet, which recently raised $10 million in funding, was founded by serial entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal. gWallet works directly with brands directly as opposed to adopting an affiliate leads model and uses branded video campaigns to engage with consumers. Disney, Best Buy, K-Mart, Nestle, Coke, and The History Channel are all using gWalletâ\\x80\\x99s video campaigns on social networks, which are powered by Tube Mogul. gWallet also announced an early-stage venture fund to invest in social gaming companies and promote innovation within the social gaming ecosystem. gWallet faces competition from Offerpal and SuperRewards.

       "  'comments_content': 'Some weeks, writing this column is easy. All it takes is for an influential person &#8211; a politician, a business person, perhaps even a fellow columnist &#8211; to say something dumb and I get to spend a thousand words or so explainingÂ\\xa0precisely why they&#8217;re wrong. The &#8220;why x is wrong about y&#8221; construction is the columnist&#8217;s best friend: it&#8217;s as old as the hills and even easier to build a house on.Some weeks though, it&#8217;s even easier than that. Someone will say something so breathtakingly wrong &#8211; so tracheotomy-cravingly moronic &#8211; that I don&#8217;t need to explain anything. Simply quoting their words back at them is sufficient to make the point.Step forward, Jimmy Wales.Speaking this week at the Guardian&#8217;s Guardian Changing Media Summit, Wales &#8211; the founder of Wikipedia &#8211; uttered the following statement when asked about the future of newspapers&#8230;&#8220;I donâ\\x80\\x99t see the added value   [of opinion columnists] and question whether a newspaper should be paying large sums of money for them anymore&#8230; The best of the political bloggers are easily the equal of the opinion columnists at the New York Times.&#8221;Those words could stand alone as a monument to Wales&#8217; wrongness &#8211; a warning for future generations on why we must never heed the advice of a man who calls himself &#8216;Jimbo&#8217;. But the very fact that Wales was invited to opine about the future of news at a major conference despite having no identifiable qualifications to do so compels me to elaborate. If people take his opinion on newspapers seriously enough to ask him to speak on the subject then there&#8217;s a terrifying possibility that they&#8217;ll take him seriously enough to act on his advice.And who could blame them? Newspaper owners are terrified &#8211; destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked &#8211; and desperately seeking any advice on how to cauterize their bottom line. The cause of their madness is, of course, the Internet and so it&#8217;s logical &#8211; after a fashion &#8211; that they should turn to Wales for answers. After all, he&#8217;s The Man From The Internet: surely he has all the answers?Yeeeeah. Not so much.For the benefit of those poor befuddled newspapermen, let&#8217;s take a few minutes &#8211; and a thousand words or so &#8211; to break down all the reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t listen to Jimmy Wales when he tells you how to run a newspaper.For a start, let&#8217;s consider what Wales actually does for a living. Or rather what he doesn&#8217;t do. He doesn&#8217;t own, operate or edit a newspaper. He doesn&#8217;t employ any journalists, has never sold an advertisement and he doesn&#8217;t have a single customer who pays to read the content he relies on volunteers to produce. For those reasons, his lack of understanding of the &#8220;added value&#8221; that high profile personalities bring to newspapers is understandable &#8211; forgivable even. Or at least it would be were it not for the fact that Wikipedia uses Wales&#8217; own high profile personality to encourage its users to donate money in order to ensure its survival.&#8220;A message from Jimmy Wales&#8221; reads the banner at the top of Wikipedia entries during the site&#8217;s regular donation drives. These banners link to a personal appeal for support, written by Jimbo and complete with an above-the-fold photo of his face. Jimmy Wales is the first encyclopedia editor since Alain T. Britannica to build a cult of personality around the gig. Why? Because he knows that personality creates familiarity, which in turn creates loyalty, which in turn creates value. Except, apparently, when it comes to newspapers.Which takes us to the real nub of Jimmy Wales&#8217; wrongness. No one would argue that the newspaper industry &#8211; in print form &#8211; is screwed. Speaking at the same Guardian conference, media commentator and Murdoch fanboy Michael Wolff summed the situation up nicely when he said â\\x80\\x9cEvery big-city newspaper in the U.S. is either in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy in the foreseeable future &#8211; thatâ\\x80\\x99s 12 months. The newspaper industry in the U.S. is over&#8221;.The future of news is online, but that future brings with it the total commoditisation of facts and the death of straight reporting as a way to drive reader loyalty. Newspapers aren&#8217;t just competing with other newspapers, but also with Twitter and Facebook and blogs and thousands of other channels through which facts can be disseminated.  If one paper puts its news behind a pay wall, the chances are that same news will be available elsewhere for free. Even with high quality investigative reporting, if the story is big enough then someone will simply rewrite it &#8211; perfectly legally &#8211; and post it on a blog, where it will then be reblogged and retweeted and aggregated. (The aggregators themselves encourage this: Gabe Rivera told me recently that the best way for a blogger to get content on Techmeme is to paraphrase something that previously appeared behind a pay-wall).The battle to force people to pay for general news, then, is lost. Likewise, thanks to micro-aggregators like Techmeme and macro-aggregators like Google News, the fight to maintain reader loyalty through news reporting is finished too. Sure, some people may still cling to the BBC or the New York Times out of habit, but the trend towards decentralisation &#8211; with readers choosing their news source on a story-by-story basis &#8211; is inexorable.There remains, however, one reason to remain loyal to a single newspaper &#8211; or at least to visit that newspaper&#8217;s online edition every day. And that&#8217;s for its editorial voice: the unique tone with which a publication interprets the basic facts of a news story and helps us form an opinion on it. Which, of course, is where columnists come in.Columnists &#8211; and other opinion-driven journalists &#8211; are the heart and soul of a news organisation: they&#8217;re what makes us tune in to Fox News (Glenn Beck, Bill O&#8217;Reilly) or MSNBC (Keith Olbermann). They&#8217;re why we buy the Wall Street Journal (Peggy Noonan) or The New York Times (Maureen Dowd). Newspapers know this of course, which is why when Murdoch desperately (and misguidedly) wanted to protect hard-copy sales of his flagship UK tabloid, The Sun, he removed his big name columnists from the web and confined them to print.Wales may claim that the best political bloggers are better than their mainstream rivals but he&#8217;s wrong about that too. For a start, professional columnists carry with them the weight of their entire publication. Maureen Dowd&#8217;s opinion pieces are so powerful because they are packed with insight and fact, much of which stems from the access she enjoys as an internationally recognised columnist. The vast majority of independent political bloggers can only dream of that kind of access and are instead forced to rely on second-hand reporting for the basis of their writing. But even if a political blogger does manage to deliver the goods, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they&#8217;re snapped up by the mainstream media. I don&#8217;t care what crap they spout while they&#8217;re struggling to make it, every political blogger in the world would kill their own puppy to write for a nationally &#8211; or internationally &#8211; recognised publication. The first thing Nate Silver did when FiveThirtyEight went stellar? Take a gig at the New Republic.This symbiosis &#8211; columnistists clamouring to write for newspapers, and newspapers needing great columnists to define their voice &#8211; is where the real key to the survival of newspapers lies. Rival papers, and bloggers and Twitterers may summarise and rewrite your news scoops, depriving you of readers, but they can&#8217;t do the same with your columnists. Personality is simply not reproducible &#8211; there&#8217;s only one Maureen Dowd and there will only ever be one Glenn Beck (inshallah) so if readers want to hear what they have to say, they have to go to the source. Moreover, while news ages rapidly, opinion doesn&#8217;t. A story published online by the New York Times is dated the moment it appears and people begin tweeting out the key facts, but a well-crafted opinion column has an infinite shelf life.For all of these reasons, only the most imbecilicly terrified newspaper editor would heed Jimmy Wales&#8217; advice and fire their most valuable assets. For all the others, there&#8217;s actually a compelling argument to do precisely the opposite. It&#8217;s comment and opinion, not news, that really adds value to newspapers in the Internet age &#8211; and as such the really smart editors will get rid of all their costly reporters and use the money instead to fill their pages with nothing but highly paid opinion columnists. Only then can newspapers be assured of their survival.I know it sounds scary, newspaper owners, but you&#8217;ll just have to trust me on this one. After all, I&#8217;m The Man From The Internet and I have all the answers.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Made.com,  a web-based furniture company, has raised Â£2.5million from investors to launch its service which connects buyers directly with manufacturers thus cutting out middle men. It will launch initially in the UK, aiming to slash the cost of designer furniture.The backing comes from Lastminute.com cofounder Brent Hoberman now of mydeco.com, PROfounders Capital (whose investors include Michael Birch ex of Bebo), investor John Hunt and Marc Simoncini through his investment vehicle, JaÃ¯na Capital.Made.com was created by 28 year-old serial entrepreneur Ning Li, who was a cofounder of Paris based MyFab.com which has proved the feasibility of connecting furniture buyers with makers. There are still a lot of inefficiencies in the furniture retail industry where furniture can be sold for six to ten times its factory price. The UK homewares market is worth about Â£26billion but itâ\\x80\\x99s very fragmented &#8211; the biggest players like Argos and John Lewis combined add up to just 10%.Made.com aims to more than halve the price of contemporary furniture by cutting out wholesalers and retailers. But the quality of the chair or sofa stays the same &#8211; just the middle guys are gone. The site will focus on designer furniture, sofas, chairs, tables etc but could move into textiles for example.&#8220;The internet helps us provide total transparency and strip out the middlemen,&#8221; says Ning. It perhaps helps that Ning was born in China, in the city of Foshan, which is the countryâ\\x80\\x99s major manufacturing base for furniture. Made.com is working with 20 manufacturers at launch, most in the far East right now and some of them are British manufacturers especially in the upholstery area. In the UK 80% of furniture comes from China.The designs will be crowd-sourced, with customers voting for the ones they like. The most popular designs go into production and the people who voted can buy at a discount. At launch the site will work with designers who are not yet well known names including Luka Stepan, Steuart Padwick, and Alexander Purcell.Orders are then placed direct with a manufacturer for mass production in container quantities from factories in China. The orders will be shipped to the UK and their progress is trackable on the web site. Thus there is no unsold inventory and no wastage.The PROfounders investment is the second it&#8217;s announced after Tweetdeck.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Mozilla platform engineer Rob Sayre has probably had better ideas.Hoping Microsoft might allow Firefox on their new Windows Phone 7 Series, Sayre wrote an open letter this morning to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. &#8220;Hola, amigo. I know itâ\\x80\\x99s been a long time since I rapped at ya,&#8221; is how it starts.He then proceeds to make fun of Windows Phone 7 Series, the iPhone, Cocoa Touch, and Unix â\\x80\\x94 all in three concise paragraphs. He notes that Windows Phone 7 Series has a &#8220;busted&#8221; UI, calls the iPhone&#8217;s UI &#8220;ugly jelly beans,&#8221; and mocks the &#8220;allegedly cool&#8221; Cocoa Touch &#8220;stuff.&#8221;Once he&#8217;s done with all of that, he asks Ballmer to consider making an NDK for Windows Phone. An NDK is a companion tool for an SDK that allows you to build parts of apps in native code. For example, it&#8217;s the Android NDK that allows Mozilla to make Firefox for Android.There&#8217;s currently no plans to make an NDK for Windows Phone 7 phones â\\x80\\x94 hence Sayre&#8217;s post. Without it, a version of Firefox for the OS is probably unlikely. And that may be a good bet anyway, considering Microsoft seems to be pivoting its new phones closer to the iPhone&#8217;s closed model rather than Android&#8217;s open one.Sayre&#8217;s approach to the post apparently didn&#8217;t go over too well â\\x80\\x94 he quickly followed up with an apology post, &#8220;Things I&#8217;ve Learned.&#8221; &#8220;Blog posts that sound like Jim Anchower really irritate people for some reason.

But what did eBay founder Pierre Omidyar do? Moved to Honolulu where he can be found sitting on beaches.But donâ\\x80\\x99t let the top line narrative fool you, Omidyar hasnâ\\x80\\x99t just been looking at sunsets all these years. Heâ\\x80\\x99s been busy making good on his commitment to give away some 99% of his multi-billion dollar fortune and lately has been launching Peer News, a new kind of online news service that wonâ\\x80\\x99t have reporters or articles in the classic sense, nor will it allow anonymous comments or make money off advertising. Heâ\\x80\\x99s definitely got at least the media world captivated once again.eBay, philanthropy and now a local Hawaiian news site may seem like wildly disparate ventures for the same man to take, but as Omidyar explains in the video below theyâ\\x80\\x99re all connected by the ideas of platform and communityâ\\x80\\x94two words that have also underlined much of the Web 2.0 movement.Just like eBay was a platform that gave people everywhere the opportunity to build out a business and change their economic reality, so too does the Omidyar Network seek to give passionate, would-be entrepreneurs an opportunity to change their world and their reality. As Omidyar puts it, he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a â\\x80\\x9ccause;â\\x80\\x9d he gets excited about other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s causes. Similarly at eBay he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a collector, but he loved hearing about other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s collections.On community, eBay was one of the first places that pioneered trust online through its reputation and feedback systems. Omidyar is hoping to bring that same kind of trust and fair-dealing to the local news world with Peer Newsâ\\x80\\x94which is the reason anonymous commenters will not be welcome.Omidyar talks about all of this and more in the video below, shot in his office in Honolulu. I started out by asking him about that great founders myth that he started eBay so his wife could trade Pez dispensers. (The one people claimed years later was just a good pitch for reporters.)',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When I first read about Hunch&#8217;s Twitter Predictor game, I was pretty skeptical. The game asks you to put in your Twitter user name and based on who you follow and who you are followed by, it predicts how you will answer questions on Hunch. Then I used it. It&#8217;s awesome. Well, pretty awesome.Out of 35 questions I answer, Hunch correctly predicted by my answer to 32 of them and was only wrong with 3, 91% correct. And these aren&#8217;t just &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; question, some have several possible answers. In fact, the game got so many right that at first I was sure it was all fake and they were just saying they were going to pick what I eventually did. Then I noticed the &#8220;take a peek&#8221; link, which tells you before you answer the question how you&#8217;re going to answer it.I also wondered if Hunch was simply predicting how I&#8217;d answer based on other Hunch questions I had answered on my account. But actually, the game works even if you&#8217;re logged out of your Hunch account.So yes, the predictor made by new Hunch employee Ben Gleitzman (a former Googler) is very accurate. But then I noticed something. As I played it again in another browser, the game asked the exact same questions. And the first question is always about my age range. So this is likely one of the keys to how the predictor works. Another friend had a series of questions that made it clear she was a woman â\\x80\\x94 likely another key predictor.I would bet the game is quickly scanning your Twitter followers and getting some obvious topical data, such as age range and sex. Then it uses the aggregate Hunch data that the service has collected over the past several months.Still, it&#8217;s a pretty cool idea. And a great way to show off the data Hunch is collecting.

BoomStartup just launched an incubator in Utah and TechStars is expanding to other cities in the U.S., as is The Founder Institute. Chicago has a new incubator that recently launched, called Excelerate Labs. Excelerate is the brainchild of OKCupid entrepreneur Sam Yagan, Kapil Chaudhary, Kelli Rhee, and Troy Henikoff. Yagan says the Chicago-based incubator has a similar model to TechStars and Y Combinator. Six to ten startups will be chosen for a three month long program, where founders will be given resources to build their products, access to mentors and funding. Each startup will receive anywhere from $15,000 to $20,000 (depending on the number of founders) for five percent of equity.The program is currently accepting applications until April 2. Yagan says that one of the reasons that we wanted to start the program was to help make Chicago become &#8220;the Silicon Valley of the Midwest.&#8221; Sandbox Industries and i2a Fund have invested in the incubator, but Yagan says that other venture funds have taken an active interest in Excelerate, including DFJ Mercury. Mentors include TechStars founder David Cohen, OpenTable&#8217;s Chuck Templeton, Apex Ventures Partners&#8217; Lon Chow and a host of other notable entrepreneurs and investors. Groupon directors Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell, also recently launched Lightbank and will invest as much as $10 million annually in early-stage technology companies through a new fund dubbed. Similar to Excelerate, the fund aims to help establish Chicago as a technology hub. It&#8217;s always great to see investors and former tech executives investing time (and money) in promising startups and ideas. And we are seeing a plethora of innovative startups emerging from a variety of incubators around the country and world, including Y Combinator,  TechStars, The Founder Institute, Launchbox Digital and more.

       "  'comments_content': 'When I came to the U.S. in 1980, I was young and naÃ¯ve. I used to think that corruption and ethical lapses were just a third-world ill. Eventually, I became a tech CEO and learned the harsh realities of American business. Yes, standards are much higher, and breaches are punished, but the temptations are just the same here as they are in any other country. Ethical lapses (which are a form of corruption) are quite common.Â\\xa0 You watch stories about these on TV every other day and read about them on TechCrunch.Â\\xa0 It was the ethical lapses of our financial institutions that threw our economy into a tailspin, and for which we are paying the price, after all.It is best to be aware of the temptations and to prevent the lapses from occurring. As Enron, Bernie Madoff, and Lehman Brothers have shown, itâ\\x80\\x99s a slippery slope. Once you start compromising your values for short-term gains, there is no turning back. Business ethics are not something you need to start worrying about when your company reaches a certain size; they need to be sewn into the fabric of your startup from the get-go. The lessons are the same for tech businesses as they are for investment banks and for third-world economies.Harvard Business School professor Michael Beer researched the difference between companies that perform at high levels for extended periods and those that implode when they reach a certain size. When analyzing the spectacular failures in the recent financial meltdown, he found that:â\\x80¢ Of the original Forbes 100 (named in 1917), 61 had ceased to exist by 1987. Â\\xa0Of the remaining 39, only 18 stayed in the top 100, and their return during the period 1917 to 1987 was 20% less than that of the overall market.â\\x80¢ Of companies in the original Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index of 1957, only 74 remained in 1997; of these, only 12 outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the period 1957 to 1998.â\\x80¢ The average CEO tenure in the U.S. is 4.2 years, less than half the 10.5-year average in 1990.Beer posited three core reasons for the failure of so many Wall Street firms in the fall of 2008: the firms lacked a higher purpose (in other words, they were focused on short-term gains, profits, and bonuses); they lacked a clear strategy; and they mismanaged their risk. Companies like Charles Schwab and US Bancorp were able to avoid the fallout by having a laser-like focus on customer service and on honesty and transparency. Neither company touched the subprime mortgage securitization market, because they saw it as risky and simply not the kind of business that served the company&#8217;s long-term interests.Even outside Wall Street, companies like Cisco Systems, Southwest Airlines, and Costco Wholesale, with the strongest sense of higher purpose, achieved the greatest success. Take Costco. Wall Street analysts have long chastised Costco&#8217;s management for paying high wages and keeping employees around for a long time, because this results in higher benefits costs. But the companyâ\\x80\\x99s CEO, Jim Sinegal, lives by his belief that keeping good employees is strategic for Costcoâ\\x80\\x99s long-term success and growth. The companyâ\\x80\\x99s per-employee sales are considerably higher than those of key rivals such as Target and Wal-Mart; customer service at the stores is phenomenal and fast; and Costco continues to expand, both in number of warehouses and in products and services for business and consumer customers. The culture of the company flows downward from Sinegal and his focus on employees and, by extension, to customers.One of the problems that Beer found with the failed banks was that their employees lacked the ability to â\\x80\\x9cspeak truth to powerâ\\x80\\x9d. Employees felt intimidated by superiors; the institutionsâ\\x80\\x99 internal voice of conscience and purpose was silenced by a maniacal focus on short-term profits and whatever scheme would bring them in. The silencing of employees who sought to challenge strategy and risk-management practices likely also undermined the banks&#8217; moral authority and emboldened those who already felt inclined to do the wrong thing. With a muted internal voice, these organizations lacked a moral compass. As a result, they drove off a cliff with astonishing speed.The same things happen in Silicon Valley companies. Â\\xa0I asked management guru â\\x80\\x94 and head of the CEO Institute of Yale School of Management â\\x80\\x94 Jeff Sonnenfeld for his advice on how startups can sow the seeds for building a Cisco or Costco. Here is Jeffâ\\x80\\x99s advice:1)Â\\xa0 Create a culture of openness and welcome dissent â\\x80\\x93 Internal constructive critics are your best friends â\\x80\\x94 too often, founders are blinded by their own enthusiasm for their creative vision and then are surrounded by sycophants, kissing up. Founders who fall out of touch rapidly lose their ethical bearings. At Intel, founder Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore did not look for sycophantic followers in selecting the brilliant, contentious, but relentlessly honest Andy Grove as their colleague and successor. Similarly, Craig Barrett and Paul Otellini have consistently fought for different points of view internally â\\x80\\x94 without undermining the enterprise, and always reinforcing Intelâ\\x80\\x99s self-critical core ethic. 2)Â\\xa0 Lead by example. Â\\xa0The authenticity of the leaderâ\\x80\\x99s character is essential â\\x80\\x94 if colleagues donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you, they will not take needed risks on your behalf â\\x80\\x94 such as training subordinates to be able to do their own jobs. Â\\xa0Startups are often defined by the hip clichÃ©s of VC firms, adoring press, and HR consultants â\\x80\\x94 but the startups donâ\\x80\\x99t really practice what they preach.3)Â\\xa0 Learn from immediate peers or distant models. Too often, founders atrophy because they believe that the unique quality of their business or technological mission means that they too are truly unique in leadership values.Â\\xa0 Steve Jobs has patterned himself after Polaroid founder Ed Land â\\x80\\x94 and tried to learn from Landâ\\x80\\x99s strengths and weaknesses.Â\\xa0 Henry Ford regretfully once claimed â\\x80\\x9cHistory is bunkâ\\x80\\x9d but in reality revered Thomas Edison.Â\\xa0 Michael Dell put legendary tech entrepreneur (Teledyne) and educator Dr. George Kozmetsky on his board right from the start to learn from this brilliant then septuagenarian.4)Â\\xa0 Recognize your own fallibility as a leader, know your limits, and beware of the myth of immortality.Â\\xa0 Entrepreneurs often are horrified at the thought of leadership succession. The founders of great firms such as Google, Cisco, Amgen, and Microsoft have known that they would need to prepare for a day when they no longer could be the lone day-to-day internal boss, primary external ambassador, and symbolic cultural icon. The founder of the original (pre-Starbucks) coffee house chain Chock-Full-o-Nuts started his first cafÃ© on BroadwayÂ\\xa043rd Street in 1923 and was a great national success.Â\\xa0 Sadly, sixty years later, as a dying man who had been flat on his back for two years at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he still clung to the job of leader of the enterprise, his full-time physician serving as acting president.5)Â\\xa0 Remember that institutional character â\\x80\\x94 like a liquid cupped in your hand â\\x80\\x94 is fragile; easily lost; and hard, if not impossible, to regain. Egomaniacal moves, personal grandiosity, greed, and deception create impressions that are hard to erase.Â\\xa0 Whole Foods founder, John Mackey, sabotaged the integrity of his own exalted brand, damaging the companyâ\\x80\\x99s internal pride and customer admiration far more badly than any competitor could have, due to his self-inflating and his misleading â\\x80\\x9canonymousâ\\x80\\x9d blogging, hiding his identity through an anagram of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s name, â\\x80\\x9crehodab.â\\x80\\x9dIâ\\x80\\x99ll add another very important point: Establish an independent board. Venture firms often demand a majority of board seats as a condition for their investments. Conflicts invariably arise. The board begins to serve the needs of VCs and management, rather than of the company itself, which loses the independent voice to warn it not to do the wrong things. The inconvenient truth is that all board members have a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of the company, and not in their own interests. Board members must not engage in transactions in which they or their partners stand to gain.  They are legally required to avoid these conflicts of interest. Finally, remember that in business, you have to make tough choices at every juncture. Though business decisions usually have clear consequences and outcomes, ethical decisions are always hard. Making the right choice doesn&#8217;t always bring success, but ethical lapses almost always lead to failure. No matter what the consequence, doing what&#8217;s ethical and right is always the better long-term strategy.Editorâ\\x80\\x99s note: Guest writer Vivek Wadhwa is   an entrepreneur turned academic.

       "  'comments_content': 'I didn&#8217;t have the same problems at SXSW this year that some people did. Was it too crowded at some events? Sure. But there were plenty of alternative things to do. Did some of the keynotes bomb? Yes. But there were plenty of other things to listen to. Did AT&amp;T fail? No. Actually, they did an awesome job keeping the network up. Instead, I had a problem of a different kind: check-in fatigue.Seeing as location was this year&#8217;s Twitter at SXSW, and seeing as I write a lot about location, I wanted to try to use as many of the services as I could during the actual conference. I drastically underestimated how much work that would actually be.At first, I was using all of the services I had on my phone to check-in when I arrived at a place in Austin. This included: Foursquare, Gowalla, Loopt, Whrrl, Brightkite, Burbn, MyTown,Â\\xa0CauseWorld,Â\\xa0Hot Potato, Plancast, and (at certain places) Foodspotting. Even with great AT&amp;T service, this would take a solid 10 minutes or more to check-in to all of them. And it took even longer when I&#8217;d have to pause to explain to my friends what the hell I was doing on my phone all that time.This was at every venue we stopped at. The situation simply wasn&#8217;t tenable.By the second day, I had cut the services I would check-in to in half. It still wasn&#8217;t close to being something I would consider doing on a regular basis.Â\\xa0By the end of my time in Austin, I was down to using only two services â\\x80\\x94 yes, the two in the midst of the &#8220;war&#8221; â\\x80\\x94 Foursquare and Gowalla.Pretty much everyone I knew in Austin were also using both Foursquare and Gowalla to send out all their check-ins. And all seemed to agree: it was still too tedious to use even just two services to do the same thing. In the end, there should be only one.And so it should be no surprise that a few companies are already working on a solution for this problem. One is by the creators of Brightkite, who managed to obtain the killer check.in domain name. The team showed me a preview of the app at a party one night, and I immediately knew it was exactly what I needed (see a preview of it here).And LocationFu is another (web-based) app that allows you to check-in with Foursquare, Brightkite, Fire Eagle, and Twitter simultaneously.But there&#8217;s a problem with these solutions too. Currently, Gowalla&#8217;s API is read-only, which means you actually can&#8217;t use another app to check-in to the service. I spoke with CEO Josh Williams a bit about this just prior to SXSW, and he noted that the main thinking behind this is to maintain the user experience Gowalla is looking for (a very Apple-like argument). But, he did say that eventually he thinks they will open up a two-way API â\\x80\\x94 maybe once they have time to create some best practices documentation, he noted.Another problem is that currently each of these check-in services has their own places database. That means that a place on Foursquare may be slightly different than a place on Gowalla, even though they&#8217;re technically the same place. Worse, there are plenty of duplicates for some venues since people are allowed to create their own. Check.in works around this place problem by doing a look-up on each service and letting you pick the correct check-in spot. But it&#8217;s a bit slow, and still seems rather tedious.A better solution would be for the various services to adopt a standard for places. The Activity Streams group is working on such a concept. Yahoo may also be able to implement such a system on top of its WOEID system. Of course, any service that adopts such a standard would be risking at least part of their business since these place databases are one of the keys to each service.Meanwhile, Facebook is thinking about aggregating data from both Foursquare and Gowalla for its own upcoming location implementation. Might that be the one location stop to rule them all (of course, the writing back to Gowalla would still likely be an issue)? Not if Twitter has anything to say about it.I love that all these startups are emerging around location right now (at least a dozen more have emailed me just since I&#8217;ve been back from SXSW). But I&#8217;m starting to worry that this is going to turn into a repeat of the social wars, where we all have 15 different profiles we constantly have to update across a range of networks.During our Realtime Crunchup last year, I brought up this issue during our panel on location. All the players on stage (including Twitter, Foursquare, Hot Potato, Google Latitude, GeoAPI, and SimpleGeo) seemed to want to say that they could all get along and play nicely together for the betterment of location as a whole. I didn&#8217;t buy it then, and I&#8217;m definitely not buying it now.From a business perspective, it doesn&#8217;t make sense for these guys to all play nicely with one another and make it so you don&#8217;t have to use their services. The need to take steps to ensure that you will use their service, and will do so instead of a rival service. That&#8217;s the way it works, and that&#8217;s the way it has always worked. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a war. Right now, it&#8217;s just the early stages where all sides are arming themselves. Soon, they&#8217;ll try to kill one another. And that may not be such a bad thing.[photo: flickr/intagiblearts]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'During my recent trip to India, I flew down to Bangalore for one reason: To meet N.R. Narayana Murthy. Murthy is the co-founder, executive chairman and former CEO for 21 years of Infosys, the first Indian company to go public on Nasdaq and effectively the company that began the $30 billion Indian IT outsourcing market.Murthyâ\\x80\\x99s idea was so successful that it quickly became controversialâ\\x80\\x94not only within the United States where some Americans feel Indians are â\\x80\\x9cstealing jobs,â\\x80\\x9d but also in India where many are concerned about a tech economy that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make anything. I wanted to meet with Murthy, because in many ways he&#8217;s the best person to address what Indians at home and abroad are facing and where Indian entrepreneurship goes from here.Here are a few highlights from our meeting:His Day Job. Murthy thought he was stepping down from Infosys back in 2002, but he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t fully let go. As such, he still works pretty much full time for the company, traveling to meet with customers and running a lot of the companyâ\\x80\\x99s mentoring and training programs. The more surprising aspect of his job: He personally signs off on the architecture of every building on each one of Infosysâ\\x80\\x99 campuses that employ some 17,000 people around the world. The one we were sitting in was spread of eight acres and had some remarkable buildings, including one that looked like the Luxor casino in Las Vegas.I asked why this was a top priorityâ\\x80\\x94after all, many Valley campuses are plush but from an architecture standpoint look about the same. He said when GE and other American multinationals were starting to come into his business everyone thought Infosys would lose the local talent war. So Murthy studied why people want to work at a particular place. One of the results was the comfort and design of the facilities. That was in 1994 when Infosys was designing the very building we were sitting in as we had this conversation. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been in charge of every building since&#8211; all over the world,â\\x80\\x9d he says.Hurting or Helping Local Entrepreneurship? Given exactly how plush Murthy and his colleagues have worked to make Infosys, has he indirectly hurt Bangaloreâ\\x80\\x99s entrepreneurship scene by making the risk of leaving so daunting? He smiled when I asked this and said, â\\x80\\x9cWe may have unwittingly. But I do feel like the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and kicking in Bangalore.â\\x80\\x9dFurther, I asked about Bangaloreâ\\x80\\x99s Zippo-flipping, free-spending generation of young techies whoâ\\x80\\x99ve graduated to a huge wave of multinational jobs that pay them far more than their parents ever made, in many cases more than the rest of their families combined. Murthy didnâ\\x80\\x99t deny that that instant-gratification, &#8220;gimmie&#8221; contingent was strong in the city he helped build, economically speaking. But he blames the Internet and the mass-cross-pollination of Western pop culture, not the bigger paycheck from companies like his.â\\x80\\x9cWe are moving towards a uniform, global culture with an intense competitive spirit and an intense desire for instant gratification,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cBut I have a firm belief that each generation is better than the previous one. The Indian entrepreneurs today are more daring than we were.â\\x80\\x9d (This from a man who became a capitalist after after hitchhiking across communist Eastern Europe and getting thrown in jail for chatting up someoneâ\\x80\\x99s girlfriend on a train. â\\x80\\x9cMore daringâ\\x80\\x9d is a tall order, young Indian techies.) Is Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s Tech Community Too Addicted to Services? Clearly, services has been a great business for Infosys and the hundreds of dollar-millionaires and even more rupee-millionaires that the companyâ\\x80\\x99s generous stock program has created. But a lot of Indian CEOs and investors complain that in most cases services-based tech businesses are a great way to get revenues quick, but not a way to build a huge, high-growth business. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a big question of whether Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s tech sector has a worrying lack of product-building know-how.Murthy says itâ\\x80\\x99s a progression. â\\x80\\x9cIndia missed the industrial revolution, but Indians had intelligence,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cWe had to make do with pen and paper. We were always forced to look at the abstract. What is happening in India today is the creation of jobs. Letâ\\x80\\x99s create jobs as long as they are legal and ethical, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter, as long as we make money. The time will come for creating products. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t lose sleep over this. If we create enough jobs weâ\\x80\\x99ll raise the confidence of the youngsters and theyâ\\x80\\x99ll create products.â\\x80\\x9d Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s Infrastructure. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s something itâ\\x80\\x99s hard for even Murthy to be upbeat about: Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s shoddy physical infrastructure. Murthy has traveled the world and itâ\\x80\\x99s frustrating that so much money has poured into the country he loves, and yet, the infrastructure is still so shockingly bad.There is progressâ\\x80\\x94Infosys for instance has benefited from a new overpass that cuts down on the drive to the campus by more than thirty minutes. (See!) But itâ\\x80\\x99s not moving nearly fast enough, he says. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know if we will reach the level of the United States or China,â\\x80\\x9d he adds.Murthy gave a more nuanced explanation than the usual â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s corruptionâ\\x80\\x9d answer you get in India. He explained that 65% of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s population lives in rural areas and 35% live in cities. And thereâ\\x80\\x99s such polarity between the quality of life that politicians have to appear to be doing more for the villages than the cities if they want to get re-elected. That leaves prosperous economic cities blighted by poor sewage systems, pollution spewing generators and beggars weaving through traffic tapping on car windows. â\\x80\\x9cDifferent emerging nations take different paths,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIn China, they chose to emphasize giving people economic freedom first and political freedom second. In India we chose the opposite path.â\\x80\\x9d Hurting or Helping US-based Indians? All you have to do is read the comments on one of Vivek Wadhwaâ\\x80\\x99s posts to see the ugly, anti-immigrant, anti-Indian fervor thatâ\\x80\\x99s been whipped up in America, post-recession. A lot of it has to do with outsourcing. I asked Murthy if he felt his company and industryâ\\x80\\x99s huge success has indirectly made life harder for Indian-Americans. He turned the blame on xenophobes like Lou Dobbs and grandstanding politicians who use the wedge issue to get viewers and votes.But itâ\\x80\\x99s an issue he has to address a lot. He answers it by saying every morning he gets up and gets a Pepsi out of his GE Fridge and drives his American car to work where he sits down at his Dell computer. India used to have companies that made soft drinks, refrigerators, cars and computers. But the American ones were better. Allowing them in hurt Indian workers in the short term, but provided a far better quality of life for a much bigger swath of Indians long term. He argues outsourcing has done the same thing for US companies. Greater efficiencies and cost-savings enables these companies to stay competitive and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason they canâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94in theoryâ\\x80\\x94plow those savings into better local jobs or job training.This argument isnâ\\x80\\x99t going to pacify hate-mongers, because nothing will. Murthy knows that too and while he regrets it, he seems to accept it as reality. Advice for Entrepreneurs. Murthy has started a $170 million venture fund, so although he spends most of his time still at Infosys, he clearly cares about encouraging the next generation of entrepreneurs. He had two big pieces of advice for them. One, be able to articulate what you do in one sentence. If you canâ\\x80\\x99t, you donâ\\x80\\x99t have a good idea. And two, make sure the market is ready. Businesses are killed, not congratulated, for being ahead of their time.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Back in June, Google launched Sputnik, a suite of tools that runs over 5,000 tests to check a web browser&#8217;s JavaScript conformance. Last week, they made the tool a lot easier for anyone to use, with a version that works in the web browser. The results are interesting.Notably, both the Opera and Safari web browsers beat Google&#8217;s own Chrome browser in the test. As you can see in the picture above, Opera is the clear leader, with only 78 failures (the closer to the center, the less errors). Safari came in second with 159 errors, with Chrome in third with 218 errors. Firefox is close behind with 259 errors, while Internet Explorer is the outlier with 463 errors.These tests were run on Windows machines, with the latest released version of each browser. Using the web tool on my Mac, though, shows similar results (at least for Opera, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox â\\x80\\x94 there is no IE for Mac anymore).While much of the focus on JavaScript is about speed (that&#8217;s what the SunSpider test measures, for example), Sputnik is interesting because it focuses on conformity, making it more like the Acid3 test, which tests web standards compliance. Chrome, Safari, and Opera have all passed Acid3, with Firefox getting very close (94/100 for Firefox 3.6). IE, meanwhile, again lags behind with just 20/100 for IE8. And even the new IE9 preview only scores 55/100.Speaking of IE9, I tried to run the Sputnik tool in the preview build of the new browser on Windows 7. Unfortunately, it completely shut down several times after getting up to about 50 failures after only a few hundred of the 5,000+ tests â\\x80\\x94 not a good sign. But again, it&#8217;s just a very early preview release of the browser, and early SunSpider results for the browser have been good.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'If you&#8217;re a photographer and use a Mac, chances are you&#8217;re using Lightroom or Aperture. Probably Lightroom, since Aperture is less popular among pros &mdash; and the latest version seems to be an acknowledgment of that. The features added in version 3 are clearly intended to draw casual shooters using iPhoto to the paid image editing honey pot. Since so many of these amazing new features are direct side-loads from iPhoto, it smooths the process and makes the program as a whole more approachable, though whether existing Aperture users will find them helpful is questionable. Brushes, on the other hand, are a welcome addition to any photographer&#8217;s toolset, and depending on how dedicated you are, may be worth the price of admission.Invasion of the iPhoto featuresAs long as I&#8217;ve been using Aperture, I&#8217;ve considered it a processing application. Its photo management was troublesome here and there, and iPhoto had the best ways of showing off your shots, but I dealt with it since maintaining two separate libraries of the same photos would be disk space suicide. I&#8217;ve only used Lightroom a little bit (and a version or two back) but all my friends say that it just has a better workflow for serious photo work &mdash; importing a couple hundred shots, scrubbing through them, doing the necessary adjustments, and outputting to the necessary format. Not that I have trouble doing that in Aperture, but apparently it&#8217;s faster and better in Lightroom.Confronted with such a fearsome opponent, Apple decided that it would be better to flank than to risk a frontal assault. Hence the expansion of Aperture&#8217;s incorporation of iPhoto features Faces and Places. I question their relevance in a photo processing application, but given Apple&#8217;s tendency towards coalescing functionality, I&#8217;m guessing that iPhoto will eventually be Aperture: Gimped Edition, and the only real choice for organizing and messing with large numbers of photos will be Aperture.There are some kinks to be worked out. Faces plainly doesn&#8217;t work. After it spent literally five hours going through my photos (about 1000 per hour), this is what it has come up with:No, it didn&#8217;t have a lot to go on (I hadn&#8217;t &#8220;trained&#8221; it much yet) but really now. After giving it a few more pointers on what I looked like, it still mistook a three-year-old tow-headed girl, my friend Monica (who is Indian, and in a wedding dress), some E3 booth babes, and Casio president Kazuo Kashio for pale, bearded, Devin Coldewey. The cork board background is jarring (you can change it but the corny, inefficient &#8220;polaroid&#8221; interface and font remain) and the interface for going through your shots is terrible. I realize this is a technology still being perfected, and that is why I am wondering: what is it doing in my RAW editing program?Places is useful if you have a geotagging camera (still rare) or want to spend a few hours dragging and dropping stuff onto the map. It can be fun, actually, if you take a lot of pictures of your friends, and want to drag and drop this or that night onto the location you went to; it&#8217;s like creating a different kind of album (&#8220;Linda&#8217;s Tavern&#8221;), and indeed you can make a browsable smart album from locations. If you&#8217;re like me, you won&#8217;t feel complete until the photos are more or less where they were within the city, and not all grouped in a single pin, smack in the middle of the city. This could have some promise, but with a backlog of several thousand shots, getting a library up to date in Places is a task I wouldn&#8217;t wish on my worst enemy.It&#8217;s a mistake to judge Faces and Places by simply saying &#8220;well we were fine before them,&#8221; because it may just be that we found ways of working in the old system of organization (Project>Folder>Album) that approximated what these new features do. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wrong to say they just don&#8217;t really do much, and feel out of place to boot. You have to work at them, or shoot for them, in order for them to really be worthwhile. Still I have to give credit where credit&#8217;s due: if you just consider Faces and Places new columns to organize by (like rating or date) then they&#8217;re worth their salt. As flagship features, though, they&#8217;re duds.Lastly, the slide show thing. It&#8217;s like finding a trout in the milk. Not that it doesn&#8217;t work &mdash; it works as well as iPhoto&#8217;s thing, and I suppose it&#8217;s better to have than not. It&#8217;s just a little weird to have a sort of&#8230; aftermarket feature popped in there next to the serious editing tools. Its little presets are, like in most Apple programs, 25% solid, 75% fluff. Who in the name of all that is holy is going to pick &#8220;Shatter&#8221; as their slide show transition? It&#8217;s ghastly.The new features are very well explained in little videos accessible through the &#8220;Welcome&#8221; screen, which will be handy for new users &mdash; if they can find the screen after they close it (it&#8217;s in Help>Welcome to Aperture).The good stuffSo if the iPhoto features are icing, the actual cake is the RAW editing, adjustment tools, and user interface. Let&#8217;s start with what I would say is the best new feature: Brushes.You can see a pretty thorough overview of the feature at Apple&#8217;s site, but the gist is that it allows you to apply certain effects in limited areas using a brush of adjustable size and intensity. That&#8217;s great! I can&#8217;t count the number of times I&#8217;ve vacillated between two versions of a photo where an adjustment necessary for one part ended up blowing out another, or I just wanted to bring out the color in the eyes but not in the background. A lot of fiddling could usually approximate the effect I wanted, but it would be so much easier to just use a brush. I&#8217;ll be using the hell out of this feature, and it&#8217;s perhaps the only real step Apple took against Adobe in this update.(combination Brushes and Help Video screenshot)The brushes are non-destructive, like any of the dials and curves you can play with in the adjustments panel, so you can feel free to experiment, layer, and try out different effects. One thing I often have to do when shooting review shots is emphasize the color of LEDs, but if the subject is well-lit, the LEDs are going to be barely visible. No problem; make a little brush, add in a little contrast right there, bump the saturation just in the one area, and boom, it sticks out like a sore thumb. Brushes are useful for lots of little things like that.The new full-screen browser is handy but not really a revolution. They&#8217;ve added the ability to get around your library a little more, which is nice, but it&#8217;s not as streamlined as the regular browser, which is always accessible by a single keystroke. The fullscreen presentation has definitely been improved, however, and when showing off photos to friends or clients, it&#8217;s a better option than either the plain editing window or a slide show.The preset adjustments, I think we can agree, are being blown way out of proportion; Apple&#8217;s breathless description sets them up to be quite the killer feature. Unfortunately, these are the same kind of &#8220;professional adjustments&#8221; that you have been able to apply on cheap point-and-shoots since the beginning of time. There are a few quick adjust things like high-contrast black-and-white or exposure +1 that are nice to have previews for (the live preview window is handy), but let&#8217;s be honest, these are just filters. I&#8217;d like to be able to say that they&#8217;re carefully adjusted so you won&#8217;t see weird color effects, blackouts, or blowouts, but the fact is every one I tried looked cheap and overdone. The others, like white balance and so on, seem pretty redundant considering the actual controls for adjusting those aspects are mere pixels away in the same window.Click to see it larger. You can&#8217;t really tell here, since this photo isn&#8217;t very high contrast, but in several of the other shots I tried this on, the vintage look was really purple, cross-processing was really green, and toy camera pushed the contrast way too far. Subtle adjustments these are not.The good news is that people new to the program might try a couple, see that they were created by dragging curves and color bars around, and then make their own. I&#8217;ve had my own &#8220;base&#8221; adjustment for years now, which was just as easily accessible and just as customizable, though limited to a single adjustment category. Putting together a &#8220;look&#8221; for a shoot using this feature might be easier now than before, but it&#8217;s still just a toy at this point.The ability to have multiple libraries is nice; splitting work and personal stuff would be my move, so that if a meteor crashed into TC HQ (or, more likely, I&#8217;m fired for insubordination), I could free up a couple gigs in one clean sweep. It&#8217;s also convenient for backing up and sharing; &#8220;here&#8217;s my whole &#8216;wedding&#8217; library, feel free to do what you like with it&#8221; rather than &#8220;here&#8217;s a folder full of RAW files.&#8221; (Update: my mistake, multiple libraries were already available.)A quick noteJust a PSA: installation of Aperture 3 took ages. Plan on losing at least a working day to 100% processor usage as it converts your library, searches for Faces, and reprocesses your RAW files with the new profile. I&#8217;m not holding this against Apple (it&#8217;s a LOT of data to sift through) but it&#8217;s just something to be aware of.ConclusionAperture is still a great program, in my opinion, and the budding photographer would be a lot better off with this than with iPhoto if they&#8217;re planning on doing anything more than collecting snapshots. I&#8217;ve gotten used to Aperture&#8217;s workflow and they haven&#8217;t changed it much in 3, in fact they&#8217;ve provided a couple serious improvements with Brushes and potentially Places and Faces &mdash; you know, if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing.The trouble I see is that Aperture, once a rather single-minded program, is being diluted with features that have nothing to do with its core functionality. Why not have a new program, called &#8220;Collection&#8221; or something, that hooks into all your libraries, allows for creating robust slide shows, exporting directly to Facebook, and all that sort of thing? Putting all this junk into Aperture is doing to it what Apple has done to iTunes: once a sleek and straightforward program, it has now grown bloated beyond comprehension; it&#8217;s a bit like seeing a once-great fighter gone to seed. I have more of an attachment to Aperture than to iTunes, but if Aperture 4 continues along the vector indicated by Aperture 3, you can consider me a Lightroom conversion.Give Aperture 3 a 30-day trial for free here. $199 to buy, $99 to upgrade.Update: I completely neglected to mention that Aperture 3 also now has full 64-bit support. This means newer macs sporting Snow Leopard and adequate hardware should get a sweet performance boost.Also: wow, guys. Take it easy. I didn&#8217;t insult your children. I&#8217;m not sure where I suggested that Aperture is the worst app ever made, or attempted to do anything other than hit the major new features and give what can really only be my first impressions, having used Aperture for a couple years but A3 only having been out for a month. What can I say? The core functionality is unchanged, and I feel half the new features are specious, suggesting the feature creep that has characterized Apple applications in the last few years.',\n",

Unfortunately, it was also pretty bare boned â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you couldn&#8217;t even save your edited document to your hard drive.  Today, that&#8217;s changing: Crocodoc has rolled out some key new features (including the ability to save) that make the service significantly more flexible, and also pits it more directly against Adobe&#8217;s Acrobat Pro.Aside from the ability to save to PDF, the new version includes a freehand pen tool, a tool to convert any website to PDF (which you can then add notes to), and a new API.  In a few days, the company will be releasing its application on Google&#8217;s recently-launched App Marketplace. The service will also be rolling out a Flash-based embeddable document viewer (similar to what you&#8217;ll find on DocStoc and Scribd) that lets you both view and mark up embedded documents.CEO Ryan Damico says that these features make Crocodoc more competitive with Adobe&#8217;s $400 Acrobat Pro software because the free Acrobat Reader most people have doesn&#8217;t allow them to mark up and save their documents (personally, I&#8217;ve been avoiding any software with the word &#8216;Acrobat&#8217; in its title for years).  Damico does acknowledge that there are still plenty of premium features that Crocodoc doesn&#8217;t have that Adobe&#8217;s paid software does, but says that this basic editing/saving functionality is what most people are after, anyway.  DamicoÂ\\xa0says that in the long term, Crocodoc is hoping to &#8220;do to Acrobat what Gmail did to Outlook&#8221; by taking a widely used desktop application and bringing it online.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: This post was written by Joe Stump, the co-founder of SimpleGeo, a geolocation infrastructure company. While much of the focus in location these days is on the front-end side of things, SimpleGeo focuses on the backend, allowing startups to very easily get started with geolocation.There&#8217;s been a lot of coverage lately about the location &#8220;war&#8221; between Gowalla and Foursquare. Nobody is arguing that Gowalla and Foursquare aren&#8217;t, on some levels, competing, but I do think a lot of people are missing the big picture here. Which is the impending location gold rush.My cofounder, Matt Galligan, and I firmly believe that location is in a similar position as social was in 2001 or so. By that I mean that, at the time, social was very nascent, but exciting as it gave us a whole new view of the data we consume every day. Over the course of almost 10 years we&#8217;ve seen social get baked into everything from photo sharing to financial tools. I think that location, similarly, gives us an interesting new view of our data.This momentum has been slowly gaining steam since, essentially, the iPhone was released. We, the developers and general nerd populous, finally had an open platform that had location (in the form of latitude and longitude of our users) baked into it. The first wave of location services made location the core feature. Much like social, this isn&#8217;t sustainable long-term. You can&#8217;t be &#8220;Some Company plus location&#8221; and expect to sustain users. Especially after Some Company enables location themselves.Which bring us to the second wave of location, which I think was started by our friends at Foursquare. They were, in my opinion, the first product to gain traction by moving past simple location and building an experience on top of it. It&#8217;s as if co-foundersÂ\\xa0Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai said, &#8220;Okay, we have location, but that&#8217;s boring. Let&#8217;s make a game out of going out with our friends!&#8221; In other words, they worked under the assumption of having location and built a compelling experience from there.I think people who are building location-based applications need to keep two things in mind:1. If there&#8217;s any war brewing, it&#8217;s over presence. That is the very basic question of where you and your friends are and who may know those details. Gowalla, Foursquare, Loopt, et al, if they wish to own presence, will be duking it out with Twitter and Facebook. For anyone who&#8217;s not already in this game it&#8217;s going to be very hard to break into it at this point.2. You need to move past the mindset that location is the feature. Build products under the assumption that you have a user&#8217;s location and that you can use the social plumbing we&#8217;ve been building for the last nine years. What kind of interesting experiences can you build on top of the potent mixture of friends, location, and the real world?So who&#8217;s going to win? More than just one company. The users are going to get more interesting and compelling experiences, some familiar names will revolutionize their products with location, and some kid in a garage we haven&#8217;t heard of is about to make us all look like fools.I can&#8217;t wait.[photo: flickr/bogenfreund]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There are only two weeks left until the iPad&#8217;s April 3 launch date, and Apple has just started reaching out to developers to say that they&#8217;re accepting applications that were developed specifically for the device.   We&#8217;ve included the Email below.  The key takeaway: If you&#8217;re looking to have your app available at launch, you need to submit it by March 27, at which point Apple&#8217;s team will let you know if your application is ready for the grand opening.The first few weeks after the iPad is released will be a huge gold rush opportunity, as users look to try out the device&#8217;s large screen for the first time.  In short, if you can make it to one of the App Store&#8217;s &#8216;top apps&#8217; lists, you&#8217;ll likely do very well for yourself.  The only problem is that the vast majority of developers have never had access to an actual iPad â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0they&#8217;re all working off of emulators, save for a handful of extremely lucky developers who literally have their iPads chained to a desk.  Developers can tweak their applications all they want on their computer monitors, but until they&#8217;ve actually gotten to try it out for themselves, they&#8217;ll have a hard time figuring out if their apps feel right.I expect most developers will scramble to submit what they have by March 27, and that we&#8217;ll then see numerous updates immediately afterward as developers tweak button placement and other interface elements. Some developers may choose to simply wait until they have a device in their hands so that they can try out their apps before submitting, but the App Store&#8217;s discoverability issues make this a risky move (of course, given the hundreds or thousands of applications that will launch alongside the iPad, there&#8217;s no guarantee that you&#8217;ll get noticed on launch day, either).Keep in mind that users will also be able to use scaled-up versions of iPhone applications on their iPads.

       "  'comments_content': 'While every man and his dog is waiting for their preordered iPad to arrive, some Germans went their own way and yesterday presented a Slate that appears to have, well, better features. The Neofonie WePad has similar form and function as the wet dreams of our Crunchgear editors, but facts are that the German Android device has a  bigger multitouch screen and a faster CPU than the iPad.  Also it runs Flash, has USB ports, an inbuilt card reader and expandable memory. Additionally it allows complete multitasking and has a webcam. Beat that baby.The WePad is set to arrive sooner to German stores than its Apple counterpart and will be significantly cheaper than the iPad, says Neofonie CEO Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen. Preorders and deliveries are planned for next month and that&#8217;s no April Fool&#8217;s joke, he insisted in a small chat on the WePad&#8217;s Facebook site. At first I thought it was a fake, because some specs  feel too great and the choice of OS sounds just weird: a Linux derivate with Android on top. That&#8217;s Linux with Linux inside, which makes it possible to install apps from the Android Market as well as special Adobe Air software from Neofonie.&nbsp;WePadiPadDisplay11.6-inch (1,366 x 768 pixels) 9.7-inch (1,024 x 768 pixels) Processor1,66 GHz Intel Atom N450 Pineview-M1,0 GHz Apple A4Memory16 GB NAND Flash (optional 32 GB internal + 32 GB SDcard)16 / 32 / 64 GBWebcam1,3 MegapixelNonePorts2 USB ports, card reader, audio out, SIM card slot, multi pin connectorApple connector for camera or card reader as peripheralsFlash / Adobe AIRYes / YesNo / NoApp StoreWePad AppStore + Google Android Marketplace iTunes App StoreMultitaskingYes Restricted, allowed only for Apple appsBattery life 6 hours10 hours eBook format All open standardsProprietary Apple format from iBooks store Wireless connectBluetooth 2.1, WiFi N, 3G optionalBluetooth 2.1 + EDR, WiFi N, 3G optionalBodyMagnesium-AluminiumAluminiumSize288 x 190 x 13 mm242.8 x 189.7 x 13,4 mmWeight800 g (850 g with 3G)680 gThe company from Berlin, although unknown, is no newcomer. The 12 years old Neofonie GmbH is a software company that also runs a search enginge called WeFind and sells an epublishing platform by the name of WeMagazine. It makes newspapers and magazines readable on computers and smartphones, and that&#8217;s also where they see the real business for their WePad tablet PC.The WePad provides elderly users in the core target group of newspaper and magazine publishing houses, who generally have little to no experience with PCs with intuitive and fast access to the digital world of their children and grandchildren (Internet, e-mail, social media, etc.).For publishing houses, every reader gained with the WePad represents a direct and long-term customer relationship, the foundation for paid content, extensive customer knowledge and new forms of customer communication. While platforms like Apple iTunes and Amazon Kindle force publishing houses into the role of a simply a content supplier, the WePad allows publishing houses to retain access to and knowledge of their audience.So the WePad doesn&#8217;t want to do away only with Apple&#8217;s iPad but also  with the Amazon Kindle, reveals the latest factsheet. That&#8217;s a tall order. Publishing houses should acquire the device and brand it with their own labels to &#8220;move traditional print readers into the digital world in a targeted manner. Print brands can then become online brands, thus minimising the contact with established Internet players like Google Amazon and Apple.&#8221; First commenters do already suspect an alliance between the WePad and Germany&#8217;s biggest publisher, Springer, which is also based in Berlin. The many screenshots with Springer&#8217;s Hamburger Abendblatt on the WePad would be a hint. Springer is the strongest proponent of paid content in Europe. Since November, the company blocks users with iPhones and Android devices from reading most of their newspapers&#8217; websites with the phones&#8217; browsers. Instead they shall buy the apps for newspapers like Europe&#8217;s biggest daily, BILD, or Springer&#8217;s B.Z. Maybe we just saw the birth of a German newspaper tablet. A working prototype was on show at the world&#8217;s largest computer expo, CeBIT, two weeks ago.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last year, OneRiot ventured into the advertising world with RiotWise, an ad format which places content in an emphasized position in their realtime feed. The search engine also launched a pilot program of RiotWise Trending Ads, a stream of ads that correspond to trending topics as they emerge across the social web, that has since been integrated into the search engine&#8217;s API. Today, the realtime search startup is improving upon its advertising product by offering Trending Ad unit that automatically updates in realtime corresponding to the the most popular trending topics at the time. The ability to update in realtime allows OneRiot to show advertiser content that is relevant to trending topics as they emerge on networks like Twitter, Facebook and the web. The ads are available via standard-size IAB Ad Units and  is enabled by OneRiotâ\\x80\\x99s realtime search technology and PulseRank relevancy algorithm. And previously, OneRiotâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cTrending Adsâ\\x80\\x9d were available only via OneRiotâ\\x80\\x99s API. This meant that developers had to integrate the raw feed into their applications, and create their own UI. The new ad unit allows any website currently monetizing with standard static ad units to display RiotWise Trending Ads.In order to implement he new ad unit, publishers need to integrate Trending Ad Units in the same way they would call standard ad units. The ads will then link to realtime and relevant content from OneRiotâ\\x80\\x99s network of media partners. One Riot claims that the realtime relevance of the ads leads to click through rates at four times the average rates.Currently OneRiotâ\\x80\\x99s trending ads have been used on Twitter apps (Ã\\x9cberTwitter) and desktop clients (Digsby).  OneRiot shares revenue with the application developer. As we&#8217;ve written in the past, OneRiot runs the risk of surfacing irrelevant or spammy content with realtime ads, especially is the ads are refreshing constantly to match trending topics. But as a realtime search engine, OneRiot has invested heavily in spam prevention and is constantly sorting through millions of pieces of content to determine what is relevant and what isnâ\\x80\\x99t. Regardless, it seems like a viable monetization tool for developers. The startup, which just raised $7 million in funding, has been steadily innovating its product and is gathering up partners quickly. The realtime stream ramped up this year with all the big players adding functionality to their search offerings and OneRiot was smart to get in the game early.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google&#8217;s obsession with speed is well-documented.  One of the primary design principles behind its search engine is to return results as fast as possible and strip away anything extra.  But its need for speed goes well beyond search.  All of Google&#8217;s apps are optimized for speed (well, except Gmail lately, but they promise to fix that).  The Chrome browser is extremely fast, and the upcoming Chrome OS is also expected to make Web browsing and other computing tasks zippier.  It almost doesn&#8217;t matter if Google&#8217;s Chrome browser and OS gain significant market share or not, as long as they push other browsers and operating systems to keep up in the speed race.  Google&#8217;s need for speed boils down to one very simple thing: money.  It realized long ago that every millisecond improvement in pageload times on its search engine resulted in more searches, and thus more search ads served and clicked on.  The opposite is also true.  Google once did a study showing that delays of 100 to 400 millisecond in showing search results translated into up to 0.6 percent searches.  Multiply that across the billions of searches done on Google and it starts to add up to real money, perhaps tens of millions of dollars per quarter.Google can keep trying to make search faster because that is under its control.  But what about the rest of the Web?  The faster pages load, the more Web pages people will visit overall (this is why broadband adoption is the single biggest driver of Internet traffic and e-commerce).  And it stands to reason that the more Web pages you visit, the more searches you will perform in any given day.  Because searches are driven by the other things you do on the Web.  You go look for information, surf around, and then go back to search when you want to find something new (at least Google hopes you do).  By helping to speed up the Web, Google can speed up that information loop so that instead of waiting for Web pages to load you can get what you need and start another search instead.No wonder Google tries to do everything it can to make the Web faster.  For instance, it is supporting emerging standards such as HTML5 and SPDY, and sharing its best practices and speed-monitoring tools with developers.  It is also baking the PuSH protocol into Google Reader and other apps. In doing so, Google is helping to deliver news feeds faster (PuSH, aka Pubsubhubbub, was created by two Google engineers, of course, and released as an open-source project).  The list goes on and on.It is all about trying to get people to achieve a &#8220;flow state&#8221; where they are just clicking from one link to the next and it all happens instantaneously. In order for humans not to notice electronic delays, new information needs to appear in a matter of milliseconds.  Get the whole Web humming like that and we may never leave our monitors.Photo credit: Flickr/ Ana Patricia AlmeldaCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;ve just confirmed that Morten Lund, possibly the quintessential European tech entrepreneur/investor  &#8211; will be keynoting at this year&#8217;s GeeknRolla in London on April 20.An entrepreneur from Copenhagen, Denmark, Lund is a talismanic figure on the European scene. While many tech players in Europe are accused of being too timid, this is a guy who &#8211; like many Silicon Valley players &#8211; bets a lot of chips at once. Indeed, his story reads like a roller-coaster ride in European entrepreneurship.Wikipedia describes Lund as a startup &#8216;ideologist&#8217; and &#8216;visionary&#8217; who has founded or co-invested in more than 40 high-tech start ups in the last decade, most famously Skype. In May 2008 he exited Danish social networking and mobile backup site ZYB to operator Vodafone Europe for around $49m.But it&#8217;s not been plain sailing. Last year he was declared personally bankrupt last year after losing 10M Krona in an investment into a Danish newspaper, which was admittedly debt generated mostly under the previous ownership. At the time he came out with a statement reminiscient of Eric Cantona&#8217;s famous &#8216;trawler&#8217; quote: &#8220;It&#8217;s like superman getting his suit stolen &#8211; I&#8217;m shaken and don&#8217;t really wanna talk about it. I will come back again with full power, i just need to wash my suit.&#8221;At Le Web in 2008 he gave an amazing talk about the highs and lows of being an entrepreneur which impressed several commentators.His appearance at GeeknRolla is quite simply not to be missed.  I will also be taking him to task about his next moves and his involvement in the controversial new startup, Tradeshift. We&#8217;ll be rolling out the rest of our speaker programme  next week. We are looking for speeches which enliven the European startups scene and teach something tangible. You can pitch me your idea on email with the subject line &#8216;GeeknRolla&#8221;. But just saying you&#8217;d like to speak is not enough. You must have a real idea for a subject. Speakers do not get to talk about their company. They must impart real knowledge.If you are a startup in stealth, private beta or early alpha and want to launch at GeeknRolla, then fill out this form.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Ankeena Networks, a Santa Clara, CA-based provider of new media infrastructure solutions, has raised approximately $16 million in new VC funding, according to a regulatory filing (via peHUB). Update: small oversight from the good people at peHUB &#8211; which we didn&#8217;t catch either &#8211; but this isn&#8217;t actually a new round but an amendment filing:The company had reported back in 2008 that it had secured $8.5 million of a $9.4 million Series A round, and this new filing is actually an amendment. The company later announced a $6.5m extension in the summer of 2009, although did not submit an SEC filing.The new report says that the securities were first sold in 2008, and we should have caught it. Our error was due to the fact that the filing was not labeled as an amendment (thatâ\\x80\\x99s just an explanation for our original post, not an excuse).The company&#8217;s total funding stands at roughly $16 million. Apologies for any confusion.No word about who backed the company with this third round of financing, but Ankeena Networks was listed by one of its main business partners, Juniper Networks as one of their investments when they announced their $50 million fund recently, so that&#8217;s one name at least. Ankeena has also secured funding from VC firms Clearstone Venture Partners, Mayfield Fund and Trinity Ventures.Ankeena Networksâ\\x80\\x99 flagship product is a content delivery platform dubbed Media Flow Director, which enables mobile operators and other service providers to take advantage of rising consumer demand for mobile content and other rich media content across mobile devices, PCs and televisions. MFD aims to ensure users receive a smooth viewing experience without buffering or stuttering despite of varying network conditions, regardless of the viewing device, over mobile as well as wire-line broadband networks. Ankeena does this by dynamically detecting the available bandwidth and varying the delivery bit-rate. Ankeena Networks was born under another name, Nokeena, back in 2008. The company was co-founded by CEO Rajan Raghavan, chief strategy and technology officer Prabakar Sundarrajan, chief strategy and technology officer, VP of Engineering Kumar Narayanan and Jaspal Kohli, chief architect, along with Deepak Srinivasan, VP of Business Development. Collectively, this team brings leadership expertise from companies like Akamai/Speedera, Cisco, Citrix/NetScaler, Exodus Communications, HP, IBM, InSilicon/Virtual Chips, Intel, Level 3 Communications, Mirapoint and Yahoo.One to watch closely.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This year&#8217;s MIX 2010 was led by Scott Guthrie, who has emerged from Microsoft&#8217;s rank and file to own just about everything developer-related. Where last year&#8217;s MIX and PDC conferences were spearheaded by Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie, Guthrie&#8217;s keynote appearances focused on the progress Silverlight has made in driving the company&#8217;s 3 Screens and the Cloud approach to the disruptions going on in mobile, television, and the Web OS desktop. I spoke with Scott after his opening day keynote in Las Vegas:Steve Gillmor:  So, we&#8217;re here with Scott Guthrie, who the last time &#8212; well, the first time I saw you was at an offsite with Eric Rudder about 10 years ago.Scott Guthrie:  That was a long time ago.Steve Gillmor:  Yeah, and you were just &#8212; I don&#8217;t even think that &#8212; you were showing the ASP.NET development plug-in, wasn&#8217;t even part of Visual Studio at that point, and now you&#8217;ve basically taken over everything.Scott Guthrie:  Well, maybe not everything, but &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  But, I mean, you know, going from that sort of &#8212; I mean, don&#8217;t you sometimes think about how &#8212; were you aware of what the potential of that particular strategy and that plug-in was at the time?Scott Guthrie:  Well, you know, it&#8217;s been fun &#8212; I mean, it&#8217;s been a fun ride the last couple of years in terms of we&#8217;ve seen as .NET&#8217;s matured, both on the server but also on the client, and with things like Silverlight, and then seeing Visual Studio really evolve the way it has.  You know, where we&#8217;re at today with VS 2010, .NET 4, Silverlight 4, and ASP.NET compared to where we were 10 years ago, it does seem sometimes like a different world.You know, the nice thing, there&#8217;s a lot of continuity over the last 10 years, and so the same code that worked 10 years ago still works today.  To some extent I think we often think of it just sort of how do we fill in the story and how do we kind of continue to open up new opportunities.I think today, especially with what we showed with the Windows Phone 7, you know, I think we got a lot of people excited about the possibilities that are provided with that, and it&#8217;s great that you can use Silverlight and .NET and the same set of skills and the same tools that you already know to target it.You know, I think we wowed a lot of people that &#8212; with not just the, oh, I can use the same APIs for productivity but also the apps we showed I think people, you know, some people commented, you know, I want to reach out and lick them they looked so good.  Hopefully that&#8217;s a testament to kind of what you can build and get people excited about.Steve Gillmor:  Well, the time, the speed of development is one of the things that you were pointing out.  I was particularly impressed, surprisingly so, I must admit, with how Seesmic seemed to be sort of the heart of the demos.  In its showing how you can go, Loic [Le Meur] made an investment in the Windows client, and then backwards leveraged it into the Silverlight client, and then opened up three platforms as a result.  That&#8217;s pretty spectacular I thought.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, I think what we&#8217;re trying to do &#8212; I mean, ultimately what we&#8217;re trying to do is how do we enable developers to be successful on our platform using our tools, and a lot of the focus we&#8217;ve had around Silverlight has been primarily around consumer and then also last year more also in the business space where I think we&#8217;ve reached a tipping point where the value for companies being able to build an app and sell it or be able to make money is suddenly very compelling. And I think both what Loic showed with Seesmic and then I think also the eBay app that was shown, that we&#8217;re really excited about, it was a great example of people are choosing it, because, wow, I can build an experience that my customers love, I can hit multiple devices, it runs on the PC and it can run on the Mac, it can run in the phone, and the user experience isn&#8217;t kind of a lowest common denominator but it&#8217;s kind of a wow experience on all the platforms.You know, I think you&#8217;re going to see more and more developers get excited by that.  If ultimately developers can build cool apps and make money off of them, you tend to get them interested.Steve Gillmor:  Yeah.  I want to go back just for one more second to the original target.  To me it&#8217;s ironic that ASP.NET was basically a runtime that came out of extending &#8212; I may be oversimplifying it here, but I&#8217;m going to try it anyway &#8212; that came out of extending the AJAX model, if you will, which was sort of born out of a desire to try and extend Exchange Web Services or Outlook Web Services and that whole timeframe.  At some point, you and people at that time who were higher up than you were at the time, you&#8217;re pretty high up now, somebody made a decision that this was not just a hack but that this was something that you were going to basically turn the whole OS over to over time.Scott Guthrie:  Well, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, part of what we&#8217;ve tried to do with .NET from the beginning was how can you build kind of this runtime that was multiple languages, that allowed you to build all types of apps, server apps, client apps, mobile apps, and be able to get a rich development tool experience around them, and a lot of the original ASP.NET predated kind of AJAX, but a lot of our kind of focus &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  But it came out of that same sort of point in time where this was almost pre .NET as a matter of fact, wasn&#8217;t it?Scott Guthrie:  Well, ASP itself shipped with .NET for the first time, but we&#8217;ve kind of &#8212; we certainly have been focused on how do you build great apps, and we&#8217;ve tried to be very scenario focused both on the server with ASP.NET and obviously on the client as well, and tried to really work with customers and partners to figure out kind of, okay, what are the unique opportunities, what are the things that you&#8217;d find really compelling.The great thing about an event like MIX is the fact that you get a chance not just to present to people, but more importantly get feedback, and walk the halls &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  What&#8217;s the feedback been?Scott Guthrie:  As far as today it&#8217;s been great.Steve Gillmor:  But specifically.  I mean, what are the things that are interesting to you about the feedback that you&#8217;ve gotten so far?Scott Guthrie:  I think &#8212; I think the thing that&#8217;s been probably the most gratifying to hear this week so far has been just the number of people that have moved from an evaluation phase to an actual I&#8217;m using it phase.  So, it always amazes me when I talk to often enterprise customers, and really before Silverlight 4 we didn&#8217;t target enterprise business apps as our primary audience, and it&#8217;s amazing to hear a large company that sometimes might be conservative in their technology things say, oh, we&#8217;ve moved way past evaluating, we&#8217;re actually &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  But the trusted aspect of the new &#8211;Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, the out of browser capabilities, and the ability to kind of reach outside the sandbox, we&#8217;re just starting to see a lot of companies start to adopt that.  They like the fact that it&#8217;s easy to deploy, they like the capabilities, and it&#8217;s great having people come up to me during the event and say, hey, I want to show you a demo of something I built, and this is not just sort of like a little simple thing, these are big apps that people have built. And I think Loic onstage with Seesmic, that&#8217;s not just a client for listening to Twitter or Facebook.  You know, he&#8217;s built a whole ecosystem around that.And likewise I think the eBay app that&#8217;s going to go live shortly is a great example of a really rich app that is going to be touched by millions of people.So, that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s most gratifying here, and I think it&#8217;s still early, it&#8217;s only been a couple hours since the keynote, but I think the feedback on the phone work that we showed has been phenomenal.Steve Gillmor:  Let&#8217;s pin down a couple things.  I detected a slight messaging, the lack of some words around the phone implementation.  Is that Silverlight 4?Scott Guthrie:  That&#8217;s a good question.  No, it is Silverlight.  So, it isn&#8217;t Silverlight light or Silverlight something else.  It is Silverlight.Steve Gillmor:  Right, well, you said that onstage.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, right now the bits that we ship today have all the features of Silverlight 3, and about half the features of Silverlight 4 are already in it.  So, once Silverlight 4 ships, we&#8217;ll then go ahead and obviously put the rest of the features in.Steve Gillmor:  So, you mean in a month we&#8217;ll see an upgrade to &#8211;Scott Guthrie:  It probably won&#8217;t be in a month but it won&#8217;t be too far off.Steve Gillmor:  But you&#8217;re not really committing to when the phone is going to be shipping anyway, right?Scott Guthrie:  We&#8217;re not right now committing to when the phone ships, but certainly with each update of the phone it will have the most recent version of Silverlight.Steve Gillmor:  And is Silverlight used in the marketplace?Scott Guthrie:  The marketplace app, I&#8217;m not actually sure if it uses Silverlight or not.  You can certainly put Silverlight apps as opposed to XNA apps in the marketplace.  In fact, it&#8217;s the only type of app you can put in the marketplace.In terms of the video we showed, I don&#8217;t know exactly what the marketplace team used to build that, but they might have used Silverlight.  I&#8217;m not 100 percent sure.Certainly some of the applets that are included are built with Silverlight, and pretty much all of the &#8212; every app that we showed today in the keynote, with the exception of the games, was all Silverlight.  So, the Netflix app, the Associated Press app, the diary app, Four Square, Seesmic, Shazam, Major League Soccer, the cannon demo and the Marionette app, those were all built in Silverlight.Steve Gillmor:  So, why is there this sort of fork between XNA and Silverlight?  What&#8217;s that about?Scott Guthrie:  I wouldn&#8217;t have said it &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a fork.  You can use the same language.  XNA is built on .NET.  So, you can use C#, you&#8217;d be able to use VB for both of them.Kind of the UI mechanics of a game, in particular kind of a high performance 3D game, are typically different than what an application has.  It&#8217;s much more about being able to create composite assets and be able to kind of quickly draw them to the screen.  You will see the ability to have apps that use both Silverlight and XNA UI within them in the not-too-distant future.But, yeah, there&#8217;s a huge ecosystem built up around XNA, and likewise around Silverlight, and so we want to make sure both work great.  We typically think it&#8217;s a fairly straightforward decision as to whether you use one or the other.  If you&#8217;re building an app, it&#8217;s Silverlight.  If it&#8217;s a casual game, then, yeah, you could write it in either Silverlight or XNA.Steve Gillmor:  Can you load one into the other?Scott Guthrie:  Not with today&#8217;s build, but that is something that we&#8217;ll enable in the near future.  And so you could have some UI built with Silverlight and some with XNA.Steve Gillmor:  So, for the free apps, development apps that you&#8217;re releasing today, that Expression and Visual Studio, you can build in one and then move it to the other project, right?Scott Guthrie:  Yeah.  So, we announced today that we&#8217;re shipping Visual Studio 2010 for Windows Phone development Express for free, and then also the Expression Blend for phone also for free.  And that&#8217;s not just for today but free forever. And what&#8217;s nice about them is one is more focused on developers, one is more focused on both designers and what we call interactive developers.  They share the same project system.  So, if you create a project in one, you can open the other and vice versa, and you can actually have both tools open and working in the same &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  And they&#8217;ll stay synched?Scott Guthrie:  Yeah.  Yep.Steve Gillmor:  And they don&#8217;t go out of synch in one direction?Scott Guthrie:  No.  You can even have them both in the same source control project, and you can even have them both literally opening the same project at the same time, and just flip between them.  So, they&#8217;ve really been designed to kind of work well together.Yeah, the nice thing is I think people, basically the reactions of the audience were pretty pumped up after seeing my coding demo and then John&#8217;s blend demo, and I think maybe we got credibility immediately after that of like, okay, these are the richest mobile development tools out there, and then be able to announce, oh, by the way, we&#8217;re making them free, I think took a lot of people by surprise.Steve Gillmor:  All right, so that&#8217;s a good lead into this line of questioning.  And you may consult your attorney if you&#8217;d like.I don&#8217;t know if it was actually shown, but I was shown the night before the demo at PDC, I think Brian Goldfarb showed me the ability to be able to create something using the IIS Media Server.  This was the new build of it, or at least it was new at the time, and be able to click a checkbox and be able to send it to the iPhone.It seems to me, based on the fact that you&#8217;ve released these incredible powerful tools, that you have an opportunity to get at the head of the development chain for applications that not only will run on the Windows phone system, but also on the iPhone.  There&#8217;s a fair amount of black helicopter strategy that would have to be discussed in order to figure out how you would get the UI to come over, not just the ability to be able to push video.  But in general, I mean, you showed Netflix, you showed applications that export video.  Does it seem interesting to you to do something &#8212; the analogy would be what Adobe has done in announcing &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve actually shipped anything, but announcing basically a recompiler or a converter for creating Flash apps and then moving them over to the iPhone.  Of course, they have to because Apple won&#8217;t put their runtime &#8212; as far as I know, they won&#8217;t put your runtime on it either on the iPhone.  Is that true, number one?Scott Guthrie:  Well, yeah, there&#8217;s a couple different aspects.  I mean, one is that we showed it at the PDC last November, and that we&#8217;ll ship later this year is the ability for our streaming server to basically stream in a format that the iPhone natively consumes.  So, that means you can build a Web page with a video tag on the iPhone, point it at a URL on our server, and we can automatically &#8212; it&#8217;s called (trans-moxing ?) our Smooth Streaming video format to the one that plays in the Apple player.  So, you can get a very seamless video player right in your Web page.  And if you go to www.iis.net/iphone with your iPhone today you can try it out and actually see it working.And what&#8217;s nice about that is it doesn&#8217;t require any custom software to be installed on the iPhone, it just works out of the box.Steve Gillmor:  It leverages the H.264 codec.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, both the H.264 codec and then also the built-in streaming support that Apple supports.And so, yes, you will definitely see us continue to ship that, and that means that you can encode your streams once, play them on a Mac, a PC, using Silverlight on the desktop, you can play it on an iPhone, and obviously, like we showed in the keynote today, you can play it on a Windows Phone 7 device.We also today shipped Silverlight for Symbian, which is for Nokia-based devices, and so you can also stream that to Nokia phones.Steve Gillmor:  Well, I find that less interesting than other possible ports like Android.Scott Guthrie:  Well, it&#8217;s nice to ship bits.  Those bits are available for download now, so you can use them. In terms of say iPhone specific &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  In terms of like a UI recompiler.Scott Guthrie:  I think it&#8217;s still a little early in the mobile space.  I think one of the things that would be interesting to see, and I think we showed this a lot today, and I think Apple has shown it successfully in the past, is, you know, especially for a consumer device having a UI that performs consistently with a consistent set of metaphors is important.  And I think Joe really demonstrated that in his talks and in the apps that we showed where they look the same, they feel the same, and specifically with something like Windows Phone 7 there&#8217;s just a notion of motion and fluidity that if you look at other phones, you even look at previous versions of Windows Phones in particular, but you look at Android, you look at other devices, they don&#8217;t work that way.Likewise I think the iPhone has been very successful in terms of having a common set of controls and metaphors to program against.  We&#8217;ll have to see whether or not if you have an app that looks different than the rest of that, you can certainly port it, but it would be interesting to see kind of what consumers think about that.  Forget app stores and things like that, but just sort of if it feels out of place, do people care about it?There is a way today on the iPhone to use it in a product called Mono Touch that Novell builds, where you can use .NET for all your logic, and then they support the ability to have &#8212; to use the standard Apple controls and the standard interface &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  Right, which is Miguel [de Icaza]&#8217;s project.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, Miguel&#8217;s project.And so we&#8217;ve seen a lot of customers be very successful with that.  And so certainly with the announcements we&#8217;ve made today you could absolutely reuse the same logic of your app in the iPhone and Windows Mobile Phone 7, and have them different skinned.Right now we don&#8217;t have any plans or anything to announce in terms of Silverlight running on that particular device.  Instead we&#8217;re spending all of our time really focusing &#8212; not all of it but really focusing hard on how do we enable you to build these kind of next generation Windows Phone apps that really take advantage of a lot of the new interface and the hardware acceleration that we showed off.  If other people, you know, like Miguel&#8217;s project, want to be able to enable that kind of portability, that&#8217;s great.Steve Gillmor:  But there wouldn&#8217;t be any kind of plug-in into Visual Studio, which would allow you to take advantage of all the work that you&#8217;ve done in terms of a Silverlight development environment?Scott Guthrie:  Well, we certainly have our plug-in that works for both Windows Phone 7 and Nokia devices.  We don&#8217;t right now have any plug-ins or plans that we&#8217;ve announced in terms of others, but certainly Visual Studio itself is very pluggable, so anyone could build that plug-in.  But right now in terms of what we&#8217;re shipping this week, it&#8217;s focused pretty much on Windows Phone 7.Steve Gillmor:  Forgive me if I&#8217;ve misremembered this, but isn&#8217;t there an Eclipse plug-in as well?Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, there&#8217;s a full Eclipse tooling support for Silverlight that another company has done, and it&#8217;s free.  And I think it works both on the PC and the Mac, and so you get standard &#8212; I think it&#8217;s a design surface, Intellisense and debugging support, all with the Silverlight.So, yeah, certainly we&#8217;re not making any statement around you need to exclusively use VS &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  But why not, since it&#8217;s free and extremely powerful?Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, I&#8217;d love everyone to say I just want to use VS but &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  But it doesn&#8217;t run on the Mac, right?  That&#8217;s only a Windows &#8211;Scott Guthrie:  Correct, yeah.  I mean, Visual Studio today or Visual Studio only works on Windows.Steve Gillmor:  Any plans for Visual Studio built on Silverlight?Scott Guthrie:  No.  No, not right now.  The new VS 2010 is built on WPF, which is sort of Silverlight&#8217;s big brother, so to speak, and shares the same programming model as Silverlight.  And I think we&#8217;re getting really great feedback now on the VS 2010 RC, be shipping that next month.  And so that&#8217;s allowed us to do a lot more within the IDE.  We don&#8217;t have any plans to rebuild VS on top of Silverlight.  You know, we&#8217;re pretty happy with the version we have that works on WPF.The nice thing is because the code between Silverlight and WPF is highly portable, we are able to move features around that way, but in terms of what VS 2010 supports, it&#8217;s a pretty rich app that really takes full advantage of WPF.Steve Gillmor:  Well, at the PDC we had a lunch with Ray and Bob in which someone asked the question about why don&#8217;t you rename WPF, and Ray sort of under his breath said, sure, just call it Silverlight.  And Bob looked at him like, you know, this might be a little soon for that was the kind of expression.  But I think that it speaks to how far &#8212; you call WPF the big brother, but increasingly it&#8217;s difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other begins, and what you really have with Silverlight increasingly is a Web operating system.Scott Guthrie:  It&#8217;s certainly our &#8212; you know, when we first announced Silverlight, kind of the positioning of it and then also just the technical details of it, we&#8217;ve kind of wanted to make sure it wasn&#8217;t different than WPF, it was going to be a subset of WPF, but we wanted to make sure it wasn&#8217;t a different subset.  And each release of both WPF and Silverlight, you know, any new feature we added into Silverlight we made sure was in WPF, and likewise the new features we added in WPF we brought into Silverlight.So, you have definitely seen these kind of technically converge, which is a good thing, and &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  And when you add the phone into the mix, and when you bring those two up, the phone and the Windows and Mac Silverlight versions up to the same code base &#8212; not the same code, but effectively Silverlight 4, as you said, will happen shortly, that&#8217;s going to tend to again start to minimize the differences between and OS that&#8217;s designed for the desktop and the much broader audience that&#8217;s now emerging.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, and I think Loic kind of really &#8212; what he&#8217;s doing with Seesmic is just a great example of that where at the end of the day it really is for developers the two things that get them excited are &#8212; well, three things &#8212; one, can I build it, build a really exciting app that&#8217;s cool.  Two, can I make money from that app, whether it&#8217;s advertising, whether it&#8217;s subscription, whether it&#8217;s purchasing.  And three, how easy or painful is it to build those?I think Seesmic is a great example of they&#8217;re able to build incredibly cool apps really, really fast, reuse the code across multiple devices, and ultimately are going to be able to monetize that really well.So, I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot more success stories like Seesmic that we&#8217;re going to be able to point to in the months and years ahead.  You know what&#8217;s great about attending MIX is you start to hear about these stories, you know, some big, some small, and it&#8217;s fun to see.Steve Gillmor:  All right, so last question.  If you had some time with Steve, and I&#8217;m sure you do from time to time, Steve Ballmer, what would you say to them about what&#8217;s gone right here, and how that might affect decisions made in the future, like, for example, moving toward a version of Office on Silverlight, et cetera?Scott Guthrie:  Well, I think the things that we showed today, you know, I think the thing that when you step back and look at today, I think what we showed in the keynote, you know, I think we showed to some extent two or three things that were kind of profound.  One was just how kind of how you can marshal a bunch of resources from around the company to really build something that is greater than the sum of the parts in the sense of we showed off Zune integration, we showed off Silverlight integration with dev tools targeting our phone platform, we showed off Xbox integration so that the games could integrate with Xbox avatars and gamer tags and achievement points, we showed off Outlook and e-mail access and calendaring access with a whole bunch of cool features on the phone.  This is all about the phone.And just you go down the litany of the number of scenarios that I think were unique that we were able to kind of connect in a way that consumers really like, and the number of kind of divisions and different groups that we were able to kind of collaborate on to build this kind of experience, and I think that is a &#8212; it might look easy sometimes but getting that many teams all aligned around a common vision and something that consumers really love, you know, I think is a great testament.I think the other thing that I&#8217;d say that I feel like went really well was just people were excited.  You know, the number of people who told me I want that phone, you know, is pretty cool, and I think the work that the Windows Phone team has done over the last year, some of the work that my team has helped with in terms of Silverlight and the tooling from it, you know, it&#8217;s kind of fun to feel like we&#8217;re really pushing the envelope in terms of not just what we&#8217;ve done in the past but more importantly from the phone industry in general.And there&#8217;s still a lot more work to do.  I definitely would not call it done.  But it&#8217;s exciting to be able to ship the tools today and put them in hopefully millions of developers&#8217; hands and see what they build with it, because I think there&#8217;s a lot of power there, there&#8217;s a lot of interconnected scenarios that provide huge opportunities for developers everywhere to light up, and I think consumers are going to love it.Steve Gillmor:  But you didn&#8217;t answer my question about Silverlight Office.Scott Guthrie:  Well, the new version of Office, 14 &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  It uses it a little bit.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, it does use Silverlight, yeah.Steve Gillmor:  Do you think that it would be good to say to Steve, you know, we need to be more aggressive with this?Scott Guthrie:  Well, you know, in general I&#8217;d say I think the most important thing &#8212; and again I think the thing that we showed a little bit today is how do you make sure you&#8217;re consumer focused and scenario focused, because ultimately the things that get people excited, and frankly the things that sell products are if you can demonstrate value and uniqueness and get people excited.  So, you know, I selfishly think, hey, Silverlight lets you do that, and for a variety of cool scenarios. Steve Gillmor:  What would a scenario be around Office?Scott Guthrie:  Well, I mean, I think some of the things that they&#8217;ve done with the Office Web companions in terms of light-up.  You know, there&#8217;s the PowerPoint support or whether it&#8217;s the Word editing support.  Ultimately my mom or my sister doesn&#8217;t really care what it&#8217;s implemented in, but the fact that that app is richer than what she might be able to see somewhere else is compelling.I think likewise today &#8212; you know, Joe I think did a good job.  We kind of went back and forth in rehearsals of how much does he call out the technology.  In his segment he really focused on the user experience.  The user experience, the users don&#8217;t care what it&#8217;s written in, they care that the motion is fluid, the UI is slick, there&#8217;s no jerkiness, it&#8217;s just smooth, crystal clear, polished.Steve Gillmor:  But the impact, the cumulative impact of seeing how those user experiences can be developed with an intuitive tool, that&#8217;s very impressive I would &#8211;Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, and certainly the technology does matter, but the thing I think we&#8217;ve learned, and we&#8217;re going to make sure we stay focused on is, okay, what&#8217;s the end user value, what&#8217;s the scenario that&#8217;s really going to make people go, I want that.  To the extent which, you know, you use Silverlight to do that or you use HTML or you use Win32 or you use COBOL, pick whatever technology &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  Yeah, I&#8217;m going to bet more on the Silverlight than the COBOL.Scott Guthrie:  Yeah, certainly that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re investing, but &#8211;Steve Gillmor:  I want that COBOL phone.  (Laughter.)Scott Guthrie:  That will sell well.But that&#8217;s kind of really where we&#8217;re focusing on is how do we just nail that scenario, and really get people, the end users excited with it, and I think that was the nice thing about the day&#8217;s demos.  You know, people more than just knowing like, ooh, Smooth Streaming is enabled on the phone with Silverlight.  If you showed Netflix, and you say, oh wow, look, here&#8217;s a prototype where I can do instant watch streaming, that&#8217;s cool.  Oh, I can do Four Square.  Okay, I can do that in other platforms, but look, the map is integrated directly within the application, and it&#8217;s all seamless and I don&#8217;t have to navigate.  Or the AP app in terms of gliding through lists of data and seeing the story with photographs in the background and Swivel 3D for the photos.  You know, that&#8217;s the thing that I think gets people excited, and the fact that it&#8217;s really easy to build all those things and that all those apps were built in under three weeks, that&#8217;s the thing that will get the developers here excited, but I think it&#8217;s important to make sure you keep the consumer first in the center whenever you&#8217;re trying to build a client.Steve Gillmor:  Well, you did a nice job of summarizing the keynote today.Scott Guthrie:  I tried, yeah.Steve Gillmor:  Thanks so much for your time.  I appreciate it.Scott Guthrie:  Cool.  Thanks, Steve.[Transcript courtesy Waggener Edstrom]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'TechCrunch50 startup CrowdFlower has been attracting a lot of attention, even raising $5 million in funding recently. CrowdFlower is a labor as a service startup that helps businesses outsource mundane or repetitive tasks to the cloud. Now the startup has attracted a competitor, recently launched CloudCrowd, which also promises increase efficiency and lower costs to companies by breaking large projects into smaller tasks, and distributing them to its virtual workforce.Once a client assigns a task to CloudCrowd, the company will distribute tasks its work force of more than 100,000 workers. With each task completed, a worker earn a credibility rating that determines the types of tasks they are offered.  Workers who don&#8217;t have a rating yet are assigned basic tasks until they develop a reputation. Workers are able to see how much each separate task pays, and earnings are distributed through PayPal. Tasks range from content moderation, internet research, audio and video transcription to data entry. Since the company&#8217;s launch a few months ago, CloudCrowd has completed over 500,000 tasks for a variety of clients, including USC and RentCycle. As I wrote above CloudCrowd will face competition from CrowdFlower, but it seems that the model is attracting the attention of businesses to perform mundane tasks, so there should be room fr several players in the space.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The company was incubated byÂ\\xa0i5invest and  received VC money from AustrianÂ\\xa0Gamma Capital  Partners.Financial terms of the deal have  not been disclosed.It&#8217;s rather obvious that this acquisition makes a  lot of sense for a yellow pages company that makes quite a lot of money from  their online properties. People search is a huge market and 123people&#8217;s  SEO seems also to be a technological asset that&#8217;s of interest for Pages  Jaunes.123people is currently seeing 40 million unique visitors  per month and operates in 11 countries around the globe. The entire team is based in Vienna, Austria.Jean-Pierre Remy, Managing  Director of PagesJaunes Groupe, says he&#8217;s very happy about this acquisition and that it fits perfectly in their online strategy of  people search. He goes on to say that &#8220;with this acquisition,  PagesJaunes Group significantly enhances its global audience, strengthens its expertise in organic search and benefits from synergies between us and 123people&#8217;s sites in France and Spain&#8221;.Russell E.

       "  'comments_content': 'GROU.PS, a do-it-yourself social network focused on moderated online collaboration has unveiled a synchronization tool that allows the group administrators on Yahoo Groups  to sync with GROU.PS.  So Yahoo Groups admins can incorporate functionality such as, location-based services and chat, into their platforms from GROU.PS. The new tool doesn&#8217;t require the Yahoo Group owners to shut down their existing group. They can still continue using their email list. Instead, a GROU.PS group surrounds their old Yahoo Group list and will add additional functionality such as collaboration, deep customization tools and integration with Facebook. GROU.PS will essentially create a whole new social network tailored particularly to that specific list, and augments its functionality with typical social networking features that can be found on any GROU.PS group.And GROU.PS has amped up its offering for publishers by launching Elastic Modules, which gives publishers the ability to change the way the data is displayed to their visitors. To date, the highest reach of look and feel customization was at the template level; thepublisher could only change the skin of their site. Now publishers can actually modify the backend of the social network they&#8217;ve created.The startup&#8217;s networks are attractive to users because it lets you run all of your groupâ\\x80\\x99s collaboration tools from one GROU.PS domain using a single login. The system supports wikis, photos, links, blogs, calendars, chat, forums, maps, profiles, and subgroups &#8211; each of which is available as a plug-and-play module for your community. These modules also allow users to pull in their data from other third party services (flickr, Facebook, Digg, blogs, etc).The startup, which has over 40,000 networks on its platform and 2.5 million users, also added ActivityRank Pipelines, a point and reward system that lets moderators of a social network measure and rank membersâ\\x80\\x99 content contributions and then extend moderation privileges to members based on these rankings. And the social network is launching a subscription model that will allow moderators to charge subscription fees to members (GROU.PS gets a 50% cut on any fees charges).GROU.PS raised $1 million in funding, bringing the startup&#8217;s total funding up to over $2 million. But while the social network is growing, it is still faces major competition form the leader in the space, Ning, which hit 37 million users with 1.6 million social networks in November. \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

Still well below most people&#8217;s radar, the company raised $24 million in venture capital and recently released its first app for the iPhone after nearly a year of development.But that doesn&#8217;t mean the startup has a lack of ambition: they&#8217;ve just hired Gummi Hafsteinsson, who has led several of Google&#8217;s most successful mobile product initiatives as Senior Product Manager for the past 5 years, as their new VP of Product. Hafsteinsson originally joined Google&#8217;s mobile group in July 2005 and first managed the Google Maps for Mobile product. More recently, he led development of Googleâ\\x80\\x99s voice-powered search app for all the major mobile platforms &#8211; iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Symbian. He reported directly to Vic Gundotra, Google&#8217;s VP of Engineering.Prior to joining Google, Gummi founded and ran a company called Dimon Software that produced mobile enterprise connectivity software designed to enable enterprises to access corporate IT systems from any mobile device.His experience in developing scalable applications for multiple platforms tells us Siri is working on making its virtual personal assistant product cross-platform. Its proposition was compelling enough to bring home the award for most innovative Web service at the Microsoft BizSpark Accelerator at SXSW, by the way.In other news, Siri is now available for iPod touch devices, integrated Twitter into the service last week and is closing in on a quarter million early users.(Photo by Peter DaSilva for the New York Times)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A few days ago, we noted that Facebook was testing putting links to QR codes on their main profile pages. Now we know why. Apparently, Facebook is doing some testing ahead of their location feature roll-out, which will use these codes.A source with knowledge of Facebook&#8217;s plans tells us that the QR codes will be used with an upcoming version of Facebook&#8217;s mobile app. More specifically, businesses could potentially print out a QR code and put it on a wall or a counter in their venue to allow users to scan it to check-in at that store, we&#8217;re told. Facebook is expected to unveil its location plans at its f8 conference in late April.For those unfamiliar, a QR code (short for &#8220;quick response&#8221;) is a sort of barcode that stores information which can be captured and interpreted by a mobile device by way of the camera on the device. Google, Microsoft, and others have been experimenting with their usage recently, and now Facebook is hopping on board.But Facebook&#8217;s idea is particularly interesting because it&#8217;s based around the hot check-in space right now. While services such as Foursquare and Gowalla are quickly gaining popularity, both still have under 1 million users, while Facebook has over 400 million users. Recently, the social network has been testing out pulling in data from both of those networks, rather than trying to build its own location network from scratch.That said, with a feature like this, it appears that you could use Facebook to check-in, then perhaps send it back out to someplace like Foursquare. The problem with Gowalla is that their API is currently read-only, so checking-in would have to be done through their own app, and not Facbeook.While the QR code links spotted the other day didn&#8217;t work yet, it was clear that one would link to the actual profile page, while the other would link to a particular status update. It seems that Page owners will get the option to view them soon as well.Facebook&#8217;s location plans continue to unfold.CrunchBase Information',\n",

They&#8217;ve launched a new feature called &#8220;Share my info&#8221; in Yahoo Contacts that is, like the old Plaxo product, a way to subscribe to contact information and have it automatically updated.Instead of updating your friends&#8217; contact information when it changes, your friends just do it for themselves and then everyone with permission to get that information automatically has their address book updated. It saves a lot of hassle and it was brilliant when Plaxo launched it in 2002.But it never really caught on with the masses and most people today are stuck with address books that are little better than they had a decade ago. Plaxo&#8217;s spamming problem probably didn&#8217;t help gain user trust, which was part of the problem. But Plaxo also lacked other features like email to make it a really useful place hold your address book.Syncing products bring the promise of contacts Shangri La, but they never quite seem to work. I still maintain a desktop address book synced with Mobile Me as well as Google Contacts synced with my phone, and it&#8217;s a huge mess of duplicate contacts and outdated information.There&#8217;s also a bunch of independent contact information for some of my friends over on Facebook. And in fact that&#8217;s often the most reliable data for older contacts because they keep it updated themselves. It&#8217;s very similar, in fact, to the Plaxo model. I&#8217;m &#8220;subscribed&#8221; to them via mutual friendship and it can be turned off at any time.I hope Google starts doing this soon as well, simply because that&#8217;s the closest thing to a master contact list that I have in the cloud.  And at some point someone has to solve the problem of syncing contact information and other data across company platforms. Yes, I know a ton of startups have tried this, but no one has quite gotten it dead simple and right.CrunchBase Information',\n",

We&#8217;ve come across a good example.  In Viacom&#8217;s document Statement of Undisputed Facts, it presented the following seemingly damning passage that indicates that YouTube co-founder Steve Chen was advocating pirating movies (a quote that&#8217;s now appearing in quite a few news articles). But Viacom may be misrepresenting the evidence.  Here&#8217;s their version:In a July 29,2005 email about competing video websites, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen wrote to YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, &#8220;steal it!&#8221;, and Chad Hurley responded: &#8220;hmm, steal the movies?&#8221;Steve Chen replÃ¬ed: &#8220;we have to keep in mind that we need to attract traffic. how much traffic will we get from personal videos? remember, the only reason why our traffic surged was due to a video of this type. . . . viral videos will tend to be THOSE type of videos.&#8221;The quote seems to be referring to full-length movies, though viral videos are mentioned (it&#8217;s unclear in this context whether they&#8217;re saying movies will go viral, or if they&#8217;re talking about traditionally more viral video clips).  As it turns out, it&#8217;s the latter.  And they were probably joking about it. Here&#8217;s the actual Email thread, in chronological order:SUBJECT: Re:http://www.filecabi.net/Jul 29, 2005 Â\\xa01:05 AM, Steve Chen wrote:steal it!Jul 29, 2005 1 :25 AM, Chad Hurley wrote:hmm, steal the movies?Jul 29, 2005 1 :33 AM, Steve Chen wrote:haha ya.or something.just something to watch out for. check out their alexa ranking.-s Jul 29, 2005 7:45 AM, Chad Hurley wrote:hmm, i know they are getting a lot of traffic&#8230; but it&#8217;s because they are a stupidvideos.com-type of site. they might make enough money to pay hosing bills, but sites like this and big-boys.com will never go public.

       "  'comments_content': 'There are good things about conferences and there are bad things about conferences. One of the bad things is how little the audience gets to participate directly in the content being created. Sometimes there&#8217;s a question and answer period at the end of a panel where people line up at a microphone to ask questions. But that&#8217;s usually it. Other than booing and applause, and of course the back channel on Twitter, there&#8217;s not much of a feedback loop.That&#8217;s partially a good thing, of course. A room full of 2,000 people all shouting their opinions on a topic isn&#8217;t much of anything except chaos. But sometimes there are people in the audience who have a really interesting perspective on a topic, or even know more about the topic than the people on stage. The idea of an unconference has evolved over the years with Foo Camp and BAR Camp (and others) where the audience and the speakers are one. Those types of events are really rewarding, but they don&#8217;t work on a large scale single track event. Again, it would just be chaos.A couple of years ago Dave Winer had the idea of putting people from the audience, literally, on stage (there&#8217;s a link out there somewhere but I can&#8217;t find it). As far as I know no one has ever really experimented with this yet. But we&#8217;re going to try it out at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York on May 24-26.We&#8217;re going to leave an empty seat on stage for many of the group panels at TechCrunch Disrupt and invite someone from the audience to come up and participate. I&#8217;m not sure how exactly we&#8217;re going to do this yet. We could just ask for a volunteer from the audience right before the panel, for example. But a better way might be to take volunteers for the panels early on in the event and pre-screen them for interestingness, passion for the topic, knowledge, etc.I particularly like the idea of including audience members in the group of experts who judge and comment on new startups launching.I&#8217;m guessing some of the smartest things on stage will be said by these audience members. And it will certainly freshen the format. And I really like the idea of a panel of top experts in a field along with someone who may not have the resume, but certainly has the knowledge and opinions, to be up there too. We&#8217;ll expand the discussion of this on the Disrupt blog over the coming weeks, and announce firmer plans closer to the event.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m hopelessly addicted to Push Notifications on the iPhone. Unfortunately, the system is flawed, in that the more notifications you get, the worse the experience is because it can be hard to manage them all. And one reason I always have the iPhone on me, even when taking around an Android phone, is that there&#8217;s no good way to get my notifications on another device. A new startup may offer a solution for both of those problems.Notifo is a Y Combinator-backed company launching today. While it&#8217;s currently only available as an iPhone app, the plan is to eventually roll out to all the major mobile platforms, starting with Android and BlackBerry soon. And while the current app may seem pretty barebones, the power resides underneath; it&#8217;s a platform.Notifo&#8217;s API makes it very, very simple for any site to insert a few lines of code in their site and offer Push Notifications very quickly. There is no approval process, you simply insert the code and you&#8217;re good to go; your site is now notification-ready.What&#8217;s great about this solution is that it&#8217;s creating a way to get all the notifications in one place, rather than having to manage a dozen (or in my case, more) apps all with their own notifications. This way, when you load up the Notifo app, you get a stream of all the notifications you&#8217;ve chosen to subscribe to. You could get notifications about new TechCrunch posts, or even when someone responds to a comment you made on TechCrunch, for example.The idea is similar to one of my favorite iPhone apps, Boxcar, but again, this is more about the underlying idea of notification syndication. Boxcar is more about setting up and managing notifications across a range of services they choose â\\x80\\x94 and it&#8217;s iPhone-only. Notifo should let you fairly easily set up notifications for just about anything, on any device.While they wait for others to adopt the idea (so far, Listia has), Notifo set up a few services so people can use it with the iPhone right now. For example, Push.ly allows you to get notifications for all Twitter mentions of your name. And there is a simple March Madness final score notifier that has been giving me updates all day as tournament games end, with their final scores. You can also set alerts for when individual stocks hit certain prices.And the service also allows you to send yourself timed alerts, which are easily set up from the Notifo website.Notifo is the work of Chad Etzel, a developer who was formerly doing some work for Twitter.You can find the free app in the App Store here.

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m at the NewsMorphosis Conference in Hawaii today locked in a day of debates about the state of news quality and how the hell we find a business model to keep paying for it. It&#8217;s a big issue locally&#8211; earlier this year three of Hawaii&#8217;s five largest TV news stations merged operations and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin isÂ\\xa0 merging with the other daily paper the Honolulu Advertiser, resulting in plenty of layoffs and general civic concern.So it&#8217;s fitting that the conference ended with a talk by John Temple, the editor of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar&#8217;s new Peer News site, a test case in how the future of local news could work. And thankfully, we finally got a few more details on the site and the approach.Temple was clear to say &#8220;there is no silver bullet&#8221; when it comes to fixing the media business, but also sees a great deal of hope in the volatility&#8211; this from the guy who was head of the now shuttered Rocky Mountain News, a paper that&#8217;s already gone through what so many dailies are dreading.&#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to reinvent a local newspaper and put it on the Web,&#8221; he said. Indeed, the mission of Peer News doesn&#8217;t even contain the words &#8220;news&#8221; or &#8220;media&#8221; or &#8220;paper.&#8221; It&#8217;s simply &#8220;to create a new civic square.&#8221; Core to the development of Peer were three questions:-What is the role of a free press in a democracy?-How would you best fulfill that on a local level using all the tools available today?-How do you do that in a sustainable way?On content, the most interesting thing Temple talked about was doing away with &#8220;articles&#8221; as we know them. He criticized the static, episodic nature by which journalists have traditional covered news, challenging readers to hunt through archives for the information they want. Instead, Peer&#8217;s &#8220;building block&#8221; will be a page that&#8217;s always updated almost like Wikipedia, or as he put it, &#8220;something closer to a living history on a topic that changes as it develops.&#8221; There will no longer be a sense of &#8220;missing&#8221; an article, because the &#8220;articles&#8221; will be living things. That also addresses the critique that local news swarms around one issue, then moves on. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be hot topic driven,&#8221; Temple says. Going back to those questions, Temple says the role of a free press is to inform citizens so they can make intelligent decisions. &#8220;Let&#8217;s stop making it so difficult,&#8221; he said.The other hallmark of Peer&#8217;s approach is what has made blogs popular&#8211; a sense of community. But it&#8217;s certainly a different approach. For one thing, Peer won&#8217;t have &#8220;reporters&#8221; in the classical sense, it will have &#8220;hosts&#8221; who help facilitate this civic square answering questions for the community.Â\\xa0 &#8220;In this era, the fact that newspapers still rewrite press releases is an embarrassment,&#8221; Temple said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be stenographers. I think that&#8217;s a downfall of journalism.&#8221;But for a site that intends to be very community oriented, there was one big shocker: Peer will not have comments. &#8220;(Comments) descend into racism, hate, ugliness and reflect badly on news organizations that have them,&#8221; said Temple. Why? Because people do not have to show their faces when they comment so there&#8217;s no sense of responsibility, he argued. &#8220;We think anonymity is a huge problem when it comes to comments,&#8221; he said.Temple also emphasized that the coverage would not pull punches: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to call things like we see them. We think there&#8217;s real value in taking a stand.&#8221;So what about that business model? As Temple noted, there aren&#8217;t that many business models out there to chose from. Unlike most media sites, this will be a member site that people &#8220;value and will pay for.&#8221; He added &#8220;advertising would not be a key focus for us.&#8221;Peer should be launching early next quarter, so we&#8217;ll be able to see more of these ideas in action soon. But it&#8217;s clear that the site&#8211; or &#8220;news service&#8221; as it prefers to call itself&#8211; is taking a markedly different approach from old and what we consider &#8220;new&#8221; media right now.And with the benefit of some of these details, it seems less out of step for Omidyar to be starting this company. EBay, after all, was one of the first sites to powerfully leverage community on the Web, pioneering a lot of the systems of trust and reputation we still use today.(More on Temple&#8217;s blog here.)',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There has always been a vibrant ecosystem around financial data. Financial institutions, such as hedge funds and investment banks, pay thousands of dollars for quantitative tabular data (financial data in spreadsheets). But now, the web has provided a mechanism to distribute and publish large amounts of data, but much of this data is raw (meaning, it&#8217;s not built into a spreadsheet format) and hard to find in a Google search. An finding the data, and then putting the data into a format that is easy to digest can be a laborious task. Y Combinator&#8217;s Data Marketplace is hoping to change this by providing a platform where financial professionals can request data sets and then data aggregators/consultants can then find and format the appropriate data. Founded by two former analysts at investment banks, Data Marketplace is essentially the middleman in helping financial organizations find quality data on the web. Users can submit requests to Data Marketplace, and the site will send those requests to its database of 200,000 data aggregators, programmers, and consultants who specialize in finding financial data and essentially transferring it into a readable format. Providers then post data resources to Data Marketplace, provide descriptive metadata, and also set a price. The stored metadata is used to help consumers find relevant data through traditional search engines and when browsing Data Marketplace.  Data can also be posted on the site without a request, that users can search for. For example, here&#8217;s a data set of a complete list of Wal-Mart Store Locations, which is priced at $30. Prices range for data, and can be anywhere from $5 to several thousand dollars. Data Marketplace co-founder Matt Hodan tells me he spent $10,000 in on year on data at one of the financial organizations he worked for. Data Marketplace takes a 14% cut of each transaction on the site, from the provider. Data Marketplace handles all of the payment processing and allows users to directly purchase and download resources in an accessible format online.Hodan says that current models for selling and distributing data online are inefficient and expensive for financial organizations. Users only pay for what they need as opposed to plans or buying bundles of information. And providers don&#8217;t have many platforms where they can sell their data in a marketplace. Data Marketplace is similar in some ways to Factual, which is a Wikipedia-like site for open data, and InfoChimps, which takes a more collaborative approach to open data. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Unfortunately, if you visit a site tracked by Google Analytics (and chances are you hit several each day), you have no choice. But soon, you might.Google is testing a browser-based opt-out solution for Google Analytics, they briefly note today on the Google Analytics blog. Specifically, this would be a &#8220;global browser based plug-in to allow users to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics.&#8221; They note that engineers are finalizing and testing the funtionality.How exactly this will work globally across all browsers remains to be seen. While Firefox and Chrome allow for easy use of plug-ins, Internet Exploerer and Safari are a bit more complicated. Still, if you&#8217;re a user who really cares about Google not tracking this information about you, it will probably be worth it to you to install this thing.Of course, the other question is what this means for site owners. While it&#8217;s unlikely that a lot of users would install something like this, what if they did?

Along comes Google a year later and files for &#8220;Nexus One.&#8221; Trademark office says no go. I&#8217;m not really surprised at this; it&#8217;s not really their job to determine which is the better or more popular product, but rather whether it is possible for the two trademarks to be mistaken for one another. Oh god! Will you have to scribble out the name of your phone now and write something else?Nah. I mean, Cisco had a legitimate product out there called the iPhone for years, which was actually in use and still being sold when Apple dropped the iBombshell. They buried the hatchet, probably for an undisclosed sum, but nominally so they could &#8220;explore interoperability.&#8221; Whatever that means.

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;re still poring over the hundreds of pages of documents that were just released in the YouTube/Viacom litigation.  One document that offers extensive insight into YouTube&#8217;s early operations is Viacom&#8217;s Statement of Undisputed Facts, which contains quite a few emails from the site&#8217;s three founders: Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim (sometimes referred to as YouTube&#8217;s &#8216;forgotten&#8217; founder).  For what it&#8217;s worth, YouTube dispels the notion that these were really undisputed; a YouTube spokesperson said &#8220;This statement of undisputed facts is a statement of undisputed fiction.&#8221;One of YouTube&#8217;s defenses in this case is that it has virtually no way to tell if a piece of content has been uploaded with the authorization of its owner.  Which is true â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Viacom has even admitted that it requested that YouTube remove many of the videos that its own personnel had uploaded.  Because of the DMCA, YouTube was allowed to keep this potentially infringing content online provided it responded in a timely manner to takedown requests.But these Emails, at least as presented by Viacom, don&#8217;t make it sound like YouTube&#8217;s founders and employees were necessarily worried about depriving content owners of videos they may have rightfully uploaded.  Sometimes, it sounds like they&#8217;re pretty sure that they weren&#8217;t authorized, and were just relying on the fact that they didn&#8217;t have to do anything until they received a takedown notice.  Instead, they were worried about prematurely cutting off the bulk of their traffic.There&#8217;s some talk of creating the perception that YouTube was concerned with patrolling such content. In one memorandum, Jawed Karim told YouTube&#8217;s Board of Directors that the 10-minute length restriction the site was imposing would &#8220;reinforce the official line that YouTube is not in the business of hosting full-length television shows&#8221;, but that it &#8220;probably won&#8217;t cut down the actual amount of illegal content uploaded&#8221; because users could easily split shows in half or upload the &#8220;Juiciest bits of television shows&#8221;.  Which begs the question, what was the point? Also, note that he refers to it as &#8220;the official line&#8221;.Of course, YouTube says this is all &#8220;undisputed fiction&#8221;, and they&#8217;ll probably argue that the quotes were taken out of context (and they may well have been). If YouTube did follow the DMCA to the letter of the law (regardless of their underlying motivation), they may not have much bearing on the case. Â\\xa0And there&#8217;s also the fact that Viacom is being hypocritical with all of this, because it too offered user-generated video sites that relied on the DMCA, and it uploaded many videos to YouTube itself.But it makes for some very interesting reading.Here are from some of those early Emails and IM conversations (you can find the full document here:On July 4,2005, YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley sent an email to YouTube co-foundersSteve Chen and Jawed Karim titled &#8220;budlight commercials,&#8221; stating &#8220;we need to reject thesetoo&#8221;; Steve Chen responded by asking to &#8220;leave these in a bit longer? another week or two can&#8217;t hurt;&#8221; Jawed Karim subsequently stated that he &#8220;added back all 28 bud videos. stupid. . .,&#8221; and Steve Chen replÃ¬ed: &#8220;okay the video they upload, first, regardless of people are going to be telling people about the site, therefore making it viral. they&#8217;re going to drive traffic. second, it adds more content to the site. third, we&#8217;re going to be adding advertisements in the future so this gets them usedÂ\\xa0to it. I&#8217;m asking for a couple more weeks.&#8221;In a July 10, 2005 email to YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen,YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim reported that he had found a &#8220;copyright video&#8221; and stated: &#8220;Ordinarily I&#8217;d say reject it, but I agree with Steve, let&#8217;s ease up on our strict policies for now. So let&#8217;s just leave copyrighted stuff there if it&#8217; s news clips. I still think we should reject some other (C) things tho. . .&#8221;; Chad Hurley replied, &#8220;ok man, save your meal money for some lawsuits!   no really, I guess we&#8217;ll just see what happens.&#8221;In a July 19, 2005 email to YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, YouTube co founder Steve Chen wrote: &#8220;jawed, please stop putting stolen videos on the site. We&#8217;re going to have a tough time defending the fact that we&#8217;re not liable for the copyrighted material on the site because we the co-founders is didn&#8217;t put it up when one of blatantly stealing content from other sites and trying to get everyone to see it.&#8221;In a July 23, 2005 email to YouTube co- founders Steve Chen and Jawed Karim, YouTube cofounder Chad Hurley responded to a YouTube link sent by Jawed Karim by saying: &#8220;if we reject this, we need to reject all the other copyrighted ones. . . . should we just develop a flagging system for a future push?&#8221;; Karim responded: &#8220;I say we reject this one, but not the other ones. This one is totally blatant.&#8221;In an August 9, 2005 email to YouTube co-founders Steve Chen and Jawed Karim, YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley stated: &#8220;we need to start being diligent about rejecting copyrighted/inappropriate content. we are getting serious traffic and attention now, I don&#8217;t want this to be killed by a potentially bad experience of a network exec or someone visiting us. like there is a cnn clip of the shuttle clip on the site today, if the boys from Turner would come to the site, they might be pissed? these guys are the ones that will buy us for big money, so lets make them happy. we can then roll a lot of this work into a flagging system soon.&#8221;On August 10,2005, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim responded to YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley (see SUF i1 (previous para)): &#8220;lets remove stuff like movies/tv shows. lets keep short news clips for now. we can become stricter over time, just not overnight. like the CNN space shuttle clip, I like. we can remove it once we&#8217;re bigger and better known, but for now that clip is fine.&#8221; Steve Chen replied, &#8220;sounds good.&#8221;In response to YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley&#8217;s August 9, 2005 email (see SUF i146) YouTube co-founder Steve Chen stated: &#8220;but we should just keep that stuff on the site. I really don&#8217;t see what wÃ¬1 happen. what? someone from cnn sees it? he happens to be someone with power? he happens to want to take it down right away. he get in touch with cnn legal. 2 weeks later, we get a cease &amp; desist letter. we take the video down&#8221;; Chad Hurley replied: I just don&#8217;t want to create a bad vibe&#8230; and perhaps give the users or the press something bad to write about.&#8221;In a September 1, 2005 email to YouTube co-founder Steve Chen and all YouTubeemployees, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim stated, &#8220;well, we SHOULD take down any: 1)movies 2) TV shows. we should KEEP: 1)news clips 2) comedy clips (Conan, Leno, etc) 3) music videos. In the future, I&#8217;d also reject these last three but not yet.&#8221;On September 2,2005, in response to an email from YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley reporting that he had taken down clips of the TV show &#8220;Family Guy,&#8221; YouTube co-founder Steve Chen stated: &#8220;should we just assume that a user uploading content really owns the content and is agreeing to all the terms of use? so we don&#8217;t take down anything other than obscene stuff?&#8221;In a September 3,2005 email responding to YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley&#8217;s concernthat &#8220;the site is starting to get out of control with copyrighted material&#8221; (see SUF i154),YouTube co-founder Steve Chen stated to the other two YouTube co- founders that, &#8220;what&#8217;sthe difference between big-boys/stupidvideos vs youtube? . . . if you look at the top videoson the site, it&#8217;s all from this type of content. in a way, if you remove the potentialcopyright infringements, wouldn&#8217;t you still say these are &#8216;personal&#8217; videos? if you define&#8216;personal&#8217; to be videos on your personal harddrive that you want to upload and share withpeople? anyway, if site traffic and viralÃ¬ty will drop to maybe what it is. . . i&#8217;d hate to prematurely 20% of attack a problem and end up just losing growth due to it.&#8221;In response (see SUF i155), YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim wrote: &#8220;well I&#8217;d just remove the obviously copyright infringing stuff. movies and tv shows, I&#8217;d get rid of. . . .leave music videos, news clips, and clips we&#8217;ll of comedy shows for now. I think thats a pretty good policy for now, no?&#8221;In a September 3,2005 email to the two other YouTube co- founders, YouTube co-founderSteve Chen responded to Jawed Karim&#8217;s suggestion that YouTube remove &#8220;obviously copyright infringing stuff&#8217; (see SUF i156) by stating that &#8220;i know that if (we  remove all that content. we go from 100,000 views a day down to about 20,000 views or maybe even lower. the copyright infringement stuff. i mean, we can presumably claim that we don&#8217;t know who owns the rights to that video and by uploading, the user is claiming they own that video. we&#8217;re protected by DMCA for that.we&#8217;ll take it down if\\twe get a &#8216;cease and desist&#8221;&#8216;; Jawed Karim replied: &#8220;my suggested polÃ¬cy is really lax though. . . . if\\twe keep that polÃ¬cy I don&#8217;t think our views will decrease at alL. &#8220;In a September 4, 2005 email to YouTube co- founder Jawed Karim and others at YouTube, a YouTube user stated: &#8220;Jawed &#8211; You have a lot of people posting Chappelle Show clips and stuff like that. Aren&#8217;t you guys worried that someone might sue you for copywrite(sic J violation like Napster?&#8221;; Karim replÃ¬ed: &#8220;ahaha.&#8221;In a September 7, 2005 email, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen wrote to YouTube cofounders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, and Roelof Botha of Sequoia Capital (and later aYouTube board member) that YouTube had &#8220;implemented a flagging system so you can flag a video as being inappropriate or copyrighted. That way, the perception is that we are concerned about this type of material and we&#8217;re actively monitoring it. The actual removal of this content will be in varying degrees. We may want to keep some of the borderline content on the site but just remove it from the browse/search pages. that way, you can&#8217;t find the content easily. Again, similar to Flickr, . . . you can find truckloads of adult and copyrighted content. It&#8217;s just that you can&#8217;t stumble upon it, you have to be actively searching for it.&#8221;In a January 25,2006 instant message exchange, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen(IM user name tunawarrior) told his colleague YouTube product manager Maryrose Dunton(IM user name maryrosedunton) that he wanted to &#8220;concentrate all of our efforts inbuilding up (YouTube&#8217;sJ numbers as aggressively as we can through whatever tactics, however evil,&#8221; including &#8220;user metrics&#8221; and &#8220;views,&#8221; and &#8220;then 3 months, sell it with 20m views per day and like 2m users or something. . . I think we can sell for somewhere between $250m &#8211; $500m . . . in the next 3 months. . . and there *is* a potential to get to $1 b or something.&#8221;In a February 17,2006 instant message conversation, YouTube systems administrator Bradley Heilbrun (IM user name nurblÃ¬eh) asked YouTube product manager Maryrose Dunton (IM user name maryrosedunton), &#8220;was it me, or was the lawyer thing today a cover- your-ass thing from the company?&#8221; Dunton responded, &#8220;oh totally. . . did you hear what they were saying? it was really hardcore . . . if we even see copyrighted material on the site, as employees we&#8217;re supopsed (sic to report it&#8221;; Heilbrun replied, &#8220;sure, whatever,&#8221; and Dunton said &#8220;I guess the fact that I started like 5 groups based on copyrighted material probably isn&#8217;t so great&#8221;; in response Heilbrun said &#8220;right exactly. . . but it&#8217;s a cover your ass . . . so the board can say we told maryrose not to do this.&#8221;In the same instant message conversation,YouTube product manager Maryrose Dunton(IM user name maryrosedunton) reported the results of a &#8220;lÃ¬ttle exercise&#8221; she performedwherein she &#8220;went through all the most viewed/most discussed/top favorites/top rated to try and figure out what percentage is or has copyrighted materiaL. it was over 70%.&#8221; She added, &#8220;what I meant to say is after I found that 70%, I went and flagged it all for review.&#8221; When deposed, YouTube product manager Maryrose Dunton confirmed in reference to the February 28,2006 instant message exchange with YouTube co-founder Steve Chen (see SUF i195) that she was being sarcastic and did not actually flag any of the copyrighted videos for review.CrunchBase Information',\n",

But all that rage apparently hasn&#8217;t stopped the company from getting lots of investor attention. In addition to landing a bevy of top tier angels and venture capitalists in their first round of financing, we&#8217;ve now heard that Blippy is preparing to close on a new round. August Capital partner David Hornik is leading the round. And the valuation is &#8220;totally absurd&#8221; says one source. Another puts it at $50 million, although that may be a little on the high side. Regardless, that&#8217;s not bad for a site which only launched publicly two months ago. Update: Yet another source says &#8220;high 30s&#8221; on valuation, and we think that&#8217;s about right.Blippy wouldn&#8217;t comment on this story. I reached David Hornik (he seemed to regret having answered the phone). All that he&#8217;d say is that he loves Blippy, but he would neither confirm nor deny an investment.If you&#8217;re not already familiar with it, Blippy is a Twitter-like service where users post everything they purchase. You can hook up your credit cards and various online services (Amazon, iTunes, Zappos, etc.), and details about everything you buy are posted. You can see my account here &#8211; I&#8217;ve linked it to my iTunes. See our Blippy launch post for more details.Lots of people love posting and discussing their purchases on Blippy. But lots of other people just hate the idea of the service as an insane invasion of privacy (albeit one that people voluntarily enter into). Read the comments on any of our Blippy posts to see examples of that indignation.Putting all that aside, though, if enough people start using Blippy they are going to be able to monetize the heck out of it. Advertisers will see exactly what users are buying and be able to target them with ridiculous precision. In fact, the data is so deep and rich that Amazon is already threatened by the young startup.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Basically, people who have ideas for mobile applications on any of the major platforms but lack the time, development skills or resources to actually build them can submit their ideas through the Labotec website. The ideas are subsequently evaluated by Labotec, and if one gets thumbs up from a committee of unnamed field experts associated with the company, Labotec funds the entire development, distribution and marketing of the app. The IP is co-owned by whoever submitted the idea &#8211; targeted are carriers and handset manufacturers &#8211; and Labotec.The &#8216;Inspirer&#8217; (the person or organization that brought forward the idea for the app) doesn&#8217;t pay a cent, but if the app ends up generating revenue, the first $25,000 that it makes goes to Labotec &#8211; no matter how long it took to get to that point. After that, the Inspirer gets 50% of any revenue that may follow. Labotec notes that they&#8217;re still testing this model and that it is subject to change in the future.Labotec says that it has received hundreds of new project ideas from 27 countries since its inception in May 2009. A total of 3 applications out of those ideas have launched (iSOS for Android, iMove2Music and FakeSMS for iPhone) and 20 are slated for release by the end of this year &#8211; which basically means a lot of the submitted ideas are junk. The company says it plans to use part of the just-raised capital to hire 10 more developers of mobile apps for platforms such as iPhone, Android, iPad and BlackBerry.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The more people who need to be at that meeting, the harder it is to find a time slot that works with everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s schedule.  A new Google Calendar Labs feature called the Smart Rescheduler brings some search smarts to the problem.  â\\x80\\x9cOvernight, all the Google apps customers will get this,â\\x80\\x9d says Google Calendar product manager Cyrus Mistry.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is like we are giving every employee their own administrative assistant.â\\x80\\x9dThe person scheduling the meeting enters the names of the participants, how long the meeting will be, and a date by when the meeting must take place.  The Smart Rescheduler then goes out and looks at everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s calendar to see when everyone is free, taking into account different time zones and other commitments on their calendars (in order for this to work, all the meeting attendees must share their calendars with Google Calendar).  All too often at this point in the process, someone has a conflict.  What the Rescheduler does is look  at all the soft constraints and actually ranks the best meeting times.  Different attendees can be prioritized so the meeting is set around their schedule.  Soft constraints are taken into account like partial schedule overlaps, times blocked with no other attendees, meetings where someoneâ\\x80\\x99s been invited but hasnâ\\x80\\x99t yet accepted, or meetings organized by that person.  These factors often indicate a schedule that can be altered.Google Calendar throws all of these factors together and comes up with a ranking for the best possible meeting time.  â\\x80\\x9cWe did look at algorithms for search to see how they solved which doc should come to the top,â\\x80\\x9d says Mistry.  â\\x80\\x9cWe discover what meeting should come out on top.â\\x80\\x9d  The Rescheduler can even book new conference rooms based on which one is closest to the original one and the same size.CrunchBase Information',\n",

For instance, in one of the legal briefs unsealed today in the YouTube-Viacom dispute, such as the amount of money YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley made from the $1.65 billion sale of the company to Google in 2006.  His take: $334 million (based on the November, 13, 2006 closing price of Google&#8217;s stock).  In other words, the young CEO owned about 20 percent of YouTube at the time of the sale.YouTube&#8217;s other co-founder Steve Chen&#8217;s stake was worth $301 million at the time of the sale, and the third co-founder Jawed Karim walked away with $66 million.  Even YouTube interface designer Christina Brodbeck &#8220;received Google shares worth $9.09 million.&#8221;The VCs did even better.  Sequoia Capital, YouTube&#8217;s venture backer, turned a $9 million investment into $516 million (or about 31 percent of the total).  And Artis Capital turned a $3 million investment into $85 million.Another notable stat from the legal docs: in the past five years, more than 500 million videos have been uploaded to YouTube overall.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'December 1, 2008. That was the last day I got a Qwitter notification. I don&#8217;t recall qwitting Qwitter, it simply stopped working for me. Until today. When it just puked in my email inbox.For those unaware, Qwitter is a service that emails you every time someone unfollows you on Twitter. It tells you their name, and the last tweet you sent that may have caused the unfollow. Naturally, when I saw the huge influx of emails today, I decided to visit the site again â\\x80\\x94 and guess what, it does appear that they&#8217;re back. As they note, &#8220;We&#8217;re Back! How could we possibly quit catching QWITTERS?!? Fear not&#8230; notification emails have returned, giving us all something to look forward to during the day!&#8220;Not only that, the service promises that &#8220;premium services&#8221; are coming soon. Agora Technology, the group behind the app, promises faster email notifications without ads, and the ability to become a featured Qwitter user if you sign up (more details are coming soon).There&#8217;s just a few problems with the new Qwitter. First, they&#8217;re sending all of these emails with a completely broken link. The &#8220;Visit Qwitter Therapy&#8221; link takes you to the following URL: http://root_url/therapy. Clearly, that&#8217;s the result of some bad coding. And I have about 60 emails today all with the same broken link. More importantly, I&#8217;m not sure the all-important unsubscribe button is working. I clicked on it to unsubscribe earlier, and I&#8217;m still getting the notifications. Others are noting that they qwit Qwitter a long time ago, and have started getting the notifications today.These Qwitter emails are also now promoting TweepML, a Twitter grouping service, which we&#8217;ve covered in the past. And interestingly, it appears that Qwitter may be under new management. Previously it was a group called Contrast that ran the service (here&#8217;s an interview we did with them), now it&#8217;s listed as being run by this Agora Technology group â\\x80\\x94 which is the same group behind TweepML (which just sold).I&#8217;ve never been thrilled by the idea of Qwitter because it adds social pressure to Twitter. Without it, if you unfollow someone, they&#8217;re unlikely to notice (as Twitter won&#8217;t notify them). But with it, they&#8217;ll get an email and things may get, well, awkward. Likewise, getting an email letting you know that you&#8217;ve been unfollowed probably makes you feel a bit uneasy inside. Well, okay, unless it&#8217;s one of the thousands of spammy accounts on Twitter. Still, at one point they cared, and now they don&#8217;t.[photo: Paramount Pictures]',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier today, several previously sealed legal documents in the longstanding copyright infringement lawsuit against YouTube by Viacom were made public.  In conjunction with the public release of those documents, YouTube&#8217;s chief counsel Zahavah Levine wrote a blog post which reads more like a summary of a legal brief.  In it, Levine outlines YouTube&#8217;s main defense against Viacom&#8217;s allegations, including the fact that Viacom &#8220;secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there.&#8221;  Levine also notes that &#8220;Viacom tried repeatedly to buy YouTube,&#8221; suggesting that the current $1 billion lawsuit is its attempt to cash in on YouTube years after the fact.  Here is the key passage from the blog post:For years, Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there. It hired no fewer than 18 different marketing agencies to upload its content to the site. It deliberately &#8220;roughed up&#8221; the videos to make them look stolen or leaked. It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses. It even sent employees to Kinko&#8217;s to upload clips from computers that couldn&#8217;t be traced to Viacom. And in an effort to promote its own shows, as a matter of company policy Viacom routinely left up clips from shows that had been uploaded to YouTube by ordinary users. Executives as high up as the president of Comedy Central and the head of MTV Networks felt &#8220;very strongly&#8221; that clips from shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report should remain on YouTube.Viacom&#8217;s efforts to disguise its promotional use of YouTube worked so well that even its own employees could not keep track of everything it was posting or leaving up on the site. As a result, on countless occasions Viacom demanded the removal of clips that it had uploaded to YouTube, only to return later to sheepishly ask for their reinstatement. In fact, some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself.In other words, while Viacom&#8217;s lawyers were issuing takedown notices, its marketers were putting clips up on YouTube to promote Viacom movies and TV shows.  You&#8217;ve got to wonder what the judge will make of that evidence.CrunchBase Information',\n",

One new app that&#8217;s launching today is called tweetBracket, which gives users an extremely easy way to share their picks with their Twitter followers. The application, while basic, is notable because it&#8217;s a preview of the technology being built by a  Y Combinator startup called 140bets.Using tweetBracket is simple. You sign in to Twitter using oAuth, and are presented with a random matchup from today&#8217;s games.  Click the team you think will win, optionally tweet your choice to your followers, and repeat. The game keeps track of your picks throughout the tournament, and prizes are being awarded to the people with the most correct predictions for each round.tweetBracket is built off of the platform that 140bets is currently developing, which makes it easy to build apps around a binary interface (the company has also put together a similar app for American Idol fans called Tweet Idol).  CEO Jason Wilk says that the platform is still early in development, but that eventually it will be used for more real-time interaction (for example, you might keep it open as you watch a game and predict whether or not a player is going to make the free throw he&#8217;s about to take).',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Jack Dorsey&#8217;s Square was unveiled last December as an innovative way to let people quickly and easily accept physical credit card payments from their mobile phone. Since then, Square, which has been in limited beta, has been used in a variety of use cases. E.g. philanthopic organization charity:water recently used Square at the SXSW festival to collect donations. A local flower cart in San Francisco is using Square to take payments from customers. Denim, a jeans store in New York is using Square to take payments from shoppers. We even used Square at this year&#8217;s Crunchies to raise money for the UCSF Foundation.Here&#8217;s how Square works: A small device attaches to the phone via the headset/microphone jack. The device gets the power it needs to send data to the phone from the swipe of the card, and sends the information over the microphone connection. The device is compatible with both the iPhone and Android. It&#8217;s similar in some ways to PayPal, but anyone can now accept physical credit card payments, too. With no contracts or monthly fees. People are sent receipts by text and email. If you haven&#8217;t seen Square in action, check out this video.And now, a new use case has popped up for Square: political fundraising. Square is currently being used in two campaigns. Silicon Valley VC Josh Becker, who is running for state assembly in California&#8217;s 21st district, has been using Square at fundraising events. And lawyer Reshma Saujani, who is running for Congress in New York&#8217;s 14th district, is using Square at campaign fundraising events, including at an event in San Francisco on Friday. Square is ideal for taking money at political fundraisers for several reasons. Currently, if you want to donate money at a fundraising event, you often have to fill out a form and hand over a check or cash at the event. If you don&#8217;t have your checkbook or cash handy (which, many of us don&#8217;t), credit cards are the only option. You can write down your credit card number and info for fundraisers to charge at a later date, but you have to trust that the fundraiser keeps track of that information and paper. With Square, there is both a convenience added for both the payee and fundraiser. The donation is instantly processed, and Square will send the receipt via SMS or email to the payee. Of course, political contributions and donations are a little more complicated because of the reporting requirements associated with donations. For many types of donations, you need to take the donator&#8217;s name, occupation, address, and other information. Currently Square doesn&#8217;t allow users to input all of this information but Dorsey says that they are releasing Square&#8217;s API to allow fundraisers to build additional applications on top of Square, where they could input all of the necessary data. Once this is enabled, Square will allows fundraisers to eliminate paper collection and payments all together.Dorsey says he&#8217;s already getting significant interest from politicians and political candidates across the country, but because Square is in limited beta, is being selective about how the service is distributed. Dorsey expects Square to be open to the public sometime in the next few months. Valued at $40 million even before launch, Square is off to an impressive start. And technology&#8217;s most notable investors and leaders seem to think so as well. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, investor Ron Conway, Googleâ\\x80\\x99s Marissa Mayer, Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley, Digg creator Kevin Rose, investor Esther Dyson and a host of others have invested in Square. The company also raised funding from Khosla Ventures. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Stealth startup Trada launched to the public today as an online marketplace allowing small and medium businesses and agencies to essentially crowdsource search engine marketing services. The startup has raised $2.2 million from the Foundry Group and angel investors Alan Warms, Carlos Cashman, Dan Murray, James Crouthamel, Stuart Larkins and Robert Wolfe. As we all know, search advertising is necessary for businesses but SEM can be a time consuming, perplexing and tedious task. Many businesses overpay for common keywords or don&#8217;t use the right keywords to drive traffic. Trada comes into play here by crowdsourcing SEM experts to build and manage and advertiser or business&#8217; paid search campaign across search engines. The service currently supports Google AdWords and Yahoo Search Marketing. Essentially, Trada ends up being a middleman for coordinating SEM service. Advertisers use Trada to enter information about a campaign and experts, who must be AdWords or SEMPO certified and pass Trada certification, use the site to find interesting campaigns and submit keywords, ad copy and bid prices across the search engines and to track and optimize campaigns across the ad networks. Trada coordinates the payments and takes a small cut of each transaction between advertisers and SEO experts. The benefit for the SEM experts is that they don&#8217;t have to deal with the administrative and management issues with clients. Experts earn money when they generate clicks or other actions for less than the advertiserâ\\x80\\x99s target price. Advertisers get 25 qualified experts to work on their campaigns and according to Trada, those businesses who participated in the private beta of the service are seeing successful results.  Trada entered private beta in January 2009 and currently has 70 advertisers and 280 experts to date. Founded by entrepreneur Niel Robertson, Trada was born after Robertson grew frustrated managing his own $8,000-a-month paid search campaign. Realizing that paid search campaigns are best left to experts, he thought an online marketplace for PPC experts and businesses would be the best way to maximize SEM. The startup faces competition from Kenshoo, Conductor and many others. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'For the past couple of years now, when talking about the Apple TV product, Apple likes to throw out the word &#8220;hobby.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if they&#8217;re ashamed of the device. And considering sales are anemic next to Macs, iPods, and iPhones, it&#8217;s no big surprise that they talk this way.But there&#8217;s actually nothing to be ashamed of. The Apple TV is a good product. Apple just needs to put some proper time and energy into it, to expand it to its full potential. And news today about the so-called &#8220;Google TV&#8221; should do just the trick.Apple and Google are on the verge of war. The formerly close allies are increasingly competing in key spaces for both, and the living room is likely to be a new battleground because it&#8217;s still very much up in air. As the New York Times reported yesterday, Google is working with partners including Intel, Sony, and Logitech to bring a Google TV experience into the living room. This is, of course, where the Apple TV resides. And Apple would be foolish to simply cede any ground it does have to its new favorite rival just because it&#8217;s focused on other things (*cough* iPad *cough*).That&#8217;s a Microsoft move.As Nick Bilton points out, this Google TV would be based around the Android platform. This means that the key idea is likely to have third-party developers work on it to make applications built for a television set. That&#8217;s easier said than done, but Android&#8217;s open nature should yield some interesting results rather quickly.Apple, meanwhile, is of course anything but open with regard to their devices. In fact, the Apple TV is entirely closed right now, as only Apple is able to modify its software (without hacking it, of course). I suspect that will change, following this revelation.The idea of running iPhone-style applications on the Apple TV has long been a sexy one. Hell, people have even ported apps over to a TV screen to show how well it could work. The main problem with developing iPhone apps for the Apple TV seems to be resolution. With the iPhone (and iPod touch), Apple offers only one screen size/resolution, ensuring developers have an easy time making great-looking apps â\\x80\\x94 while at the same time, making sure end users have a great experience.But the iPad has already changed everything. With their new device, Apple has kept things as simple as possible by making iPhone apps scale up two times to work on the bigger display, but it&#8217;s still shows a willingness to move beyond the one screen size. Unfortunately, with the Apple TV, it can be attached to a screen that could be a huge variety of sizes, so it would be hard to control that.Google doesn&#8217;t care about that because Android already runs on dozens of phones with different screen sizes. But Apple clearly cares about how apps look on its devices (so much so that the iPad itself was likely designed at a strange ratio simply to make scaling apps look as good as possible). So does that mean they start offering an actual Apple TV (as in a screen)? Rumors of that have been around for a long time. Or maybe they black-box apps to a certain resolution â\\x80\\x94 similar to what they&#8217;re doing on the iPad when an app isn&#8217;t scaled up?Who knows. But what I do know is that upon hearing this Google TV news, the Apple TV became a little less of a &#8220;hobby&#8221; yesterday.Aside from calling it a hobby, Steve Jobs has referred to the Apple TV as being a potential &#8220;fourth leg&#8221; of a chair Apple is building. Leg one is the Mac, leg two is the iPod, leg three is the iPhone, and Jobs had hoped the Apple TV would complete the chair one day. But it seems clear now that he thinks the iPad could be the fourth leg instead.Screw that. I think it&#8217;s time for Apple to build a whole dining room set of furniture. We, as consumers, need a living room arms race between Apple and Google (and Microsoft, TiVo, Roku, Boxee, and the rest) to kick the cable companies&#8217; shitty television user experience to the curb.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Also participating are U.S. Venture Partners, First Round Capital, and several angels, we&#8217;re told.There are professional translators out there that will convert your site into a different language, but they&#8217;re usually expensive, and it can take a while.

They use a hybrid model which essentially allows you to pick between professional translators, machine translations, and crowdsourced translations. The key is managing it all, which can be done with Smartling&#8217;s software. With it, you can pick and choose which part of your site to translate which way.As the web continues to grow quickly in places such as China, translation is going to be a very important aspect of an increasing number of sites and services.

While a clear winner in the &#8220;Location War&#8221; has yet to be determined, the truth is that many of the location-based services won, as all of them got a huge amount of exposure over the past week. And look for that trend to continue in a big way, as Apple is now highlighting several of them in the App Store.As you can see in the images in this post, Apple is highlighting five of the key location players both in the App Store on iTunes, as well as on the App Store on the iPhone itself. On the iTunes version, the apps have their own area right below the &#8220;New &amp; Noteworthy&#8221; area. On the iPhone, the five apps takes up the top five slots of the &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot&#8221; area. Simply put: This promotion is huge.So what are the five apps? The names should be familiar to you because we&#8217;ve covered each very recently. Foursquare (our coverage), Gowalla (our coverage), Loopt (our coverage), Whrrl 3 (our coverage), and MyTown (our coverage). I&#8217;d like to think Apple picked these guys to feature after reading TechCrunch, but who knows what goes on behind the doors of the secretive company.As any app developer will tell you, having your app featured can make or break it. Even the two most-hyped players, Foursquare and Gowalla (the two key players in the most recent Location War), stand to benefit from Apple&#8217;s ability to reach all kinds of different audiences with the App Store. Foursquare announced earlier that it had gained 100,000 new users in just the past 10 days â\\x80\\x94 that type of growth may actually continue as long as Apple keeps featuring the app.The other three, have all benefited in the past from previous Apple promotions.

Many of the apps die off soon thereafter, but some of them live on.  And now they&#8217;re becoming acquisition targets:Â\\xa0Learn That Name, a game that uses your LinkedIn contacts to help you remember the names of your business acquaintances, has been acquired by Gist. Terms of the deal aren&#8217;t being disclosed, but the LTN guys say they&#8217;re &#8220;very, very happy&#8221; with the result.Learn That Name was built last August at a Microsoft-sponsoredÂ\\xa0Startup Weekend and won top prize (which was amusing, because it was built for the decidedly non-Microsoft iPhone). The app&#8217;s idea came from lawyer Eric Koester, who was inspired to create it after he failed to remember someone&#8217;s name earlier during the event.  A team of 14 people came together to build the app that weekend, and since then, a subset of the original LTN team has continued working on it, releasing an updated iPhone version, Palm WebOS app, and Flash app.The deal is for LTN&#8217;sÂ\\xa0tech assets, and the proceeds are being split among the 14 original team members. Going forward, the standalone iPhone and Palm applications will still be available, and the game is also integrated into Gist&#8217;s own iPhone application, which you can find here. Â\\xa0The Gist version will tap into Gist&#8217;s database of contacts (the original uses LinkedIn).For those that haven&#8217;t used it, Gist offers services that help you keep tabs on the people in your professional network.  The service&#8217;s web interface allows you to see past messages and attachments from each contact, news about their company, and their recent messages on services like Twitter.  Gist also offers an Outlook plugin that shares similarities with Xobni.  Given the business orientedÂ\\xa0nature of Learn That Name, this seems like a good (and fun) fit.  Given the success of the Learn That Name team, it will be interesting to see if more Startup Weekend teams continue working together following the conclusion of their events.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers partner John Doerr, perhaps the most celebrated venture capitalist and certainly one of the most successful, will leave the Amazon board of directors this year. Venture capitalists often try to stay on public company boards well after their investments have run their course. It&#8217;s a status thing, but it also puts them in a terrific position to help their younger portfolio companies. There&#8217;s no reason for Doerr to step down from the Amazon board of directors based on time commitments, which is what Amazon is saying. There&#8217;s just too much upside to being on the Amazon board of directors. And Doerr remains on other boards, including Google.So what is the reason? Our guess is that Doerr is leaving the Amazon board for the same reason Google CEO Eric Schmidt left the Apple board of directors in 2009. Competition and conflicts of interest.Google is increasingly competitive with Apple. But the company also competes with Amazon in a number of areas, particularly web services and big data. And down the road, Google may compete directly in other ways as well. Froogle was a flop, but don&#8217;t think Google doesn&#8217;t want a bigger chunk of ecommerce revenue from people who begin their product searches on their search engine. We&#8217;re betting Doerr had to choose between the two companies.Or maybe Doerr just got sick of flying up to Seattle for the board meetings.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Zillow&#8217;s Android app has similar functionality to the iPhone app. The Android app uses GPS technology to find and follow users on an aerial map, and displays values, homes for sale, homes for rent, listings and recently-sold data on the homes around their local area.

You speak the address, neighborhood, zip code or city into the phone and the app will instantly take the user to the location on the map. And the app leverages Google Street View by displaying curbside images of homes and streets. Each listing features the same details as the listing on the web, with multiple photos, home details, and contact information on homes for sale or for rent. Users can also filter their home searches by sale price, rental price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and listing type (for sale, for rent, and recently sold).Zillow, which launched as a mortgage marketplace in 2008, recently added rentals to its business, opening up the site to a new market in the wake of the burst of the real estate bubble.

       "  'comments_content': 'Fwix,  a startup that offers a stream of local news thatâ\\x80\\x99s updated in real-time, has landed a deal with The New York Times Company to use Fwix&#8217;s  hyper-local news wire across The New York Times Companyâ\\x80\\x99s Regional Media Group&#8217;s 15 newspapers, as well as other business units such as Boston.com and NYTimes.com.  Fwix, which launched its realtime API a few weeks ago, aggregates news articles and blog posts that are relevant to a certain region (the site now features support for over 80 cities in the United States and Canada). To do this, the Fwix team selects news sources and blogs that it thinks are related to each city, and also uses automated algorithms to determine when other content might also be relevant. Fwix has also recently tweaked its algorithm and offerings to include &#8220;nearby&#8221; local content features. So content on Fwix displays relationships between both topics and nearby location. For example, after reading a story about a robbery that took place in the Mission district of San Francisco, you&#8217;ll be able to find any other crime and or stories about the Mission neighborhood. While its still unknown how Fwix will be implemented across all of the New York Times&#8217; properties, the startup&#8217;s local news content is already being used in the publishing company&#8217;s Northern California newspaper, the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat. In the &#8220;YourTown&#8221; section, the Fwix feed is set to a current location and feeds realtime news about the San Francisco Bay area. However in some instances, the Fwix news feed might show the reader his or her own local news by autodetect location via an IP address (say, at a global-reaching site like www.nytimes.com). There is a revenue agreement with The New York Times Company, says Fwix founder and CEO Darian Shirazi, but he declined to reveal the exact amount involved in the deal. And the deal is not exclusive, so Fwix can be incorporated on other news sites as well. Fwix&#8217;s local news stream has also been integrated on integrated on WeatherUnderground.com and UPI.com.  And the startup also launched the Fwix News Publisher app on Facebook, which lets any Facebook Page add local news of any variety of subjects (business, sports, politics, living, entertainment, etc.) to their page&#8217;s feed. The deal with the New York Times is a huge coup for a startup that launched less than two years ago. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Ash Patel, a senior Yahoo exec and one of the company&#8217;s longest serving employees, will shortly be stepping down. His last day will be next Monday.Patel was one of Yahoo&#8217;s first sixty employees, and joined shortly before the company went public in April 1996. There are just six current Yahoo employees who joined before Patel, the company says.His first job at Yahoo was &#8220;technical Yahoo,&#8221; a title given to all engineers. He created the My Yahoo product and also built Yahoo&#8217;s first instant messenger client. He stopped coding for a living in 2002 and has since been in a series of product and engineering executive positions.His current role is EVP Product Architecture &amp; Strategy. He has also served as Chief Product Officer and has run the engineering group at Yahoo.I met with Patel this morning for a little over an hour to talk about his time at the company the early days at Yahoo.One of his favorite moments was summer 1996, he says, when cofounder David Filo would stay up all night watching the news and manually updating results from the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Most updates to Yahoo&#8217;s website were manual in those days, he says, although there were a few partners sending in content in a variety of formats.Patel also talked about how annoyed he would get trying to test Yahoo&#8217;s instant messenger client during the wee hours of the night when no one else was awake. He couldn&#8217;t test new features on his sleeping friends, so he added a feature where a user could add themselves as a friend. That feature is still part of Yahoo Messenger. Says Filo, â\\x80\\x9cDid you know that you can add yourself as a contact in Yahoo! Messenger? Well, you can. Why? Because Ash needed a way to test the code to see if it was actually working the way we wanted it to while Messenger was first in development. He couldnâ\\x80\\x99t wait. He wanted that feedback immediately and he wanted that chance to get things right on the fly. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the kind of ingenuity Ash brought to Yahoo!. He helped us to move faster than we thought we could and to find new ways to look at our work from the userâ\\x80\\x99s point of view.â\\x80\\x9dPatel says Yahoo is in a transition period but is building the infrastructure it needs to compete in the future. Everyone is focused on social right now, he says, and so is Yahoo. But they have product plans for &#8220;what&#8217;s next after that&#8221; as well.I asked Patel about Yahoo&#8217;s current troubles, saying that Yahoo sort of feels like England in 1940, surrounded by the Nazis (I&#8217;m not sure who the nazis are in my analogy, but we met very early this morning and it was the best I could come up with). His response &#8211; &#8220;Well, look who won the Battle of Britain&#8230;Things turned out ok.&#8221;We also had a side discussion about whether Carol Bartz could play the part of Winston Churchill. But like I said, it was early.What&#8217;s next for Patel? He says he&#8217;s going to take a few months off with his family and start to think about the future this summer. He advises a few startups, he says, although he doesn&#8217;t seem to be suggesting, yet at least, that a startup is in his future.One thing is clear &#8211; Patel will be missed. He is a genuinely likable and intelligent guy who&#8217;s seen a lot over the last 14 years. It&#8217;s a loss for Yahoo that he&#8217;s leaving, but this guy clearly will continue to bleed purple.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Nobody is safe in the House of Murdoch, especially on the Internet side of the house.  Yesterday, News Corp&#8217;s online games business, IGN Entertainment, announced layoffs to its staff.  Cuts were pretty even across all parts of the company, and we&#8217;ve been able to learn that about 65 people in total lost their jobs, or roughly 20 percent of staff.Joystiq was the first to get a hold of the layoff memo from president Roy Bahat, who wrote:We are losing colleagues who played an important role getting us to where we are &#8212; #1 in games and men&#8217;s lifestyle, and growing 40% over last year in the total size of our audience. We are deeply grateful to our colleagues for everything they&#8217;ve done. We as a company are absolutely headed in the right direction, and while today will be hard, it won&#8217;t stop us.In other words, don&#8217;t let the door hit you on the way out.  The layoffs at IGN follow larger cutbacks last year at sister site MySpace, which laid off 30 percent of its U.S. staff and two thirds of its international staff last summer.  More recently, MySpace replaced its CEO.Murdoch is definitely not enamored with the Web anymore.CrunchBase Information',\n",

But who&#8217;s actually succeeding and which brands have managed to maintain high download numbers?PositionApp, the app that lets you track how iPhone apps are doing on the App Store rankings, might have the answer. They track and record the top 300 apps across all demographics and have provided us with details on the top 15 apps in the US App Store. Hit the jump for the list.The first two apps, Facebook and Pandora, are clear favorites and there&#8217;s no real surprise there. But then it gets a bit tricky. Somehow, Driver&#8217;s Ed.com and Gibson Learn and Master Guitar are the next two. Though valuable applications (or so it seems), it&#8217;s intriguing that folks like Disney and Comcast are managing to take a back seat to lesser known brands.Of course, there are plenty of high-quality brands on here. Companies like eBay, MySpace, Bank of America and PayPal are all doing quite well, and have managed to sustain their high position for at least 4 weeks.Ultimately, it&#8217;s hard to figure out from this list what exactly makes a branded app successful, though one thing&#8217;s for sure: brands have started to consume the iPhone and pretty much everyone has to have an &#8220;iPhone&#8221; strategy. Success definitely seems indirectly related to providing value, as applications like Facebook / The Weather Channel and Paypal show.So what do you think?

       "  'comments_content': 'Every generation thinks that they are the first. The first to feel this way or that, the first to make this or that revelation, the first to do and make things that we find later have been done and made since before we could record their doing and making. But while these illusory and fleeting firsts are common to every generation, there are true firsts being achieved constantly, though they are often subtle enough that they are not noticed even by those in their midst. My generation has been lucky enough to be part of a very important first.The personal computer (in all its forms) has grown to be, I would say, the single greatest potential source of prosperity in history. It has enabled the internet and a consequent democratization of all sorts of arts and information, as well as the ongoing destabilization of financial institutions via distributed money transfers. The revolution, and it really is one, is ongoing. How unlike the world of 2000, of 1990, is the present day? And 2020 will be doubly, triply removed. As technology further enables itself, the positive feedback creates a greater rate of advance, and thus our acceleration; if this interests you, you should probably go talk to Mr. Kurzweil, since he&#8217;s done a bit more work on the idea. I&#8217;m not concerned with the singularity, however: my object is the generation to which I belong. I propose that this generation, which I am going to call Generation I for a number of reasons, is the only one to which the rate of advancement of technology was exactly fitted. At no other time in history, and perhaps never in the future, will there be a group of people whose own growth and maturation is so perfectly reflected in the principal technological and cultural advancement of the age.It&#8217;s a serious claim, but I hope to show that it&#8217;s founded in observation and not egomania. And let me remark further before I begin, that I am not claiming any special merit for this generation, only a special situation. Lastly: I will speak of &#8220;advancement&#8221; or &#8220;progress&#8221; as if they were objectively measurable, when clearly there is much to be said on what those concepts actually consist of. But for the purposes of this article, let us consider them to be, say, the progressively sophisticated bending of the natural world to our needs and wants.As even a casual student of history (read: a grade-schooler) can see, the rate of technological and cultural advancement has ever accelerated, of course with some interruptions due to warfare and subjugation. This is first observable in the length of &#8220;ages&#8221; &mdash; the stone age, 40,000 years. The bronze age, 2000 years. The iron age, 1000 years. There are too many books written on this topic for me to spend many words on this, and at any rate this acceleration is palpable to those of us living in the modern first world. Moore&#8217;s Law was once a simple prediction; now it&#8217;s practically a force of nature.Let us look at recent history, to prime our minds for the idea of what I would call a &#8220;generational technology.&#8221; The car is a perfect example. Prototyped in the late 19th century, manufactured widely in 1915, increasingly affordable and common over the next 30 years, then producing a &#8220;car culture&#8221; in the 50s and 60s, followed by an increasingly consumerized nature as the automobile was integrated completely into civilization, and cities and lives began to be designed around it. Today the integration is complete, and perhaps we are on the verge of another change, to a post-car world. I don&#8217;t know. But the divisions in the car&#8217;s history, you see, are a lot like generational periods. The specific dates and years aren&#8217;t important, as generations are a sort of rolling concept, and the lines are wherever the historian finds them convenient to be. So let us look at the stages of the car, which I have also given names (I&#8217;m a coining machine today):Hammer stage: During this time, the concept and platform of the automobile were being determined by the founders and inventors. Things like setting down how many wheels a car will have, which method of propulsion it will use, the materials it will be built from, and so on. There was surely some bickering here, as there was between AC and DC when prototyping electrical devices, but one fundamental form is almost always selected, and for the car it was four wheels, front engine, and internal combustion. This stage is performed entirely by an older generation of inventors, investors, and engineers.Paper stage: This is the period where the creators turned the design over to the marketers, who made it into a product. Extra features were created within the confines of the pre-established framework, manufacturing methods were improved, the whole process made faster, and other steps taken to make the technology affordable and attractive. For the car this was of course improvement in reliability, luxury, and speed, among other things. It is a stage of intense competition among marketers, who must both inform and sell to the public, to whom the idea of the car (in, say, 1925-1940) is still new and barely affordable. They are largely ignorant on the subject and are likely skeptical.Tinker stage: Once the car was adopted by consumers at large, as cars were by the close of World War II, the next (very numerous) generation grew up with the &#8220;new&#8221; technology taken &mdash; I don&#8217;t want to say for granted but perhaps as granted. The car culture of the 50s and 60s was a result of a generation of people in tune with an important and exciting technology, a generation as familiar with the car as they were with the clock. There was an expansion of the purposes of the car during this time, as well as a great improvement in their quality, since this generation, having grown up with cars, would work to provide the advancements that were not possible under the auspices of either their parents or the inventors, whose ideas were likely no longer applicable. This positive feedback loop, as in other technologies, leads to a second push and prepares the way for the fourth stage.Mirror stage: Once the car had been proposed, adopted, and grown up alongside of, in the three previous ages respectively, it was ready to become fully integrated. Not just because it had gotten to a certain level of affordability or reliability, but because it was an integral part of the modern person&#8217;s life already, and now the task was to shape civilization around it. While the highway creation act in 1956 obviously wasn&#8217;t driven by 10-year-old baby boomers, the obligation of government and industry to acknowledge the growing importance of the automobile was clear enough once it was recognized at large as foundational. In this stage nearly everyone is part of the process; the automobile has impressed itself on civilization, and civilization must now reflect it more fundamentally. The term Mirror Stage is actually an existing psychological one (as well as an excellent game), and refers to the period at which a child becomes captivated with its own image. I thought it loosely appropriate.Essentially: invention, introduction, internalization, integration.But is there another stage? I don&#8217;t think so. The cycle is complete: the changing world births a new technology, the technology is popularized, refined, and eventually fuels the next change. I chose the car as a representative because it is familiar and its effects clear, but with a little work I think that the model I&#8217;ve just suggested can be applied to pretty much any technology, from aqueducts to longbows. But this isn&#8217;t a longbow blog &mdash; so let&#8217;s move on.Note that, in the example of the car, each stage is relegated roughly to a generation. The inventing generation sells to the adopting generation, which brings up the integrative generation. Furthermore, the inventing generation cannot be the adopting generation, and the rate of progression in this case prohibited the adopting generation from being the integrative generation; for the car it took around 50 or 60 years, arguably more, for it to reach its Mirror stage. My belief is that Generation I (born roughly between 1975 and 1985) is the first generation, and possibly the last, to see and be a part of every stage: to be a part of the genesis, popularization, refinement, and counter-refinement of their age&#8217;s defining technology.Now, I don&#8217;t claim we invented the personal computer; nor, I&#8217;m sure, would those who are cited as inventing the computer. Like the automobile, the computer was a long time coming and was enabled by advances in many other technologies and disciplines. Early computing was as an exercise in logic, mathematics, and electrical engineering, and its early advances academic. What defined the automobile, and what has defined both the computer and the age in which it has proliferated, was not in fact the creators (brilliant though they were), who were the implements of history, but the people who used them and guided their use. For the car, that definition was stretched out over long decades, and people grew old while automobile technology remained young. For the personal computer and the internet, the infancy of the technology coincided with the infancy of my generation, its adolescence with our adolescence, its growth with our growth, in such a pas-de-deux as has no precedent in history and, for all we know, may have no equal in futurity.Generation I is the middle child of the information age. To be born a few years earlier would mean to see the personal computer and the internet as an new and exciting gadget, like the VCR or Walkman. A few years later would be to arrive late to the show: to grow up in the presence of computers, smartphones, and the internet, but not to grow up with them. Taken for granted, these things become black boxes; on the other hand, seen as just another set of devices and applications, they lose their transformational potential. I think the timing is very important, but of course as part of the generation, I am prone to that error.Our readers will probably remember that computers around 1980 were ugly, limited, and expensive machines. They performed a few of the functions will still value today (word processing, calculating, games) but had no GUI and little connectivity. I don&#8217;t want to overstate the parallels, but just for clarity in what I am driving at, consider that an apt comparison might be to a young child, able to see and crawl, or walk totteringly &mdash; fundamentally intact, you see, but encumbered with limitations that can only be changed with time and effort.I remember learning just enough of my dad&#8217;s old work computer to find tic-tac-toe and play it on the flickering amber screen. A few years later, primitive UIs are emerging, so primitive that the command line is still unarguably the more powerful tool. Just as Generation I begins to learn to read and to speak, the PC can be communicated to in what we understood as plain language. The first truly popular computers proliferate, running DOS, and a few of us were lucky enough to play with one of the later Apple II models.In 1990 the GUI and the more complex tools it enables begin to flourish and become fundamental to the PC experience, as Windows 3.0 and the Mac Classic hit the market. Shortly after that, the first affordable modems. BBSes, AOL and its chatrooms and fake internet, and then the revelation of the true web with Mosaic, Internet Explorer, and so on. I won&#8217;t waste your time with further details you&#8217;re almost certainly familiar with (having lived through them), but you must see the way things are not moving at the rate of a stage per generation like the car. No &#8211; they moved more quickly, but not so quick that we lost track. This particular speed of maturation (from &#8220;infancy&#8221; to &#8220;adulthood,&#8221; which we may define as, say, Windows XP or OS X; after that I believe the core functionality of the PC OS has not been substantially altered), which is roughly the same as the speed of maturation for a human being, and Generation I has the privilege of being the computer&#8217;s twin sibling, if you will.Though the virtue of being born at the right time is not ours to claim, nor is it simply a novelty that Generation I has grown up in tandem with a world-defining technology. As we grew up with it, we have seen and participated in all the stages of generational technology. We witnessed as children the squabbling between Atari, Microsoft, Amiga, and all the others as the beat the raw metal of computing technology into a shape the world could use. We knew it when it was young, and then we helped it become a household technology by simply being in the household, the way baby boomer kids grew up around cars and ended up knowing cars better than any generation before them. However, cars as a technology practically stood still for the car kids&#8217; formative stages. Not so for us: every year the computer was changing its case, its OS, its capabilities, its interface &mdash; everything changed about it, but we still recognized it, the way we&#8217;d recognize an old playmate year after year who, though changing in size, aspect, and ability, we still know. That is how Generation I knows the computer, the internet, the smartphone, and whatever comes next. Not as a series of devices, but as the natural progression of a friend whom we know by sight in spite of the changes wrought by time and culture. Perhaps it is best expressed that we know the ghost in the machine, that which has informed and guided the progression of the technology from household appliance to a tool as fundamental as the wheel.Captain Nemo took pride in the Nautilus &#8220;moving through a medium of movement.&#8221; He meant the ocean, of course, a place that is never the same one instant to the next, but which he nonetheless knew and navigated freely because&#8230; well, because he had a submarine. The metaphor doesn&#8217;t extend that far. But the idea of moving in a moving medium is a powerful one. To truly understand the way that the world changes around you, and to not only be able to survive in it but to thrive, to navigate, to direct that change, that is the privilege of a generation born into movement.I see in my flight of fancy I&#8217;ve really built up Generation I into quite a ridiculously grand thing, and in doing so made the same mistake that I described in the first sentence of this article. I did not mean to do so, but the simple  boon of being born alongside a world-changing technology is not minor: it matured with us and has shaped us as much as we have shaped it, and that means that we are on the front line for the Mirror Stage of the information age. Can you forgive me for being excited to be a part of a sea change in civilization, a change in infrastructure perhaps more fundamental than the integration of the automobile? Few events in history are the equal of this impending shift, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. I of course don&#8217;t claim it for myself or my generation; it is a glory we will share in, but which we may be able to uniquely enjoy. Imagine being the childhood friend of the first man to set foot on Mars. It&#8217;s no credit on yourself exactly, but you just may understand him more fundamentally than anybody else.What&#8217;s that I hear you saying? That we haven&#8217;t actually contributed much to the progress of the personal computer and the internet? Very true! If I&#8217;ve claimed otherwise I&#8217;m very sorry, because Generation I, like the baby boomer generation in the 60s, isn&#8217;t quite ready to make our mark. The fact is we&#8217;re just starting out. What was the work of the baby boomers? Was it driving cars around fast and knowing how to clean a carburetor? Hell no. Their task wasn&#8217;t just to know the technology that would shape their world, but to shape their world. And that&#8217;s our job as well. What changes the world will know in the next 20 years are impossible to predict, but you better believe that Generation I are going to set their shoulders to it. The Mirror Stage awaits.And why Generation I? Before us is Generation X, or so we are told. I&#8217;ve heard people my age, or my brother&#8217;s, as Generation Y. It&#8217;s no use naming a generation before their purpose is clear; otherwise the Greatest Generation would be called the Kaiser Kids or something horribly inappropriate. Generation I occurred to me as I was writing this piece, and as far as I can tell it&#8217;s the most evocative of that which truly defines us.Generation I reflects the burst of technology which in the last decade (as we ourselves have made our real-world debut), has become commonplace, and the prefix &#8220;i-&#8221; has become a universal indicator of tech. Yes, it&#8217;s a bit of a capitulation to Apple, but let&#8217;s not fool ourselves: the iPod and iMac immediately became so synonymous with personal technology that i- became generic almost overnight. So we&#8217;ve got Generation i. To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure if I prefer i or I. I think that, like other instances of the letter, capitalization may vary.Generation I is also Generation Me: the increasing independence and compartmentalization of the social order that is the result of the personal computer and the internet, our totem technologies. It&#8217;s the paradox of instant connection and constant isolation.And Generation I is Generation One. This is the most important of all. The coincidence of timing that resulted in us being born with silicon in our mouths also charges us with a serious responsibility &mdash; though what it may be is yet unknown. No generation is warned of the tribulations ahead, though with luck our task will be suited to our unique position. But why the One? If, as I suspect, we are in fact the first wave of a new, tech-integrative sort of people, then surely the kids born after us, into a world already possessing high-speed internet, Wikipedia, and GPS smartphones, are Generation II. What better than to start giving version numbers to our offspring? Seems like something Generation I would do.I&#8217;d like to conclude with an apology. If you&#8217;ve read this far, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re seething with anger at having been excluded from what I seem to think is the most awesome generation of all time, who invented everything worthwhile and will do everything important in the future. I want to correct that potential misconception, though I understand where it&#8217;s coming from. Obviously the pioneers of the information age are largely baby boomers, and of course Generation X is one of the great utilizers of technology. And for that matter, kids today fulfill many of the conditions that I think make Generation I so special. I can only say that I tend to get carried away, and that our special situation is really the main thing we have going for us. Am I reaching? Very likely. Am I romanticizing? Most certainly. Let&#8217;s chalk it up to youthful vigor.It is probably true that every distinct generation is born into a confluence of circumstances that is consequential in its own way. Too often, though, I have felt that people my age have been maligned as a passive generation, one of consumption and luxury. That&#8217;s actually true as far as it goes, but there is much beneath the surface; who would have thought that the boomers, flower children and hot-rodders in the 60s, would be galvanized by the civil rights movement and Vietnam, emerging to become the most powerful demographic in the country, and perhaps the world, for decades running? It is toward such heights that Generation I must drive itself. We must show ourselves equal to the special favor we have been granted, and do our part to carry the world into the next age, whatever it asks of us.Note: if you comment about how this article was too long for you to read, your comment will be deleted.

Rob Solomon is joining as the company&#8217;s president.  Solomon is a venture partner at Technology Crossover Ventures, which he joined after selling travel search engine SideStep to Kayak for $200 million.  He was the CEO at SideStep, and prior to that was the VP of Yahoo Shopping.Now will help lead fast-growing Groupon.  Founder Andrew Mason will remain CEO.  &#8220;Social commerce is something I have always been fascinated with,&#8221; Solomon tells me.  He thinks that the virality that comes with online social connections will take e-commerce to the next level.  Groupon offers group buying at the local level which is only triggered once a certain minimum number of participants agree to buy.  As local businesses try to figure out what will replace the Yellow Pages and radio advertising, Groupon hopes to fill in that gap.The company&#8217;s &#8220;growth is spectacular in revenues and users,&#8221; says Solomon, without going into more details (but the numbers are spectacular enough for him to move from sunny Silicon Valley to Chicago).  The company operates in 45 markets, has made 2.5 million group purchases on behalf of customers so far, and says it&#8217;s saved them $117 million.  Groupon recently raised $30 million at a rumored $250 million valuation.  And, yes, it is still hiring.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As we noted a couple days ago, the so-called &#8220;Location War&#8221; was essentially an even match throughout the first few days of the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. The services were in a dead-heat when it came to check-ins through Sunday, based on data we&#8217;d seen. But when it comes to tweets from the respective services, Foursquare, it seems, is dominating.I had the service Trendrr send me some data for tweets being sent out with &#8220;4sq.com&#8221; and &#8220;gowal.la,&#8221; the short URLs for each service. As you can see in the graph above, while Gowalla has a much more steady stream of tweets sent to Twitter, Foursquare has huge spikes. In total, according to the Trendrr data, Foursquare is averaging about 500 Twitter posts per hour with peaks as high as 1,329 posts per hour. Gowalla is averaging about 100 posts per hour with a peak of 190 posts per hour.Now, a few caveats: first, Foursquare has several actions that can be set to auto-tweet, which Gowalla doesn&#8217;t have. For example, when you unlock a badge or take over a mayorship on Foursquare, many people have their accounts set up to autotweet. Then, of course, there is checking-in. Gowalla tweets out only when you check-in at a place (if you set it to do so).Second, this data is only for the past two days (Trendrr wasn&#8217;t tracking it before I asked), and it&#8217;s worldwide. The check-in data I cited for the dead-heat location war was from Austin only.That said, there&#8217;s a reason why others are thinking Foursquare is dominating Gowalla, even here at SXSW: The amount of tweets sent from Foursquare seems way above the Gowalla tweets. I&#8217;ve noticed it, as have a dozen or so other people I&#8217;ve talked to here. Again, that doesn&#8217;t mean Foursquare is dominating in actual usage, just that they have a better system set up for this type of viral messaging (which plenty of people hate).Trendrr also has more comprehensive data for the terms &#8220;Foursquare&#8221; vs. &#8220;Gowalla&#8221; (and they included &#8220;Loopt) on Twitter. There, as well, Foursquare dominates averaging about 20,000 posts a day, with Gowalla at just 3,000 a day (find that chart below). But that could also be because when Foursquare autotweets from accounts it includes the &#8220;@foursquare&#8221; branding on the end of the tweet while Gowalla does not.Look for more comprehensive data about the Location War over the next few days.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There&#8217;s no question that Google is setting its sights on taking some of Microsoft&#8217;s marketshare in the productivity suite space. Last year, Google announced a new plug-in that syncs Googleâ\\x80\\x99s enterprise versions of Apps, including Gmail, contacts, and calendar, with Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s Outlook. And Google just acquired Docverse, an application lets users collaborate directly on Microsoft Office documents. Today Google is taking another swipe at Microsoft with a new tool that makes it significantly easier to make the switch over to Google Apps from Microsoft Exchange.Google Apps Migration for Microsoft Exchange is a new server-side tool that migrates a company&#8217;s email, calendar and contact data from Microsoft Exchange, an email server software product from Microsoft, to Google Apps.  Google promises ease with the tool, allowing IT administrators the ability to select the mail, calendar and contact data to move in phases and migrate hundreds of users at the same time. Plus, employees can use Exchange during the migration without any interruption. The tool works with Exchange 2033 and 2007 for both on-premise and hosted applications and is available to the enterprise and education versions of Google Apps. This is clearly a play at showing businesses how simple it is to move from from Microsoft products, such as Exchange, that may not be hosted in the cloud to the cloud-based Google Apps product. Google product Manager Matt Glotzbach told me that the search giant wants to make it as simple as possible for potential customers to make the switch to Google Apps, and many potential Google Apps&#8217; clients are using Microsoft Exchange to host and power email, calendar, and contacts. Google also launched Google Apps Migrator for Lotus Notes and a Connector for BlackBerry Enterprise Server. Google Apps has steadily been growing; already 25 million people are using the Apps product. And that also includes over 2 million businesses ranging from startups, to small businesses, to Fortune 500 companies. And Google is developing a compelling ecosystem around Google Apps, recently launching the Google Apps Marketplace, which is an an app store for enterprise apps in the cloud. \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

Similar to the previous complaints, this lawsuit filed by Boris Levitt, the owner of Renaissance Furniture Restoration in San Francisco, claims that Yelp&#8217;s &#8220;unfair and unethical conduct in promoting, marketing and advertising its website as maintaining unbiased reviews&#8221; is unlawful and hurt his business. Levitt&#8217;s suit is similar to the previous claims that Yelp is extorting businesses for advertising. We&#8217;ve embedded the complaint below. The business claims that after declining a request to purchase advertising on Yelp, a number of positive reviews from his business&#8217; listing on the reviews site mysteriously disappeared, downgrading the company&#8217;s rating on the site. Levitt claims that ten out of eleven five star reviews were removed from his company&#8217;s page following his decision not to purchase advertising on Yelp. Two weeks ago,  the company got slapped by a lawsuit from from the Dâ\\x80\\x99ames Day Spa of San Diego County, accusing Yelp of removing many positive reviews because the spa declined to run ads on the site. And the previous week, two law firms, Beck &amp; Lee from Miami and The Weston Firm in San Diego, filed a class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court alleging unfair business practices by local business review and rating website operator Yelp.The lawsuit alleged that the heavily funded startup runs an &#8220;extortion scheme&#8221; and has &#8220;unscrupulous sales practices&#8221; in place to generate revenue, in which the companyâ\\x80\\x99s employees call businesses demanding monthly payments in the guise of advertising contracts, in exchange for removing or modifying negative reviews.Additionally, today, nine small businesses from across the United States have joined the Beck &amp; Lee and Weston suit, including The Bleeding Heart Bakery in Chicago; Bleeding Heart Bakery of Chicago, Illinois; Scion Restaurant of Washington, D.C.; J.L. Ferri Entertainment, Inc. of New York, New York; Sofa Outlet of San Mateo, California; CelibrÃ©, Inc. of Torrance, California; Astro Appliance Service of San Carlos, California; Wag My Tail, Inc., of Tujunga, California; Le Petite Retreat, of Los Angeles, California and Mermaids Cruise of San Francisco, CaliforniaLast year, the East Bay Express ran an explosive story, basically accusing Yelp of being in the &#8216;Business of Extortion 2.0&#8242;, which covered similar ground. Shortly after reporter Kathleen Richards published the article, Yelp vehemently denied everything and called her piece inaccurate.Yelp CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman has explicitly denied that they ever offered preferential treatment in exchange for money.\\t\\t\\t\\tBoris Levitt Vs.

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s hard to imagine a Web sans URL shortening services nowadays but you can rest assured that they&#8217;re here to stay &#8211; for better or worse. Question is: how do the likes of bit.ly, TinyURL and Goo.gl score in terms of speed and availability?That&#8217;s exactly what Dutch startup WatchMouse sought to find out, by monitoring the performance and uptime for 14 popular URL shorteners for a whole month.Turns out most really don&#8217;t perform all that well, and that URL shorteners actually increase the load time of pages significantly. As you can tell from the graph embedded above, a lot of URL shortening services add half to nearly a full second to page load times. To measure this, WatchMouse checked each URL shortener every five minutes from one of its monitoring stations, which are located across the globe. For each short URL, only the redirection was measured, not the actual loading of the target page.Pingdom did similar research on the speed and reliability of URL shortening services in August 2009, although they only looked at independent URL shorteners and not the ones from Microsoft, Facebook and Google.Google does a pretty good job in terms of performance with Goo.gl and YouTu.be, but it still takes those about 1/3 of a second to resolve pages, which makes a world of difference if you think about how many website addresses get shortened on a daily basis.According to WatchMouse&#8217;s findings, Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s FB.me is by far the slowest of the pack, adding over two seconds on average to the page load time after the click on a link. Another interesting thing the company noticed is that only a few of the URL shorteners optimized their name servers for international use â\\x80\\x93 i.e. it takes half a second for some of the URL shorteners just to look up the IP address that is needed for a browser to retrieve a Web page. As for the availability of the URL shortening services: most do reasonably well in this regard, with snurl.com performing worst of the bunch with south of 98% uptime. Facebook&#8217;s fb.me registered the third worst uptime out of the 14 services that were tracked, although that still means about 99.5% availability &#8211; which isn&#8217;t terrible. Now all they have to do is speed it up a little.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Similar to Epicurious, AllRecipes, or FoodNetwork.com, KitchenDaily features a recipe database of meals that have been tested by top chefs, food magazine and cookbook publishers. AOL has recruited a number of talent from Conde Nast&#8217;s recently shuttered Gourmet Magazine. Former Gourmet Editor Cheryl Brown is the editor-in-chief with a number of former Gourmet writers named as contributors. Epicurious&#8217; Megan Steintrager will be the senior editor of the site. In addition to recipes, KitchenDaily will feature a meal-planner tool, cooking lessons, cookbook reviews, and and more than 250 instructional videos created by celebrity chefs and industry insiders. AOL already has a food blog called  Slashfood though its unclear how the two sites will be integrated. The recipe site space is crowded, with a number of worthy competitors vying for traffic. And even Microsoft&#8217;s Bing launched its own recipe search product. But its seems that KitchenDaily aims to be part magazine, part recipe site, so it may be able to differentiate itself and possibly attract many former Gourmet readers. We know that AOL CEO Tim Armstrong is bullish on niche content so the launch of this site fits into the company&#8217;s strategy nicely. \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A new startup dubbed nPario and formed by ex-Yahoo and SAS executives opened its business operations today. The company essentially wants to help clients better understand and market consumer commercial intent through optimal data management and data mining products and services.The company is led by former senior Yahoo executives Bassel Ojjeh (he left the Sunnyvale company in November 2009) and Krishna Uppala, and former SAS executive Basel Tutunji. According to a regulatory filing, the Palo Alto startup recently raised $300,000 in seed funding.The company&#8217;s website is pretty scarce on details, but according to the release nPario will deliver data solutions that allow companies to increase their revenue by acting upon consumer behavior insights.In the words of Ojjeh, founder, president and CEO of nPario:â\\x80\\x9cThe digital world gives us an unprecedented opportunity to identify and understand the commercial intent of consumers in order to deliver the right message or product. At nPario, we believe that organizations stand to boost revenue by more than 10% if they harness the power of consumer intent. Our goal is to provide our customers with a comprehensive set of data products that focus on the vast amount of commercial behavior data and generate immediate impact to their business and revenue.â\\x80\\x9dPrior to nPario, Ojjeh served as Senior Vice President of the Strategic Data Solutions division at Yahoo, where he was responsible for building data products that leveraged Yahoo data to drive audience engagement and advertising revenues, so it&#8217;s safe to say he knows what he&#8217;s talking about. Still according to the release, CTO Krishna Uppala is behind more than 15 database technology patents &#8211; he served as Senior Director/Architect at Yahoo before nPario.Finally, nPario Chief Revenue Officer Basel Tutunji will be responsible for sales and business development for the startup. Before nPario, Tutunji held sales management roles at several multinationals including SAS, Intershop Communications and Oracle.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Even the Mac Pro with it&#8217;s Quad-Core Xeon isn&#8217;t the fastest kid in town anymore with the six-core Core i7-980X making the rounds. Hopefully all this fuss concerning a supposed leak of new Mac pricing that&#8217;s a bit higher than the current MSRPs foreshadows updates coming in the near future.Look at the the MacBook Pro specs. They&#8217;re a joke compared to Windows machines now. Sure, Windows buyers have always gotten a better deal on hardware than those willing to pay the Apple Tax, but it&#8217;s really bad right now.The HP ENVY 15 specs out better with a Core i5-430M instead of a Core 2 Duo, 1GB ATI GPU, and the same hard drive and memory size for $700 less. Or you can order a custom build Envy 15 with a Core i7, 640GB hard drive, 6GB of memory, for $1949 instead of the $1999 like in a MacBook Pro. (You get USB 3.0 with the HP, too)This is sad, but a similar situation can be replicated with notebooks from Dell, Toshiba, and even Sony. PC notebooks have been rocking the Core i5 and Core i7 processors for months now, while Mac buyers are only offered older technology.It&#8217;s nearly as bad with the Mac Pro line, too. The current hardware was introduced on March 3, 2009. They were rock-solid then, as one of the first systems to come with the quad-core Xeon &#8220;Nehalem&#8221; processor. But that was over a year ago and Apple hasn&#8217;t updated anything including the base ram or hard drive size since.Now PC running the 6-core Core i7-980X have started to appear. Hopefully Apple will follow suit and out Mac Pros utilizing the 6-core Xeon 5680Â\\xa0chip shortly. But it won&#8217;t be the first system with that chip. Nope Dell and IBM both introduced systems on Tuesday using it.But as far as this pricing rumor goes, apparently it lists prices above the current ones. It comes from anÂ\\xa0AustralianÂ\\xa0source, which apparently inflates the pricing over the US-set MSRP, though. But maybe it&#8217;s just because instead of being competitive with PCs for once, Apple tacked on the customary tax on new hardware.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'An independent study released this morning by neutral app store GetJar indicates that the market for mobile apps should grow to a whopping $17.5 billion within the next three years. This would basically mean that the value of apps sold would be greater than the value of CDs sold in 2012 ($13.83 billion).According to the same study, downloads of mobile apps to handsets will leap from slightly more than seven billion in 2009 to nearly 50 billion in 2012, representing a YOY growth of 92%.The figures are pretty much in line with other forecasts, such as research2guidance&#8217;s prediction that the worldwide smartphone application market will grow from $1.94 billion in 2009 to $15.65 billion by 2013.GetJar had commissioned independent consulting firm Chetan Sharma Consulting to look into the global mobile apps market, in order to analyze the potential and real value of the mobile apps market worldwide, using first-hand data.According to the study, by 2012, off-deck paid-for apps will be the biggest revenue generator, accounting for almost 50 per cent of all apps revenue. By comparison, in 2009, on-deck apps available from mobile operators accounted for over 60% of all apps revenue, but this will fall significantly to just under 23% by 2012.The average app selling price for apps in North America was $1.09, significantly higher compared to that in developing markets such as South America ($0.20) and Asia ($0.10). According to the study, revenue opportunities in Europe are set to soar from $1.5 billion in 2009 to $8.5 billion in 2012, while in North America the figure will rise from around $2.1 billion to around $6.7 billion in 2012. Currently, apps are most popular in Asia, with the region accounting for 37% of global downloads in 2009. However, while Asia had the highest number of downloads, users in North America spent the most money on apps, accounting for over 50% of revenue.GetJar CEO Ilja Laurs first presented the results of the study at my conference, Plugg, last week.

The eBay company has just announced plans to double its presence in the Asian-Pacific region by the end of 2010, and made a couple of other, separate announcements to underscore its focus on Asia.At PayPal&#8217;s new international headquarters in Suntec City, Singapore&#8217;s technology hub in the middle of the nation&#8217;s central business district, the company said that it plans to double the number of employees in Asia Pacific from 1,000 currently to more than 2,000 by the end of the year. The company plans to add more than 100 new jobs at its international headquarters in Singapore alone, as it represents all of the company&#8217;s business outside of the United States.New jobs will be located at all seven offices in the region including Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. For its Singapore business headquarters and development center, PayPal will be recruiting Singapore-based professionals with expertise in technology, product development, infrastructure design, risk and engineering.PayPal says it has processed more than $6 billion of total payment volume (at spot rate) in Asia Pacific in 2009, an increase of 38 percent from 2008. Since its establishment in the region in 2006, the company has struck dozens of partnerships with Asian companies including this morning&#8217;s announcements today with DBS, Singapore&#8217;s largest bank, and China UnionPay, China&#8217;s bank card association (more about the latter deal over at BusinessWeek).As part of PayPal&#8217;s plans to help grow the e-commerce ecosystem across Asia Pacific, the company also announced that the PayPal mobile payment software development kit (SDK) will be made available to developers in the region. That way, developers can add a checkout button to accept mobile payments without the need to collect financial information from customers with just a few lines of code. The mobile SDK, which will initially support iPhone app development, will be available in the second quarter of 2010 to developers in the region.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: Big Data has been around for a long time between credit card transactions, phone call records and financial markets. Companies like AT&amp;T, Visa, Bank of America, Ebay, Google, Amazon and more have massive databases they mine for competitive advantage.  But lately, Big Data is finding its way to the smallest startups.  The Web and cloud computing brings Big Data everywhere.  But what exactly is pushing Big Data forward?To answer that we brought in an expert, Bradford Cross. Bradford is the Co-Founder and Head of Research at FlightCaster. FlightCaster is backed by Y Combinator, Tandem Entrepreneurs and Sherpalo Ventures. The company analyzes large data sets to predict flight delays. Bradford is chair of the  Dealing with Big Data track at Cloud Connect this week.We are in a Renaissance for computer science, engineering, and learning from data right now. The scale of data and computations is an important issue, but the data age is less about the raw size of your data, and more about the cool stuff you can do with it. Now that there is so much data, it is time to unlock its value. Really neat things are happening alreadyâ\\x80\\x94like the way the people of the world can educate themselves on all manner of issues and topics, or the way data and computing serves as leverage in other scientific and technical endeavors. There will be lots of amazing stuff on the web, but innovation will come in other domains as well.The recent big data trend is about the democratization of large data more than its growth. In articles like the Economist&#8217;s recent piece on the data deluge, we hear about big data everywhere. We hear about what big data and the cloud mean for the enterprise, but they have had big data for a long time. eBay manages petabytes in its Teradata and Greenplum data warehouses. Sophisticated startups extracting value from big data is also nothing newâ\\x80\\x94it has been happening at least since the days of Yahoo! and Google, and they have done it without the data warehousing folks.Now focused early stage startups can get up and running faster than ever. Less technical analysts at companies like Facebook and Twitter can access massive amounts of data easily. Even individuals can undertake cool projects with big data, such as Pete Skomoroch of Data Wrangling did with trending topics for Wikipedia.Why Now?We do not have to build all our own hardware and software infrastructure anymore.Pioneers such as Amazon have given us the cloud, where we have the capability to run very large server clusters at a low startup cost. Pioneers like Google have paved the way for open source projects like Hadoop and HBase, that are backed by big company contributors like Facebook.The combination has paved the way for a new class of data driven startup like Aardvark (just acquired by Google) and Factual, it has reduced both cost and time to market for these startups, as we showed with Flightcaster. And, it has allowed startups that were not necessarily data driven to become more analytical as they evolved, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and many others.So we have big data, the cloud, and open source facilitating new data-driven startups.  I like to break this trend down from the technical perspective into three chunks; storing data, processing data, and learning from data. I define &#8220;learning from data&#8221; to mean data mining, AI, machine learning, statistics, and so on.Supersize my data. Oh wait, I&#8217;ll just have a Medium.The first time I heard the &#8220;Medium Data&#8221; idea was from Christophe Bisciglia and Todd Lipcon at Cloudera. I think the concept is great. Companies do not have to be at Google scale to have data issues. Scalability issues occur with less than a terabyte of data. If a company works with relational databases and SQL, they can drown in complex data transformations and calculations that do not fit naturally into sequences of set operations. In that sense, the &#8220;big data&#8221; mantra is misguided at times.  For instance, a GigaOm article about big data in the cloud states:What is becoming increasingly clear is that Big Data is the future of IT. To that end, tackling Big Data will determine the winners and losers in the next wave of cloud computing innovation.The big issue is not that everyone will suddenly operate at petabyte scale; a lot of folks do not have that much data.The more important topics are the specifics of the storage and processing infrastructure and what approaches best suit each problem. How much data do you have and what are you trying to do with it? Do you need to do offline batch processing of huge amounts of data to compute statistics? Do you need all your data available online to back queries from a web application or a service API?Once your data and its processing are large enough to require distributing the data and the work among machines across network boundaries, things get a lot harder. You have to deal with distributed computing and make tradeoffs like a real computer scientist.Big Data &amp; The Cloud: Viral Buzzwords 4.0!The cloud, and hosted services, present very interesting opportunities. One of the greatest is that people can leverage the a la carte economics of elastic computing to do things that were prohibitively expensive due to the requirements of building and maintaining their own hardware infrastructure. The interesting parts about the current cloud are its lack of entrance friction and elastic cost efficiency, the speed with which new entrants can set up, and the elastic capability to run 100 machine clusters for 1 hour if that is what is needed.We started Flightcaster almost a year ago, and it is a good example of how startups can leverage cloud compute and storage resources, mix some open source like Hadoop with some data mining, and create interesting new technologies with relatively low capital upfront.The cloud is not cheaper in general.  Once people scale to a certain point, they move off the cloud onto dedicated hardwareâ\\x80\\x94not the other way around. That may change, and better hosted services may play a role in the transition, but that will take a while. In the meantime, the interesting part of the cloud is the use of elastic resources and the ability to get up and going quickly.  The interesting part is the freedom it gives startups to try things they would never otherwise do.Another notable thing about the cloud is the new architectures emerging as a result of economic and resource tradeoffs.Storage of large amounts of data in the cloud is much cheaper with blobstores like Amazon S3 than it is to maintain an always-up cluster for a distributed datastore. If you do mostly offline batch processing and you do not need bulk storage to be online, then it is an attractive setup.Storage and NoSQLTaking another glimpse from the future of big data in the cloud.A Big Data stack&#8230;will also need to emerge before cloud computing will be broadly embraced by the enterprise. In many ways, this cloud stack has already been implemented, albeit in primitive form, at large-scale Internet data centers, which quickly encountered the scaling limitations of traditional SQL databases as the volume of data exploded. Instead, high-performance, scalable/distributed, object-orientated data stores are being developed internally and implemented at scale&#8230;large web properties have been building their own so-called â\\x80\\x9cNoSQLâ\\x80\\x9d databases, also known as distributed, non-relational database systems (DNRDBMS).There are several misguided points here. First, there is not going to be a big data or cloud stack. Distributed systems are about making trade offs and a move toward problem-specific solutions rather than one-size-fits-all stacks. Second, enterprises already have their solutionâ\\x80\\x94expensive data warehousing and consulting support. Will open source projects like Hadoop supported by people like Cloudera take a chunk of the business? Sure. But as I mentioned earlier, the most interesting part about big data and the cloud is not cheaper alternatives for the enterprise, it is the opportunities it facilitates for data-driven startups.There is a lot of talk about the NoSQL movement. The big idea here is that distributed systems are hard, require tradeoffs, and sometimes we are better off with data storage and processing that are specific to what we are doing with the data. Sometimes even with a small amount of data on a single node, there are better alternatives to SQL queries and relational databasesâ\\x80\\x94time series data has long been a good example.Processing and Hadoop: The Elephant In The RoomThere is a broad range of needs for processing large amounts of data. These range from simple needs like calculations for log analysis that just need to occur at scale, to middle of the road needs like BI, to complex needs like scalable modern machine learning and retrieval systems.There are a different approaches one can use to service specific needs. Again, we see the pattern of moving away from one-size-fits-all stacks, and toward building for your needs. That said, there are very generic abstractions like Map-Reduce that work well for a lot of use cases. Distributed systems are hard to get right, so when something like Hadoop gets a lot of momentum, it retains that momentum until alternatives have the time to mature enough to solve the hard problems with fault tolerance, performance, and so forth. Not everyone is Leonardo da Vinci, so people should not attempt to create these systems on their own unless they really know what they are doing. In that sense, the cloud and big data are facilitators of open source.An important aspect of processing at scale is abstraction. Writing complex or even simple computations in raw Map-Reduce is verbose for programmers and intimidating for others who might want to play with the data. Abstractions over Map-Reduce like Pig and Hive make simple things easy, and abstractions like Cascading make hard things possible. The Map-Reduce paradigm, and Hadoop in particular, have been a big success. That said, Map-Reduce is not the only important piece of compute infrastructure. Message queues serve as the backbone of a lot of compute architectures &#8211; implementations of AMQP, such as rabbitmq, are a prime example. You can accomplish a lot with producers, consumers, and a messaging system. Distributed storage and processing systems can also be very tricky to configure and deploy, requiring a pretty deep understanding of the system &#8211; hence the business case for folks like Cloudera.Learning from Big DataHal Varian, Googleâ\\x80\\x99s Chief Economist, recently said,The sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticiansâ\\x80¦ The ability to take dataâ\\x80\\x94to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate itUnfortunately for those of us working on these problems in real life, it is not so simple. The archetypal data-renaissance man is mathematician, statistician, computer scientist, machine learner, and engineer all rolled into one. There are opportunities where you can lack some of these skills and work with a team that supplements your weak pointsâ\\x80\\x94a startup is not one of those.Now that we can store so much data, it is attractive to do previously unimaginable things with it. We are sure to see cool applications in fields from the internet to biotechnology to nanotechnology and fundamental materials science research. Almost all advances in every field of science and technology are now heavily dependent upon data and computing. Machine learning is serving a fantastic role as a bridge between mathematical and statistical models and the worlds of AI, computer science, and software engineering. We are exploring applications in learning from text, social networks, data from scientific experiments, and any other data sources we can get our hands on.The data renaissance does present some difficult issues. There are not many places one can recieve a good education on working on these problems at large scale. Scaling our modeling and optimization algorithms is hard. We need to figure out how to partition and parallelize, or sometimes trade speed and scale for approximately correct calculations. Another issue is that we are often using simplistic models, albeit with pretty good results in many cases. We would like to move toward a deeper approximation of real intelligence.But the data renaissance is here.  Be a part of it.CrunchBase Information',\n",

According to a release, the investment will be used to expand MetroGames&#8217; development of games and its social gaming platform. Playdom&#8217;s CEO, John Pleasants will join MetroGames&#8217; board. MetroGames has over 30 games on both Facebook and its own standalone social gaming site. In the release, Pleasants said that he believes that the company will become a &#8220;big player in the social gaming market.&#8221; It&#8217;s no secret that Playdom is eying the Facebook gaming market that Zynga dominates. The social gaming company just bought Facebook game developer Offbeat Creations. In November, Playdom raised a massive $43 million at a $260 million valuation. As we reported at that time, Playdom&#8217;s presence on MySpace was strong. Their Mob Wars game has 14 million or so users there, and the company was likely pulling in $60 million or more in revenue at that time. According to our stats from November, Playdom had 28 million monthly game users with 60% of traffic is from MySpace v. 40% from Facebook. CrunchBase Information',\n",

It works as a standalone app integrated with the email on your Blackberry, but similar to Xobni&#8217;s Outlook plugin, it ranks your contacts by importance and pulls in social data from Facebook, LinkedIn and other places.Along with the Blackberry app, Xobni is introducing another product which may turn out to be more important in the long run.  It is called Xobni One, and it syncs your Xobni contacts in Outlook with your contacts on your Blackberry, all in the cloud.  As Xobni rolls out more apps in the future, Xobni One should be able to sync contacts across those as well (very Mesh-like).Xobni One is a way to sync your desktop and mobile contacts.  If you use Outlook on your desktop at work, but Gmail on your Blackberry, Xobni One reconciles the two.  And when you leave your job, your contacts stay with you.  Xobni One isn&#8217;t free.  It costs $4 a month or $40 a year, bundled with the Blackberry app.  Keeping your contacts in sync is expensive.

       "  'comments_content': 'Today, during his keynote address at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek had a big revelation: &#8220;On certain days, we&#8217;re consuming more Internet capacity than Sweden has as a country.&#8221;Ek made the statement when asked why Spotify chose to use a P2P model, rather than centrally store all of its music in one place and stream it from there. Ek noted that if they were to stream from one UK datacenter, they&#8217;d consume all the bandwidth. So instead, they leverage the power of the Internet to get their users to help them stream to other users.Ek also said this was primarily the reason that Spotify is a native application, rather than a web app. P2P streaming is a bit more complicated than streaming from one source on the backend of things, obviously.When asked why Apple (which of course, runs the largest music store in the world, iTunes) doesn&#8217;t use the P2P method, Ek said that was the &#8220;million dollar question.&#8221; He then speculated that they will move more towards Spotify in terms of being in the cloud (something we&#8217;ve written about a few times), and having a subscription model.Ek noted that Spotify is now in six countries and has over 320,000 paid subscribers. That&#8217;s up from 260,000 the last time they mentioned it. Overall, they have some 7 million users now. And yes, that&#8217;s largely without the U.S. where the service only exists in a very limited closed beta as the company negotiates with the labels for music rights.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Now it is automating the way that Flash overlay ads can be created and displayed on YouTube videos.  Through the self-serve Display Ad Builder in Google AdWords, mom-and-pop businesses can now create Flash overlay ads as easily as they can create display banner ads and place them in YouTube videos.Overlay ads have been around for a long time on YouTube and other video networks.  YouTube constantly refines the types of overlay ads it shows, but many of the small businesses which typically advertise on Google AdWords don&#8217;t have the tools to create Flash overlay ads.  Now Google is providing them with templates, much like it does already for banner ads.As of last October, YouTube was showing ads on more than one billion videos a week, which was roughly one in seven videos.  YouTube wants to open up all of its video inventory to advertisers large and small.  Today&#8217;s release is the latest move in that direction.At what point will there be too many ads and will consumers ever backlash?  Already I find those persistent pop-ups and overlays to get in the way of the videos I am trying to watch, and I don&#8217;t find them particularly relevant.  Flooding YouTube with even more of these ads may be good for its bottom line, but viewers are not going to like them.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m here at the last keynote of SXSW, where Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is being interviewed by Wired&#8217;s Eliot Van Buskirk.  Ek will likely be revealing some new announcements about Spotify during this interview. I&#8217;ll be live blogging my notes below.Van Buskirk kicked off the keynote by asking how many people in the audience had used Spotify, leading a significant portion of the audience to raise their hands.  This was surprising, because Spotify is only widely available in Europe (you need a beta invite to use it in the US). Ek then took some time to walk the audience through the streaming music service if they haven&#8217;t used it before (see our extensive past coverage if you need a refresher).Q: What drove the initial decision to make this an application as opposed to something in the browser?A: There are a few things that applications are better for. In our case, we think that applications are better for swift music playback. What we see is that people tend to spend a lot of time on Spotify because it&#8217;s so swift. They tend to replace their media player with Spotify, because they notice no difference between playing a song locally (some have even remarked that it&#8217;s faster than playing it through iTunes).Q: Let&#8217;s talk about the licensing realities. Spotify is available in Europe. How will the model work in America?A:There could be slight changes. A year and a half since launch more than 7  users, only in six countries. What we&#8217;re working on is the next gen of Spotify. We&#8217;ll never be content to just have an app. There are a lot of things we want to fix in Spotify. We tend not to take the &#8216;release early, often&#8217; approach. What we&#8217;ve been working on for last 6-8 months is next gen of Spotify. How to make it more connected. Easier sharing and management of music. We&#8217;ve realized people spend a lot of time on Spotify and they tend to manage their music with Spotify.Q: Which platforms/devices are most exciting?A: Three years ago if you wanted to develop for mobile, had to support 3-5 major mobile os&#8217;s. Long lead times. That shut out all this innovation. More recently, application devs can get the application on phones. We look a lot at bundling with devices. Mostly not for revenue possibility but more for pre-installs. With exception of the iPhone today, most of the other handset manufacturers lack a good media player. Historically hard to get music to other phones if you had in iTunes.Q: Let&#8217;s talk about the business side of bundling. If someone is paying for cell phone bill, they can check off something to get Spotify, seems like easier decision. How has that been going in Europe?A: We have two mobile operators working with us many more to come. If you go into any Telius store in Sweden, you can go in and pick out a smart phone that comes preinstalled with Spotify. 3-6 months included. Incredible takeup with that. One of the key things Spotify is pushing is that people listen/share to more music than ever, more diverse artists. People will still buy music they love, but vast majority of music they just want access. Q: We&#8217;ve heard services like Spotify people say &#8220;oh no we&#8217;re not going to buy music any more&#8221;. The idea of geting people to play a monthly fee, that seems promising. Why would someone buy something?A: I think we&#8217;re going that route. But we find that music I really love, I tend to want to buy it. Not necessarily a plastic disk, but a special edition for an artist I really like, I&#8217;m more than happy to pay $100 for a box set with a t-shirt in it, liner notes. Another person may be willing to pay for a live edition with extended tracks. Or pay for a live concert experience.  The reality of the music industry today is that there isn&#8217;t one biz model. It&#8217;s about figuring out how to use downloads, streaming, promotion, ticketing, all these things.  I don&#8217;t think streaming music is stream.. with Spotify people label us &#8216;free&#8217; music. But people pay, either with time (adverts, which are targeting), or actually paying for the service.Q: Are you going to start filtering ads by mood (e.g. if you listen to down tempo music).A: We want to figure out a lot of things based on how people listen to music. Can figure out mood, brand preferences. We see that from CTRs, if you listen to same music and are from the same place who tends to like a certain brand, there&#8217;s a high likihood you will too. Ad model is getting better every month. But this for me is not about free vs paid music, it&#8217;s about a model where there&#8217;s a free music element and a paid one.A: Tech savviness at labels is increasing, now more people that love music and know the digital space are working with labels and artists. Q: How do indy artists get music on Spotify? On ITunes you can submit paperwork. You&#8217;re different in that approach.A: The way to get on Spotify today is we have a bunch of aggregators we work with. Main reason we&#8217;ve wanted to work with aggregators is that they tend to understand format/structure. We get quality control, picture, bio, etc.Q: Are we done with DRM?A: If you look at Spotify, it has DRM associated with it. We want to make it so that there isn&#8217;t really any announcement what&#8217;s DRM or not, we can protect and give users flexibility you want. Q: Let&#8217;s talk about Spotify of the future. How do we get to point of &#8216;music like water&#8217;.A: I see that&#8217;s sort of where we&#8217;re heading. The music industry needs that happen. I think music and tech are aligned for the first time. We&#8217;ve had a lot of proprietary standards, trying to figure out how to get music on a BlackBerry phone vs. getting it on iPhone vs set top box, radically different. We need to open platforms.Q: With regard to Twitter/FB. Are you thinking of integrating sharing functionality into Spotify?A: We&#8217;re looking at integrating some social aspects. I think genres are non-sane. What classifies rock, or neo-pop, etc. Spotify is quickly approaching 10 mil tracks. How do you manage that? Search is one solution, but isn&#8217;t optimal way of discovering new content. We won&#8217;t be another social network. We never believed in being our own social network, we&#8217;re working with existing social networks. Q: With your playlists people have read/write access, can delete entire thing, what are you doing about that?A: Looking from tech angle. We support version updates. One way to solve that is that you can step back in history and go back.  What we don&#8217;t have is user privilege on playlists. We think Twitter/FB will figure out those privileges, and will use them.A: I think the total rev matters more than actual conversion rate. But we do want to make sure there are a number people are paying for Spotify and that will grow. We&#8217;re making a lot of progress. We&#8217;re in six countries, now well in excess of 320,000 paid subscribers. Last time we mentioned a fig. it was 260,000. 100 million playlists. 7 million users. People spend a lot of time on playlists. 30% of all playlists are albums (albums stored in collection). People say album is dead. I don&#8217;t agree. I think there&#8217;s a lot to develop there. Q: Let&#8217;s talk about P2P element.A: It was a key decision, and one reason we&#8217;re a native app. Helps offload bandwidth. P2P actually helps Spotify and users, it will take tracks on your friends and coworkers on same local network and stream to them so it&#8217;s faster. &#8220;We&#8217;re consuming more capacity than Sweden has as a country&#8221;. If we had to stream all the data from our UK center, we&#8217;d consume all the bandwidth.Q: Why isn&#8217;t Apple doing this?A: That&#8217;s a million dollar question. I think they are. I&#8217;m just speculating on this. Apple is very interested, we&#8217;ve had iTunes store. They&#8217;re understanding this is more to subscription model. They understand it&#8217;s going more to a cloud based model. I don&#8217;t have any magical insight into Apple. Q: Let&#8217;s look at Spotify on this phone. I wanted to show this cool device. Sony Ericson X10 mini. Out in US in next couple of months. It&#8217;s an Android phone. We&#8217;ve installed Spotify. Now demonstrating the app. Has a spotify widget. A: Over the next couple of weeks a lot of features coming in to Spotify. I hope from them moving in a more steady direction. We are listening to what users are asking us to do. Q: US Launch? Also China?A: The most important thing for us when it comes to US launch is that we want to build the best possible product we can and get all ducks in a row, partnerships with next gen of Spotify. Sort out publishing which is a huge task. Here you have to strike deals with almost 5000 publishers. Big thing for us is working on next gen of Spotify and getting that out there.Q: How many plays equals one dollar?A: Depends on the type on contract with the publisher/record labels. We share the rev we bring in. You can&#8217;t really equate to &#8216;per play&#8217; we look at all our ad rev. Creates a bucket. For instance how do you account for a purchase of a song. There is no easy answer to your question. Over time our ad revs are growing, number of downloads growing. Amount of rev we bring in is growing. Q: How are it working to convince American label that not everyone needs to be a subscriber for it to work.A: This is the world&#8217;s biggest music market. We have potential reach of 170 mil people in Europe. America has much more. People spend more money in America. The whole industry is looking more and more about new opportunities. At the same time CD sales have been in decline, nothing online has been able to counter balance that decline. I think people are looking at how we can support Spotify, how do we ensure that people don&#8217;t stop buying CDs.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There&#8217;s a lot of talk today about how the Nexus One&#8217;s initial roll-out has been a flop. And while the numbers aren&#8217;t official, things do look pretty grim for the first Android device Google is attempting to sell itself. But Google is wasting no time answering its critics â\\x80\\x94 indirectly â\\x80\\x94 with the launch of a version of the device that will work on AT&amp;T&#8217;s 3G network.To be clear, this isn&#8217;t Google teaming up with AT&amp;T on the device. Instead, it&#8217;s simply a second version of the Nexus One that works with AT&amp;T&#8217;s 3G frequency, which is different than that of T-Mobile&#8217;s (the current Nexus One U.S. carrier). The original Nexus One does actually already work on AT&amp;T, but only for 2G connections, so this new version will obviously be significantly faster.With the new 3G frequency, the new Nexus One will also work in Canada with Rogers Wireless. And, as Google notes, &#8220;And like the first version of the Nexus One, it can be used with most GSM operators globally.&#8221;Certainly, giving consumers more choices is always a good thing, but it seems that Google&#8217;s attempt to sell the phone itself is really the problem here. While it makes sense that phones, like most other goods (digital cameras, for example), should be an easy sell online, there&#8217;s also some thought that the Nexus One isn&#8217;t selling well because customers are so used to walking into a store and playing with a phone for a bit before buying it. Â\\xa0If that&#8217;s the case, the AT&amp;T addition isn&#8217;t likely to help sales.The right play here would be for Google to offer shoppers a full list of plan options for both T-Mobile and AT&amp;T and let them decide which carrier to pick. Unfortunately, that won&#8217;t be happening here, because again, this new Nexus One is only being sold as an unlocked phone that can work on AT&amp;T if you get a SIM card on your own (something which most consumers will never do in the U.S.).Eventually, if Google can offer that list of options from all the carriers (including the CDMA ones like Verizon, which, yes, will require another version of the Nexus One), that could be enough to drive customers online to buy the phone (and has always been the Nexus One&#8217;s promise, in my opinion). This move today, won&#8217;t be. Also, with all the bitching about AT&amp;T&#8217;s network by iPhone owners (though, again, it has been great at SXSW), why on Earth would anyone want to buy a smartphone to use on the network unless they absolutely had to (as they do with the iPhone)?[photo: flickr/katybate]CrunchBase Information',\n",

His last guest post was an analysis of Twitter user data.It&#8217;s no surprise that Chatroulette is the latest media darling. It has all the elements of a good story: technology, mystery, celebrity, and sex. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Chatroulette, this Daily Show segment is a good primer.We were itching to study Chatroulette in a RJMetrics Dashboard, but no one seemed to have any good data for us to explore.  So, we decided compile the data ourselves by leveraging Chatroulette Map,  some scrappy programming, and a passionate tech community.  We soon had detailed data on 2,883 Chatroulette sessions that tied users to geography, gender, appearance, and more.Here are a few highlights from our findings:About half of all Chatroulette spins connects you with someone from the USA.  The next most likely country is France at 15%.Of the spins showing a single person, 89% were male and 11% were female.You are more likely to encounter a webcam featuring no person at all than one featuring a solo female.8% of spins showed multiple people behind the camera. 1 in 3 females appear as part of such a group.  That number is 1 in 12 for males.1 in 8 spins yield something R-rated (or worse)You are twice as likely to encounter a sign requesting female nudity than you are to encounter actual female nudityHow We Did ItThanks to RJMetrics, the analysis was easy.  Getting the data, however, was a bit of a challenge.  The good news, however, is that a roulette wheel is the statistician&#8217;s best friend.  The central limit theorem tells us that a large set of random observations allows us to draw high-confidence conclusions about the underlying data set.We started our process at Chatroulette Map, an awesome new site that plots screenshots from random Chatroulette sessions on a map.Chatroulette Map ties Chatters to Locations',\n",

Indeed, Twitter itself might well be hauled into court to explain why it isn&#8217;t automatically filtering and blocking Nazi material circulating since this is obviously a sensitive subject in Germany and there are specific anti Nazi laws. Ebay famously had to block the sale of Nazi memorabilia in Germany for this reason.The trouble is, Twitter is in the US, and appears not to have noticed. So the German Twitter community is trying to get Twitter to block the account with this retweeting.It will be in interesting to see how this plays out.

       "  'comments_content': 'When movie clip search startup AnyClip demoed at last year&#8217;s TechCrunch50, it was one of the crowd pleasers.  The concept was to be able to search for any line or scene in a movie, and the site would take you to that exact moment and play the clip.  The demo looked great, but could the startup actually get the movie studios to license their films?  Sean Parker, one of the judges on the panel noted: &#8220;This is the kind of thing that absolutely should happen. But it will take you twice as long to make those deals.&#8221;Parker turned out to be right.  AnyClip continues to negotiate with the studios, but decided not to wait for those deals to open up its service.  Yesterday, it launched in a public beta, without many actual video clips.  There are some older and public domain movies, licensed from the Film Chest catalog, such as the classic Reefer Madness.  Search for &#8220;faster, faster&#8221; and up comes the piano scene from Reefer Madness.But AnyClip works even for movies where it cannot show the clips.  Search for &#8220;I drink your milkshake&#8221; and the dialogue from the scene in There Will Be Blood comes up as a result.  Or you can search for &#8220;ferris wheel&#8221;  scenes, where a ferris wheel appears in the scene but is not necessarily mentioned in the dialogue.  AnyClip has indexed 2,000 movies so far. CEO Aaron Cohen estimates that &#8220;two percent of all searches appear to be for 8,000 Hollywood films and 1,000 actors.&#8221;  Creating really deep meta data around movie clips and exposing those to search engines should be enough to get traffic growing simply as movie quotes database.  But the ultimate appeal of AnyClip is the ability to start playing the movie clip at the exact moment you are looking for and share those clips.  It&#8217;s going to happen.  Rival MovieClips.com, which launched in December, has already struck licensing deals for 12,000 clips.  Those are predetermined clips, however.  AnyClip still wants to provide data on, literally, any clip.At the same time, the movie studios are paying companies to index their digital archives for their own internal purposes.  Cohen is hoping to do a trade: give them the metadata on their catalogs for free in return for the ability to promote their films.  Maybe if AnyClip gets big enough, they will start paying attention.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Notably, EPIX recently landed its fourth major cable deal by signing up Charter Communications, after sealing deals with Cox, Mediacon and Verizon FIOS.Deadline has more on what the series will be about:The showâ\\x80\\x99s lead charcter (SIC), Tom Rhodes, is a composite of that Silicon Valley titan, and the comedy is described as a savage satire, a study of ego, power and greed.And:MRC will serve as the studio and financier. The company said it had several bidders for the property, but chose EPIX because Charles could be as edgy as he wanted to be. The feeling is that the show could put EPIX on the map the way series like Mad Men did for AMC, Weeds for Showtime, and Burn Notice for USA.

       "  'comments_content': 'File syncing and storage startup Zumodrive is expanding its mobile offerings today with free applications for Android and Palm phones. While there are a plethora of syncing and storage services available to users, ZumoDrive, which spawned from Y Combinator startup Zecter, has a different take on file syncing. Similar to other services, Zumodrive creates a drive on your device that is synced to the cloud. But service includes a slightly different twist-ZumoDrive tricks the file system into thinking those cloud-stored files are local, and streams them from the cloud when you open or access them. The startup launched an iPhone app last year, which let users sync their content to their phone without having to deal with local storage capacity issues. The Android and Palm apps include much of the same functionality. The apps allows users to sync their entire iTunes library on their phones even though the songs are not locally saved.  Plus, ZumoDrive allows you to import your files. photos albums and videos onto your Android and Palm phones. Additional features include video streaming from ZumoDrive directly to devices in MP4, H.264 format, music organized by artist, albums, and even playlists created on other devices, the ability to stream music in the background and listen to music over both 3G or EDGE networks.Additionally you can access and view Microsoft Office documents and PDF files.ZumoDrive has been gaining traction over the past year. Fresh off of a $1.5 million funding round, the startup scored a deal with HP in January to to power the backend of the technology giantâ\\x80\\x99s CloudDrive on all HP Mini netbooks. Last year, ZumoDrive released a new version of its system that wirelessly syncs playlists between devices, auto-detects content, and lets users link file folders on their devices to ZumoDrive only once so that changes in that folder will always be linked to ZumoDrive. The service was also upgraded to integrate well with media applications, like iTunes, so users can play entire music libraries saved in ZumoDrive on multiple devices without manually syncing content. We initially reviewed Zumodrive here.Zecter previously launched a product called Versionate, an office-wiki product, that we first covered in July 2007. We wrote about them again a year ago. ZumoDrive faces competition from Dropbox, SugarSync, and Box.net.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'At the most recent Mobile World Congress, Google CEO Eric Schmidt revealed that the company&#8217;s partners are now selling over 60,000 Android handsets on a daily basis. With that kind of growth rate, it&#8217;s no wonder that the size of the Android Market is quickly increasing in its slipstream. While Google doesn&#8217;t publicly show how many applications there are in Android Market, a Google representative this morning informed me that the application store now serves approximately 30,000 free and paid apps in total. The application store for Android devices supposedly hit the 10,000 apps milestone in September 2009 according to third-party developer AndroLib, who later also claimed that number doubled in just over 3 months. Google at the time matched these claimed stats against its own count, and said there were in reality some 16,000 apps in Android Market in December 2009. Yesterday, I asked Google for an update to those internal stats after I noticed AndroLib currently pegs the number of apps at nearly 35,000, and this morning the company got back to me saying there are now officially 30,000 apps in the Android Market. In other words, Google says the number grew from 16k to 30k apps in exactly three months.The company declines to detail what percentage of apps in Android Market are paid versus free, but for what it&#8217;s worth, AndroLib says the ratio is about 39% paid vs. 61% free of charge.Just for comparison&#8217; sake: Apple counted over 140,000 apps in the App Store in January 2010, so it&#8217;s safe to assume there should be about 5 times as many apps for the iPhone and iPod touch as there are for Android devices right about now.Research agency research2guidance recently released a report forecasting that the total app download market could grow to a whopping $15 billion by 2013.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'TechCrunch50 2008 DemoPit company Shorthand Mobile (formerly Smart Touch) aims to help consumers who don&#8217;t use mobile data plans to access SMS and web content. Upon launch in 2008, the startup had developed a suite of basic widgets for mobile phones that visualize SMS services, allowing users to navigate through an intuitive menu. Today, Shorthand Mobile is launching TextApps, a new category of apps that deliver content from websites via SMS in a rich, interactive interface, aiming to expand the capabilities of non-smartphones and provide access to web content for mobile users without data plans.Launching in beta today on select Motorola and Nokia handsets on AT&amp;T and on Windows Mobile phones, Shorthand TextApps use SMS to expand access to top brands and mobile content including social networks, local search, sports scores, weather forecasts, movie times, news and entertainment.  TextApps is an app you download which then creates a more intuitive UI for text-based apps.Once you download Shorthand, it uses your SMS text messaging plan to connect you to the web content you want. Apps in the TextApps library include CitySearch, Netflix, Facebook Mobile, Twitter, The New York Times and Yelp. Of course, Facebook, Twitter and others have independently integrate with SMS for their sites but Shorthand claims to add more functionality by almost recreating a basic smartphone app. Shorthand is also now available in India on all major carriers and will launch in Brazil this spring. The starup will offer localized TextApps for these countries. Shorthand is free to download, but you will be charged for SMS messages via your SMS plan with your carrier. As we wrote in our initial review, year, the technology behind is very basic so users shouldn&#8217;t expect to see a iPhone like Facebook-app on their phone with TextApps. That being said, the fact that Shorthand has struck deals with Nokia and Motorola to include its offering on their phones and could become a useful way to incorporate extra functionality into basic mobile phones.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Gaming will make or break 3D. I don&#8217;t care if James Cameron sends miniature 3D cameras into Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s urethra during his &#8220;king of the world&#8221; scene in the new 3D version of Titanic: there will be no compelling reason to upgrade your entire TV set-up to watch 3D movies. Why will you buy a 3D set-up? For gaming and you&#8217;ll probably buy a 3D-capable PC before you buy a 3D-capable TV.Consider the price differential: a 3D PC kit costs about $598 without graphics card. A compatible card costs a few hundred &#8211; up to $400 for the highest-end card you can get. That&#8217;s about $1000 if you already have a nice PC and if you&#8217;re a gamer you&#8217;re probably already running a nice GeForce card.Want to get a 3D TV? Why not pick up a Samsung 62-inch plasma for $3,400? Oh, and you&#8217;ll need a new Samsung (or Sony, if that&#8217;s the family you want to join) Blu-Ray player. Want to play a 3D console game? Don&#8217;t look to your XBox. You&#8217;d better get yourself a PS3 and then find some content. But, if you have a PC, almost every game made in the past few years is 3D compatible. Talking Heads &#8211; Once In A LifetimeUploaded by hushhush112. &#8211; Explore more music videos.3D games are great. I&#8217;ve been playing Burnout Paradise for the past month and messed around a little with Batman: Arkham Aslyum and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Best of all, Civilization IV is also 3D compatible so you can see your little settlers and warriors in full 3D. Even for a crotchety old man like me it&#8217;s quite a bit of fun.3D gaming is cheap and will encourage a new generation to accept 3D as a benefit, not a burden. The current generation &#8211; folks 25 and above &#8211; still see 3D as a gimmick. Kids will see 3D as an extension of the immersive experience gaming has offered them their entire lives.Mark my words: the vast majority of TV viewers will never have a 3D TV in their home. Maybe some die-hards will buy a few pairs of glasses to watch the Super Bowl in 2015 but you and yours will probably never find any good reason to go 3D. However, if you&#8217;re a gamer you owe it to yourself to try a 3D set-up and perhaps upgrade. It&#8217;s a lot of fun.So sorry, everyone. The 3D TV party is over. 3D TV is, in short, the Laserdisc of this era and what comes next &#8211; the perfection glasses-free 3D television displays. The current crop of 3D TV is an interstitial technology aimed at grabbing a few upgrade dollars. If TV manufacturers really cared about selling a whole new crop of TVs, they&#8217;d try much harder to convince the world that it needs what they&#8217;re selling.',\n",

QR codes are generally more useful than a standard barcode is that they can store much more data.

       "  'comments_content': 'Mobile app analytics company Flurry estimates that while Apple sold 1 million iPhone devices in its first 74 days of availability on the market, the Motorola Droid actually shipped more devices during that timespan. Sales of Google&#8217;s Nexus One, by comparison, kinda stunk: the company only sold an estimated 135k phones in 74 days.Flurry reaches its conclusions through applications using its solution for analytics reporting. Because applications embedded with Flurry are said to have been downloaded to over 80% of all iPhone OS and Android devices, the company claims it can make reliable estimates about total handset sales.Check out Flurry&#8217;s blog post for possible reasons why the Motorola Droid appears to have outsold the Apple iPhone in terms of numbers of devices shipped in the first 74 days on the market.The respective launch dates of the 3 devices were: iPhone, June 29, 2007; Droid, November 5, 2009; and, Nexus One, January 5, 2010. Note that this means the Nexus One still has a few days left to reach 74 days, but it&#8217;s safe to say Google won&#8217;t be selling almost a million devices by the end of this week.Earlier this year, Flurry estimated both first week and first month sales of Nexus One sales compared to Motorola Droid and the first-gen iPhone. They paled in comparison then, and they do now.Here&#8217;s what Flurry has to say about the limited success of the Nexus One:As Google and Apple continue to battle for the mobile marketplace, Google Nexus One may go down as a grand, failed experiment or one that ultimately helped Google learn something that will prove important in years to come. Apple&#8217;s more vertically integrated strategy vs. Google&#8217;s more open Android platform approach offer strengths and weaknesses that remind us of PC vs. Mac from the 1980&#8217;s. A key difference this time around is that Apple is enjoying much more 3rd party developer support, whose innovative applications push the limits of what the hardware can do. Ultimately, however, developers support hardware with the largest installed base first. For Android to make progress faster, from a sales perspective, it needs more Droids and fewer Nexus Ones going forward.Ouch.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Which employee does what, when, how and with which tools? That&#8217;s a critical question for many companies, which usually rely on business process management (BPM) solutions to visualize, streamline, and implement predefined workflows. Just last month, enterprise SaaS behemoth Salesforce.com rolled out a new BPM tool, Visual Process Manager &#8211; only to be now challenged by a small startup called Questetra, which thinks its eponymous solution can stack up.The way Questetra&#8217;s BPM suite (and similar products) work is that users chart business workflows to identify redundancies, &#8220;bottle necks&#8221; or conflicts in future company processes. Once the design is ready, the designer can authorize other users to revise the system themselves, meaning these designs are then put to actual use in a work environment.The applicant in the reimbursement process visualized below, for instance, submits a request through the Flash application, which then notifies his supervisor who can then approve and send the request to the accounting division for a final check (there&#8217;s actually a whole bunch of different task execution functions built into the application). All actions can be managed via a user-specific dashboard, and just like with Salesforce.com&#8217;s solution, for example, Questetra  users don&#8217;t need to deal with any code.Apart from relatively low pricing and ease of use, Questetra says the &#8220;killer feature&#8221; of their suite is that it&#8217;s 100% web-based, meaning separate software isn&#8217;t required to design a process or perform a task. Another key selling point is the seamless integration with Google Apps (in the SaaS version, users can log in with their existing Google accounts and easily export data to Google Docs).Questetra, which says their suite is especially interesting for companies with  20 to 200 employees, offers a self-hosted  (downloadable) edition and an SaaS solution for $10 per user per  month (there&#8217;s also a  trial version and a number of free sample workflows). It&#8217;s also one of the first applications distributed through the Google  Apps Marketplace that launched  just last week.Questetra, which is based in Kyoto/Japan, is currently working on mobile-friendly features and an API to be rolled out in the near future. Apart from Salesforce.com&#8217;s Visual Process Manager, the Questetra BPM suite competes with SAP&#8217;s Visual Composer, Appian, and Intalio, amongst others.CrunchBase Information',\n",

And they did contact us. But they don&#8217;t feel differently. There was also a great discussion in the comments section to that post where a few MySpace employees chimed in both pro and against the company.But the emails were most telling. One wasn&#8217;t anonymous and the writer asked to keep it off record, and we&#8217;ll respect that. But he wrote at length about high level execs &#8220;chewing out&#8221; the lower ranks, in public. And lots of exec level nepotism hires.This is a theme brought up by another employee, writing anonymously. He or she confirmed that too many mid level managers are leaving the company, and talks about more yelling at employees in public (&#8220;Maple&#8221; refers to 407 North Maple Drive, the address of MySpace HQ, &#8220;Jason&#8221; refers to Co-president Jason &#8220;Hell Yeah&#8221; Hirschhorn):Dear TechCrunch-I always enjoy your article on the drama at my company â\\x80\\x93 MySpace but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never felt the urge to write until now.  I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99m writing you because your article was ABSOLUTELY dead on.  Because of that, my morale isnâ\\x80\\x99t really high and I really donâ\\x80\\x99t give much of a shit anymore.Well, the hole goes deeper than that.  Many departments are losing much of the middle layer of actual star performers, but people who canâ\\x80\\x99t get anything done due to the crazy BS in Maple.  For example, 2 directors in Jasonâ\\x80\\x99s product org are gone recently: (Director of Analytics â\\x80\\x93 Joe Schantz who went to Yahoo), Director of Product Mahesh Angadi.  Other senior middle managers like Sr Product Manager Charles Pham, who went to CitySearch and Sr. Online Marketing Manager, Laura Coltrin left and is now at EventBrite.  What do these particular people have in common? Besides being huge losses for MySpace, they were all re-orged under his royal heighn-ass, Jason.  People donâ\\x80\\x99t want to work for that moron â\\x80\\x93 heâ\\x80\\x99s just consolidating power.Today, Jeff Webber â\\x80\\x93 Director of Engineering in Seattle &#8211; gave notice (no idea where heâ\\x80\\x99s going.)Oh, and Jason really doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get along with Mike.  Jason was witnessed ripping one of his VPs a new one when the VP was trying to explain why he was doing something that Mike requested (in front of 6 other people.)  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a mess â\\x80\\x93 but it should be fun watching one run the other out of town.A bunch of other people have their foot out the door &#8211; spend some time around Maple, SF or Seattle near the front entrance and watch people disappear for hours at a time or for â\\x80\\x9clong lunchesâ\\x80\\x9d.  Its almost comical.  You see a lot of people going into empty conference room and talking on their cell phones or people â\\x80\\x9cgoing to grab coffeeâ\\x80\\x9d by themselves and chatting on the phone walking down the street.  And yeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99m one of those people.Anyway, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t just due to the fact these idiots are running the company into the ground.  The reason why people are leaving now is that MySpace gave out these big secret retention bonuses that had a 2 tier payout. Overall, the ENTIRE bonus was for anywhere from 20% to 100+% of a personâ\\x80\\x99s base.  The key is that they pay out in two segments â\\x80\\x93 you had to be working in December so that you get 25% of the bonus amount).  If youâ\\x80\\x99re employed here until June, you get the remaining 75% of their bonus.  As you can imagine, this is a LOT of money â\\x80\\x93 especially at a place that gave tiny annual raises last year (&lt;5% was the average), where we cancelled profit sharing last fiscal year (not sure you knew about that) and with no stock incentive.Itâ\\x80\\x99s a huge sign of how bad things are that they are leaving 75% of the bonus on the table.  However, since we all know that the ship is sinking, taking 25% in December was good enough. I donâ\\x80\\x99t blame them.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m out of here as soon as I get a new gig.  I earned that bonus money but Iâ\\x80\\x99m sick of this place.Oh â\\x80\\x93 and the guy who thought of this bonus plan?   Mike.  These were given out after the review cycle (August.)  So yeah, you want to write about more defections?  Wait until June and then everyone will get paid and bounce.  I and others are counting the days.  Its kinda funny â\\x80\\x93 it was supposed to be a total secret from everyone in the ranks (yes, some people didnâ\\x80\\x99t get bonuses, but those people kinda suck so who cares right?)  but now everyone is joking about it privately.-DisgruntledAnd one last employee says it&#8217;s ok to paraphrase and quote parts of his/her email. This one still has some fight left in &#8216;em. Here are some of the better parts:Until a recent reorg of the engineering group (did you cover it?  I don&#8217;t recall seeing it.), the whole company was segmented into horizontal layers so there was an operations group, a database group, an api group, a front-end group, a search group, a datawarehouse group, etc.  Anything but the most minor feature required an obnoxious amount of cross-group interaction and took huge effort just to get everyone on board and the work scheduled.  Some of that layering is being done away with, at least that is the stated goal.  In addition to the extreme layering there was a group of people who sat in the middle of the process, able to accept or reject any project; people who didn&#8217;t have the business sense to be in bizdev or be product managers and didn&#8217;t have the technical ability to be developers.  When they accepted a project for development they would (randomly?) select some developers to build it.  There were no clear lines of responsibility, no reason for anyone to really care about what they were working on, no reward for success and no punishment for failure (except for layoffs which seem to happen more or less randomly so they don&#8217;t fall on either the reward or punishment side).  This structure was called &#8216;the matrix&#8217; and thankfully was a casualty of the reorg.  Plus in the big layoffs last spring (before my time) the hardest hit groups were front-line employees, the developers and testers who do the actual work; you had these big design committees arguing back and forth for weeks or months about how and what to do and no one to do it at the end of the day.A lot of the people who are leaving and have left recently were in charge of this dysfunctional process and are unable or unwilling or just plain sick of trying.  Yes a lot of good (better anyway) technical people are leaving or have left and yes there is a lot of detailed knowledge about keeping the current code running going with them.&#8230;There are other problems besides all of that, God I&#8217;m getting sick of writing about this.  The technology platform (.net) and development methodology (scrum) and general caliber of developer (although there are exceptions) is more reminiscent of a poorly run enterprise development shop than an Internet company, certainly far far far from what you would find at a startup or Facebook or even Microsoft.&#8230;Will Mike &amp; Jason succeed at creating something functional out of this godawful mess?  Too soon to tell, I think.  The first all-hands meeting a couple of days after they took over felt like an old fashioned tent revival or something, I almost expected Zig Ziggler to show up.  But I will say that there has been more communication from them in a few weeks than from Owen in several months and they are reaching out to meet with developers working on interesting or important new projects, in short they seem engaged in a way that Owen never did.  I&#8217;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.CrunchBase Information',\n",

And frankly, just staying this side of decent is enough for most companies.So when Twitter CEO Evan Williams said earlier today that one of Twitter&#8217;s operating principles was to â\\x80\\x9cbe a force for goodâ\\x80\\x9d I cringed a little.One of the most important lessons I&#8217;ve learned in business, and am still learning, is to never trust anyone who says &#8220;you can trust me.&#8221; That&#8217;s a big red flag that they&#8217;re planning something really messed up in the near future. And likewise, a company shouldn&#8217;t be out there saying &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; or &#8220;be a force for good.&#8221; First because it&#8217;s basically impossible to balance a profit motive with a goodness motive. And in fact the nice thing about capitalism is that everyone acting in their own self interest tends to be good for everyone else, too, if appropriate government forces are put in place to stop monopolies, pollution, etc. Being a socialist is a great way to get laid in college but it&#8217;s no way to run a society. And second because when people, or governments, or companies start talking about being a force for good, there&#8217;s a good chance that a serious amount of self righteousness is brewing behind the scenes. Everyone who fights a war thinks they have God on their side. And some of the most atrocious moments in history were done in the name of good.What I&#8217;d like best is if Twitter just focuses on keeping the lights on, and adds competitive features that keep Google, Facebook and others on their toes. Let others use Twitter to do good things. Twitter should stay goodness-neutral and self righteous free.Or alternatively try to be a force for good. But just do it, don&#8217;t talk about it.

       "  'comments_content': 'Having now written two books about my failures in work, life and love, I  think I&#8217;m qualified to say that the only difference between a memoirist and a prostitute is timing.A prostitute sells sex for  money &#8211; that money being payable either immediately before or  immediately after the act. A memoirist also receives money for having  sex &#8211; but our  payment comes via a publisher, months or years later, once we&#8217;ve recounted the amusing or titillating details in print. In the final analysis, really, we&#8217;re all whores.And yet, in terms of public perception, the distinction of payment and timing is vital. Actual prostitutes are &#8211; generally speaking &#8211; looked down on by society:  labels like &#8216;whore&#8217; and &#8216;hooker&#8217; being, almost without exception, used pejoratively. Memoirists, on the other hand, tend to be reasonably well regarded, not least by themselves. For that reason, accidentally calling a hooker a memoirist is unlikely to cause offense, but accidentally call a memoirist a hooker and&#8230;  hoo boy&#8230;This time last week, my friend Zoe Margolis &#8211; who  writes as the Girl With A One Track Mind &#8211; was asked by the UK&#8217;s  Independent on Sunday (IoS) newspaper to write a column about how she  went from being an anonymous sex blogger to a widely-recognised advice  columnist and memoirist. Zoe, I should emphasise, does not have sex for  money. I know this for a fact: we shared a house at SXSW a couple of  years ago and she stubbornly refused to sleep with me, despite the fact  that I paid for all of our groceries at Whole Foods.And yet,  thanks to an astonishing but &#8211; I hope &#8211; innocent piece of lazy  subediting, when the IoS published her column they did so under the  unambiguously libellous headline &#8220;I was a hooker who became an agony  aunt&#8220;.Hoo boy.The IoS reaslised its mistake (for want of  a better word for &#8220;misquoting one of our writers as calling herself a  whore&#8221;) within an hour of the paper going to press and quickly changed  the headline in print and online. But of course the damage was already  done. Although, according to the paper, only a couple of thousand hard  copies had been dispatched to news stands, the web version had already  been syndicated to dozens of other sites &#8211; including Yahoo! &#8211; and such  far-flung newspaper websites as the Times of India. Worse still, it took  several more hours &#8211; and increasingly vocal complaints by Zoe &#8211; before  the IoS changed the story&#8217;s URL which still contained the full wording  of the original headline.An embarrassing screw up for the  Independent &#8211; but one that other papers can learn from, right?Not  so much.A few days later, another UK paper &#8211; The Daily Mail &#8211;  ran a story headlined &#8220;I posed as a girl of 14 on Facebook. What  followed will sicken you &#8230;&#8221; The story was indeed sickening;  written by a former police detective, it revealed how after signing up  to Facebook as a young girl, he was immediately contacted by middle-aged  men looking for sex. There was just one problem with the story: it  wasn&#8217;t true.For a start the story was ghost-written by a  Mail journalist, loosely based on a phone interview with the detective.  More importantly, the detective had made clear &#8211; repeatedly &#8211; that the  social network in question wasn&#8217;t Facebook. In fact he&#8217;d actually  praised Facebook for having put in place measures to protect young users  against &#8216;grooming&#8217; by adults. Unfortunately, the Mail seems to have a  beef with Facebook &#8211; they previously accused the site of causing cancer &#8211;  and so decided to name and shame it both in the article, and in the  headline and &#8211; yup &#8211; in the URL. As with Zoe&#8217;s story, the headline was  changed after a few hours (having already been widely syndicated) but  the libellous URL remained uncorrected for more than a day.In  both cases, the result was the same &#8211; the Independent and the Mail each  issued apologies and corrections in the next day&#8217;s paper and online but both Zoe and Facebook say they  intend to take legal action both for the initial error but also for the  further harm done by the time the papers took to correct their libellous URLs.We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what comes of the  proposed lawsuits, but in the meantime both cases illustrate a huge  problem with the blurring of the line between old and new media. In the  old days, editors understood how their papers worked. If a libellous  story was printed, they would stop the presses (if it wasn&#8217;t already too  late) and they would issue an apology the next day. Most readers would see the apology and all would be well. Yes, there  might still be a libel action, but at least the publication could show  that they&#8217;d halted the presses and issued the apology, thus mitigating  some of the damage done.Today, that&#8217;s no longer the case. The  simple fact is that many editors have absolutely no idea how their  papers work any more. According to the Guardian, when Charles Garside,  assistant editor of the Daily Mail, was asked about the fact that the  libellous URL was unchanged for more than 24 hours, he described it as  &#8220;a technical matter&#8221;, adding: &#8220;We are removing elements of that&#8221;.&#8220;A  technical matter&#8221; &#8211; which of course is code for &#8220;I have absolutely no  idea how the Internet works. We have geeks to do that kind of thing, and  they were at home &#8211; probably masturbating or watching Battlestar  Galactica &#8211; or both &#8211; when the story went up&#8221;With those three  words &#8211; &#8220;a technical matter&#8221; &#8211; Garside lays bare the problem newspapers  face in moving online. Editors understand stories and they understand  headlines, but today they also need to understand URLs and automatic syndication and all of  the other &#8220;technical matters&#8221; that are just as much a part of the modern  newspaper as standfirsts and pullquotes. This is a lesson I learned the  hard way back in 2005 when I was hit with an enormous libel  claim (and the possibility of imprisonment for contempt of court) when the publication I edited  linked to a libellous story (published in France) about a certain  English Premiership football player. Although we were careful not to  name the player in our story, we were still held responsible for  identifying him because the URL we published contained his surname. The  fact that we&#8217;d used our in-house link-shortener to mask the true URL was  no defence as the shortener was hosted on our own server and resolved  to the correct address before the reader left our site. Since that day,  I&#8217;ve understood that a URL can get you in just as much legal hot water as  an ill-judged headline.Unfortunately that seems to be a lesson  that editors at certain major national newspapers are yet to learn. If I  were the owner of the Independent, or the Mail, or any other newspaper  I&#8217;d insist that my editors spend a few hours of their time learning how  their papers work in the digital age. That means understanding not just  how to stop presses and issue apologies but also how to get under the  hood and change URLs; how automatic syndication works and how to ensure  any subsequent apology is amended to every online version, and not just  the one hosted on their main site.Finally, the way that  apologies and clarifications are published needs to be seriously  re-thought. Publishing a correction in the next day&#8217;s paper, or as a separate item on the publication&#8217;s website, is a ridiculous anachronism. People  no longer read the same paper every day: the fact that they stumbled  across a story in the Independent or the Daily Mail once through Google  News doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll ever read a story in that paper again. It  certainly doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll see a correction published 24 hours  later.Whereas once a libel court could be satisfied that the  publication of a printed apology would mitigate libel damages, that&#8217;s  unlikely to hold much weight in any legal action concerning the stories  about Zoe Margolis or Facebook. Both Zoe and Facebook made their  reputation online and it&#8217;s online rather than in print that they have  the most to lose.As a Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian, a  traditional correction can&#8217;t undo the &#8216;brand damage that has been  done&#8217;. Perhaps, then, the Mail and the Independent should take a lesson  in damage control from Zoe. Moments after the Independent published  their apology, she tweeted out a link to it and asked her followers to  &#8216;please retweet&#8217;. Many (including me) did, and still others republished  it on their blogs. Not only did that spread the word that Zoe isn&#8217;t &#8211;  and has never been &#8211; a hooker, but it also helped ensure that most of  the Google results for &#8220;Zoe Margolis +hooker&#8221; point to the correction  and not to the original libel.Had the editors at the Mail and  the Independent been quicker to update their libellous URLs, and had they used  Twitter and other social networks to push out their apologies then  perhaps they could have avoided what will quite possibly be some very  costly legal action.But then again that would require them to  understand the first thing about the Internet and other &#8220;technical  matters&#8221;.

       "  'comments_content': 'According to a regulatory filing, LA-based Magento Commerce, which develops an open source e-commerce software suite, has recently received a $22.5 million capital injection in an equity funding round. Magento was originally a product developed and marketed by Varien, a 9-year old company that also delivers e-commerce business consulting and other services, but has now effectively been incorporated as a stand-alone venture. It&#8217;s unclear whether the financing of Magento comes from Varien, or if the latter company&#8217;s existing and / or other investors have stepped in to provide funding. Either way, the company says it concerns &#8216;fresh&#8217; cash.If I were to venture a guess, I would say PayPal plays a part in this story &#8211; from what I can gather the least you can say is that the digital payment company has a deep partnership with Magento that spans both co-marketing of their respective services as well as a collaboration on a product development level.I had a brief chat with Tim Schulz, the former MySpace product manager who recently became Magento&#8217;s Senior Product Manager, who told me they&#8217;re positioning the Magento Commerce solution right in the center of various growth areas in electronic commerce and that its goal is to become the provider of the single largest e-commerce platform in the world. Bonus points for showcasing some ambition.Magento currently has over 60,000 merchants using its software, which was downloaded about 1.5 million times as of January 2010. The company also says they&#8217;ve registered over $15 billion in transactions to date. The roadmap for the future is apparently paved with additional products, with a number of &#8220;Mobile Commerce, Saas offering and other products/services&#8221; coming later this year.Here&#8217;s a video of Varien / Magento CEO Roy Rubin outlining his vision on open source e-commerce:    CrunchBase Information',\n",

And it also brings with it big news for Bump Technologies, the startup that lets you exchange information simply by tapping smartphones together: Bump is now prominently featured in the PayPal iPhone application as a quick way to initiate transactions. Â\\xa0You can download the free app here.PayPal has offered a free application for the iPhone ever since the App Store launched in mid-2008, and it has gradually been improving over time.  Today&#8217;s release brings a handful of significant new features.  First, it now allows you to send a money request to your contacts (it&#8217;s essentially a bill).  Second, you can now withdraw money out of your PayPal account and deposit it into your bank account.  And there&#8217;s the Bump integration, which allows you to exchange money simply by tapping two iPhones together and entering the amount of the transaction â\\x80\\x94 finally, an easy way to collect money from those friends who always seem to be out of cash.The PayPal app includes a few more minor new features.  There&#8217;s now an integrated tip calculator and bill splitter, as well as a reminder function that alerts you when you need to send or withdraw money.  And the application now integrates the &#8216;PayPal For Kids&#8217; program, which allows kids and teenagers to access a PayPal sub-account that&#8217;s linked to their parent&#8217;s.PayPal&#8217;s iPhone app is only one component of the company&#8217;s mobile strategy.  Last spring it partnered with RIM for the launch of the BlackBerry App World store, and it has also integrated with eBay&#8217;s mobile application.  iPhone developers can easily integrate PayPal functionality using a PayPal library.  And aside from the iPhone app, it offers native PayPal applications for Android and RIM phones as well (the company plans to brings these apps up to speed with the new iPhone release over the next few months).This is also obviously very big news for Bump, which is still a young startup (the company took part in Y Combinator and was funded by Sequoia last fall). Bump and PayPal declined to disclose the details of the partnership.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When CoTweet sold to ExactTarget a couple weeks ago, the acquisition price was not disclosed.  But an SEC filing put out today suggests that ExactTweet paid at least $8.1 million in stock for CoTweet.  That is the value of &#8220;securities offered . . . as partial consideration in connection with a merger,&#8221; meaning there was likely a cash portion as well.  While this isn&#8217;t a huge sum, it&#8217;s not a terrible return for an initial investment of $1.1 million.CoTweet helps businesses manage multiple Twitter accounts and use it more effectively as marketing channel.  The CoTweet acquisition is now being pointed to as an example of how businesses can be built on top of Twitter.  So now we know how much the stock portion of the deal was worth.

       "  'comments_content': 'Before livestreaming video networks like Justin.TV  can become attractive to advertisers, they need to deal with their piracy issues.  It&#8217;s the same thing YouTube had to go through, except with live video streams.  Like YouTube, Justin.tv complies with DMCA takedown notices and is developing digital fingerprinting technology to identify copyrighted  video on its network automatically.  It also invites copyright owners to police the site directly.Despite these measures, a casual perusal of the most popular streams on Justin.tv is filled with pirated streams of professional sports, TV shows, and movies.  Right now, for instance, you can watch King of Queens or CNN International, taken straight from TV.  The company finds itself increasingly under fire for copyright issues.  To help it deal with these issues, Justin.tv now has a new adviser, Eric Goldman, the director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clare University and a highly-respected Internet law blogger.  Unlike Justin.TV&#8217;s very-expensive lawyers at Wilson Sonsini, Goldman will be less constrained in speaking publicly on behalf of the company about these issues.Goldman is an expert on how copyright law is applied to user-generated content.  But in many ways live video on the Web is a new beast.  It is hard for even a vigilant copyright holder to deliver a takedown notice if the video is only live on the Web for an hour.  Competitor Livestream takes a &#8220;Zero Tolerance Policy&#8221;  on piracy and challenges its competitors to do the same.  Livestream does pretty much the same things Justin.tv does to fight piracy, with one major exception: it limits new channels to 50 concurrent viewers until the channel is authorized manually as a legitimate channel. Should Justin.tv do the same thing?  Goldman dismisses Livestream&#8217;s zero tolerance policy as somewhat of a marketing pitch, but he thinks the concept of limiting a user&#8217;s &#8220;ability to put up content until they are proven trustworthy&#8221; is worth exploring.CEO Michael Seibel notes that Livestream can do that because it is pursuing more of an enterprise strategy than a consumer-driven one.  He also notes: &#8220;We work with the copyright owners. If copyright owners were not happy with us, they would be suing our pants off.&#8221;  So far, Justin.TV has not been sued in the U.S., while competitor Ustream cannot say the same.  Seibel sounds sincere when he tells me, &#8220;I donâ\\x80\\x99t want that content on my site.&#8221;  He really believes he can make money off the pure user-generated video, which costs him one third of a penny for every hour streamed, versus the half-a-penny per hour he can make just on remnant ads.But if Justin.tv is really serious about cleaning up the pirated streams on it network, why not simply police itself and strip the most questionable content from at least the most popular channels to start?  In the bizarro world of created by the DMCA, legally it can&#8217;t.  Under the DMCA, the responsibility for finding copyright violations lies with the copyright holders.  The second that a site starts to take on that responsibility itself, it risks losing the protection of the DMCA&#8217;s &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provision.  So Justin.TV can give copyright holders the tools to remove content from the site, but can&#8217;t do it themselves.   CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'During his keynote at SXSW this afternoon (live blog here), Twitter CEO Evan Williams just announced a new &#8220;At Anywhere&#8221; platform, which allows websites to more deeply integrate the service into their sites.  The idea is to offer a more seamless experience to Twitter users navigating third party sites like the Huffington Post and the New York Times, giving them Twitter content without forcing them to jump off the page they&#8217;re currently viewing. The details on the new platform are still scant, but this is Twitter&#8217;s answer to Facebook Connect, which we reported on back in January.Among the features:When you browse a site that uses @anywhere, people and brands that have Twitter accounts will be highlighted with a hyperlink.  Mousing over that hyperlink will show a small box (a &#8220;hovercard&#8221;) containing their Twitter information, including their most recent tweet (in effect it means you don&#8217;t have to click over to Twitter&#8217;s homepage to see their Twitter profile)Publishers will be able to more deeply integrate their own Twitter profiles, making them easier for their readers to &#8216;follow&#8217; themSites will be able to implement @anywhere with a few lines of Javascript.The new platform is launching with a number of major sites and services, including the New York Times, Huffington Post, Meebo, Amazon, Yahoo, Bing, and eBay.It looks like the platform may eventually be hosted at Twitter.com/anywhere, which currently features a placeholder Twitter account that tweeted &#8220;Stay Tuned&#8221;.  Update This may actually be a Twitter account related to the platform â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it just tweeted &#8220;If you&#8217;re a javascript guru and want to help us build @anywhere and work with publishers @jointheflock&#8221;.From the Twitter blog:Weâ\\x80\\x99ve developed a new set of frameworks for adding this Twitter experience anywhere on the web. Soon, sites many of us visit every day will be able to recreate these open, engaging interactions providing a new layer of value for visitors without sending them to Twitter.com. Our open technology platform is well known and Twitter APIs are already widely implemented but this is a different approach because weâ\\x80\\x99ve created something incredibly simple. Rather than implementing APIs, site owners need only drop in a few lines of javascript. This new set of frameworks is called @anywhere.When we&#8217;re ready to launch, initial participating sites will include Amazon, AdAge, Bing, Citysearch, Digg, eBay, The Huffington Post, Meebo, MSNBC.com, The New York Times, Salesforce.com, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Imagine being able to follow a New York Times journalist directly from her byline, tweet about a video without leaving YouTube, and discover new Twitter accounts while visiting the Yahoo! home pageâ\\x80\\x94and thatâ\\x80\\x99s just the beginning. Twitter has proven to be compelling in a variety of ways. With @anywhere, web site owners and operators will be able to offer visitors more value with less heavy lifting.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Williams may use the time to talk a bit about Twitter&#8217;s upcoming ad platform. Update: It&#8217;s actually an &#8220;At Platform&#8221; called At Anywhere &#8212; more here.Interestingly enough, Twitter saw its first burst of popularity three years ago at this very conference.Below find my live notes (paraphrased):UH: Ev you have something pretty interesting you want to say today?EW: Yeah, we want to announce something. We wanted to announce our new &#8220;At Platform&#8221; (undoubtedly to be spelled an @ Platform) &#8211; a way to integrate Twitter into any website. &#8220;At Anywhere&#8221; &#8211; basically this allows you to place the Twitter hovercards on any site. We have 13 sites we&#8217;re launching with including Amazon, ebay, Yahoo, Digg, Bing, Meebo, Salesforce.UH: So what can you do with this?EW: You can easily tweet from any page that is using this. Also, maybe you want talk to authors of posts without going to Twitter itself, you can just hover over their name and tweet them. Twitter is a very easy way to keep in touch.UH: So this helps you contextualize information. But why would sites use this?EW: A connection to users you didn&#8217;t have before &#8211; and it keeps people coming back. And it will result in more followers for a site. Also, hopefully more people who are your fans using twitter to talk about you or your content. And you can bring in users&#8217; tweets talking about your site.UH: So it&#8217;s a platform to juice up site&#8217;s networks and virility. But it&#8217;s an &#8220;At Platform&#8221; not an &#8220;Ad Platform&#8221;.EW: Yeah, it&#8217;s about lowering the barrier for information.UH: What makes 21st century businesses different? Like Twitter? The first principle to me is experimentation. Why are you willing to explore different possibilities?EW: Experimentation lets you create value. &#8220;Whatever you assume when you start out, you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221; Most of the great businesses of our time have experimented. Like Google.UH: So it&#8217;s about creating value, then figuring it out?EW: Yes, it&#8217;s about creating experience for users and businesses. There is a ton of business use on Twitter today &#8212; it&#8217;s one of the biggest uses. We want to make that better, easier, faster.UH: What is Twitter evolving to?EW: What is Twitter has always been a tough question to answer. We think of it as an information network &#8212; different from a social network. It&#8217;s about getting info and also sharing. You can take advantage of Twitter without sharing anything about your life. We need to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.UH: So better information, better connections, better choices.EW: Yes.UH: Experimentation is about iteration. So how does that happen at Twitter?EW: We have a bunch of awesome people in the company now. We&#8217;ve grown very quickly over the past year. Our employee growth curve is almost like our user growth curve now. We have people on focused teams, like mobile, or internationalization. We&#8217;re worried about central thinking and slow processes. So we tell our teams to &#8220;go for it.&#8221;UH: So what&#8217;s your role?EW: I don&#8217;t get into the nuts and bolts of code, cause things would be a big mess. I spend most of my time thinking about the high level issues. And I think a lot about the company &#8211; how do we scale the company, about our culture, etc. How do we define the characteristics we want. I think there is a parallel between the service and the company &#8212; openness is huge, transparency. UH: So openness is very important. Help us trace the arc of openness at Twitter.EW: Yeah, it means a lot of things. We debated if openness or transparency. &#8220;A window is transparent, but a door is open.&#8221; The users have taken Twitter and morphed it into what they want it to be. Now developers are doing the same thing. Openness is really a survival technique.I sit down with new employees when they start and go over 9 assumptions you should have about working at Twitter. One key one is assume there are more smart people outside the company than insides.UH: What about giving the golden goose away? Why be so open?EW: That was a big question for us &#8211; the deals with Bing and Google. These were the first guys we shared our full stream with. There&#8217;s a lot of debate about that. Because we don&#8217;t have a business model yet, so why give it away? But we went back to the principle of giving users the most value. There are 50 million tweets a day, how do we show you the best ones for you? Right now, we don&#8217;t do a good enough job of that. But with these partnerships, we have more chances to do that.UH: Was there a lot of internal debate about this?EW: Yeah, there was a ton. But we decided it was good. And now we&#8217;ve expanded the deals &#8211; like with Yahoo. And a few weeks ago we talked about giving this data to thousands of others. Now third party developers are building a lot of value. Like adding pictures to Twitter.CoTweet and HootSuite are really interesting too. Twitter.com isn&#8217;t a good interface for doing customer support, but those guys are. CoTweet just got acquired by a company that wants to focus on that more.We&#8217;d love to see much more focus on creating these deep experiences that create value.UH: So experimentation and openness. Other companies want control, like Apple. How open are you guys?EW: We&#8217;re pretty open &#8211; there is some control we need to employ because if we were infinitely open we&#8217;d be doing a disservice to users. Openness can work against you still. It has to be managed a lot. Having an open API makes it easier to make apps that will spam users. We send cease and desists everyday to companies making spam tools. We have to exert some control.UH: I think shepherding is a good way to put it. So you had some interesting use recently &#8211; such as the earthquake in Chile.EW: I got an email recently about the earthquake, thanking us for helping with the situation. This is very gratifying for us because we&#8217;ve always held it important for Twitter to reach the weakest signals in the world. We started out with a big focus on SMS &#8211; and it&#8217;s still really important to us. Because it reaches so many people. We have deals with 65 carriers around the world to send these SMS tweets.We&#8217;re at the beginning. We&#8217;re seeing really strong growth in India where SMS is huge. And in the Middle East.UH: I think this changing the world stuff is the future for entrepreneurs. It gets to the heart of the point about inclusiveness. So &#8211; what is an &#8220;active user&#8221;?EW: To me it comes back to &#8211; is someone getting value out of Twitter? If they don&#8217;t have an account it&#8217;s hard to know, like people who search Google for tweets. In the beginning we put a lot of focus on telling the world or your friends and family what you&#8217;re doing. But now there is something interesting on Twitter for everyone &#8211; like the Flaming Lips being on Twitter, you can get updates on the band.And as more people start getting information on Twitter, they&#8217;re more likely to get involved.UH: Someone has started using Twitter inside the White House, right?EW: Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting that it&#8217;s from in the White House. It&#8217;s an official channel, but they&#8217;re using it a different type of way. It&#8217;s about reducing the walls between people with a lot of influence, and those who they influence. And that&#8217;s the most profound promise of the Internet. This is the wave I started on 10 years ago with blogging. It&#8217;s about the democracy of information. Anyone can put information on the web &#8212; that&#8217;s huge.UH: Tweet Minister in the UK aggregates the tweets from members of parliament. This is re-wiring society in some ways. But we also have a counter-force &#8211; like state control of information.EW: In some regions, yes, this is bad and hurting the web. But the Internet is a tidal wave that you will not be able to keep out. Like in China, who knows how long those firewalls will hold up &#8211; but not forever.UH: Yes, there are many ways to get through the firewalls already. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure on them.Let&#8217;s talk about &#8220;betterness.&#8221; I booked a trip to his five star resort in an exotic land. When I got there, it was a shack. The manager couldn&#8217;t do anything &#8212; so I put it on Twitter. Within 15 minutes the booking company called me, and in 20 minutes I got a new hotel. In a half an hour my vacation was fixed.EW: That&#8217;s great. Our hope is that this is the norm, not a fluke. We have a bit of a dichotomy, because there is more everyday you want to search for. We don&#8217;t just want to maximize that, we hope to make Twitter more useful to you. We want to decrease time you spend on Twitter, not increase it. Recently we went through a process to define our operating principles. The number one principle is &#8220;be a force for good.&#8221; Another principle is &#8220;pay attention.&#8221;UH: David Pogue did a campaign against hidden charges from the carriers. It&#8217;s the same thing with the hotel operator and me. I know you&#8217;re a big fan of Warren Buffet &#8211; he also believes in creating real value.EW: Yes, from a business perspective, Twitter needs to fundamentally be about helping people make better decisions. Or the help something happen that normally wouldn&#8217;t. Like the donations to Haiti through text message &#8212; we weren&#8217;t taking the money, but it spread virally through Twitter. People want to help each other out, we need to reduce the friction.UH: Is that what you want to do with the new At Platform?EW: Yes, totally. We&#8217;ll see what happens, the obvious stuff is more tweeting, but I think it&#8217;s a lowering of the friction as well.UH: You ask yourself, how would i make Walmart better? Why ask yourself that?EW: Because as we look at how businesses are using Twitter &#8211; we want our tool to help businesses get better. The world is so often a black box where there is no communication. There&#8217;s a lack of dialogue and a lack of transparency. The promise of all these technologies is that this goes away. You close the loop.UH: Outline for us your big picture goals.EW: Fostering the open exchange of information. To be a force for good. The ease of exchange of information is important. Help out other people with something as small as a retweet. That&#8217;s our ambition.UH: Google is all about archiving the world&#8217;s information. Yours is different &#8212; creating new information.It&#8217;s all about advantage though &#8211; what&#8217;s your advantage.EW: Our advantage will only come if everyone wins. We only do win-win deals. Because any deal where someone is losing is unsustainable. That&#8217;s why we haven&#8217;t turned on the revenue yet &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of low-hanging fruit, but none of it is sustainable. Creating an advantage for other people and not giving them a reason to work around you &#8211; that&#8217;s key.UH: Is the Internet making a better media industry?EW: I think there&#8217;s a huge shift going on &#8211; but it&#8217;s an ecosystem where everything is involved. This user-generated content just makes things richer. Blogging and traditional media work together. Twitter compliments traditional media. I was talking last night to some guys from CNN &#8211; it&#8217;s helped them change what they do. It&#8217;s a win-win.UH: How will the At Platform speak to that?EW: Hopefully these guys will us it to get the new out there.UH: What makes you tick?EW: There are two types of entrepreneurs. What drives me is creating things that didn&#8217;t exist before. Your product or service should be at the end of the sentence: &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if&#8230;&#8221;It&#8217;s creating new stuff versus extracting from old stuff. There are people who look at money as the goal versus the teams. I create businesses to make new things. It&#8217;s a fuel for creating more things in the world. I&#8217;ve been lucky to stumble upon things that have helped change the world.UH: Why focus on these things though?EW: Largely luck. But maybe it&#8217;s what interests me. Twitter was a side project of Odeo &#8211; my cofounders came up with it. Blogging was a side project too at one point.UH: If something is awesome, people will use it. EW: Yes.Also, helping others succeed is a sub principle of ours.UH: Tell us one or two more of them.EW: Be a force for good, pay attention &#8212; make things happen is another one. There&#8217;s also building a culture of trust.UH: What are your big lessons to other entrepreneurs?EW: Create something you want to exist in the world. Another is focus. Many people are trying to do a lot of things when they should be doing one thing. You may be wrong with whatever you&#8217;re trying out, but you&#8217;ll try other things. A lot of the great companies are now coming from outside Silicon Valley. You don&#8217;t have to be there.That&#8217;s a wrap.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;re in the midst of full-on location war is raging this year at SXSW in Austin, Texas this year. But actually, someone has already won: AT&amp;T.Yes, despite my concerns, I&#8217;m happy to report that the network has been incredibly stable over the past several days. In fact, it&#8217;s the best I&#8217;ve ever seen AT&amp;T&#8217;s network perform â\\x80\\x94 anywhere. Over the past three days I haven&#8217;t dropped one call, haven&#8217;t missed one voicemail, haven&#8217;t been missed any text messages, and the data is flowing freely, allowing my iPhone to actually work.The fact that AT&amp;T is actually working like a network you pay $100-a-month for is notable because last year at the same conference, AT&amp;T suffered a complete and utter meltdown. Strained to the point of pretty much continuous failure under the weight of smart phones (and yes, the iPhone in particular), AT&amp;T had to hustle to bring in backup systems to get the network at least somewhat working over the last few days of the interactive part of the conference last year.This year, as I detailed last week, they had an elaborate plan of action in place before the conference. And it appears to be working perfectly.While I&#8217;m thrilled that I can actually use my iPhone this year, AT&amp;T&#8217;s success in Austin also makes me wonder: why on Earth can&#8217;t they do this in San Francisco? Or New York City? Sure, those cities are much larger than the relatively small amount of ground they have to cover in Austin, but why not just bring in more of these Cells on Wheels (the so-called COWS), or do any of the other tweaks they&#8217;ve done here?AT&amp;T has said it has been doing things throughout the past year to try to fix the network in these cities, but despite some mild improvements here and there, most will agree, the overall network is still awful. Hell, even AT&amp;T agrees. But whatever they&#8217;re doing in Austin is working to perfection. Yes, it&#8217;s a temporary solution, but who cares? Put this temporary solution in place in San Francisco and New York until you fix the underlying problems.Obviously, AT&amp;T has likely run through every scenario for fixing its network in these cities, so I can only guess it&#8217;s a question of money. The problem is that now that we know AT&amp;T is capable of fixing its network, they&#8217;re going to have a much harder time saying something like, &#8220;we&#8217;re working on it.&#8221; Just do it.AT&amp;T, you done one hell of a job in Austin this week, shutting me up in the process. Now shut me up about the rest of the network too. Please.[photo: flickr/dl the huntress]',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'All naysaying aside, people are pretty excited about Windows Phone 7. Our readers are excited for it. I&#8217;d be outright lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t excited about it, too. Know who else is excited? The Windows Phone 7 team &#8212; but perhaps not for the reasons you&#8217;d expect.With a few years of work finally coming to a head, some of the folks on the Windows Phone 7 team are taking a step back, looking at the fruits of their labor&#8230; and leaving. Not because they&#8217;re ashamed, and not because they&#8217;re being poached by the competition &#8212; but because instead of making Windows Phone 7, they want to make things for Windows Phone 7.Earlier today, we received an anonymous tip that Microsoft Program Manager Mel Sampat was leaving Microsoft to do just that. After being one of the main voices behind the Windows Mobile blog for 4 years and helping to build the Calendar interface in Windows Phone 7, Mel Sampat (or &#8220;MelSam&#8221;, as he&#8217;s more commonly known) said in a letter to the team (see below) that he was departing to found mist labs, a company focusing on &#8220;helping big brands port their iPhone investments over to WM7&#8243; along with a few original apps of their own. The company&#8217;s placeholder page also shows iPhone and Android handsets, implying that WM7 might not necessarily be the sole focus for them.According to the tipster, MelSam isn&#8217;t alone; at least 6 other employees (who went unnamed) have recently left the team now that the product is almost out the door, many of whom seem to be interested in their own gigs rather than making the standard move to the competition.Sampat&#8217;s letter follows:Hey guysafter 4 amazing years in this team, I&#8217;ve decided to shake things up a bit. I&#8217;m leaving Microsoft and my last day will be Mar 12. Wtf? Well, as some of you know, I was an ISV before coming to Microsoft, and made a decent living writing Pocket PC apps way back in the good old days when we were kicking ass with WM5. After seeing the great reception 7 has received, the dormant entrepreneur in me has resurrected with a huge urge to write apps again. I see an opportunity in a few original ideas I have, as well as helping big brands port their iPhone investments over to WM7. So I&#8217;m starting a new company and hope to have some cool WM7 stuff &#8220;ready in time for holiday 2010&#8243;.It&#8217;s been a pleasure &#038; honor to work alongside so many of you. I will support Microsoft from the outside, and wish nothing but the best for 7. Thanks again for your friendship, comradry and &#8220;teachable moments&#8221; since 2006. Stay in touch and feel free to drop me a line if you ever need the ISV perspective on something. I leave my features in the able hands of Steve May and the rest of the Time Management team, who deserve credit for the Calendar experience I helped build.How to find me:[Removed]See you down the road.-MelSamCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Startup Seesmic  has perfected the art of developing compelling Twitter clients on a variety of platforms. Seesmic offers a web client, an Adobe Air-powered desktop client, an Android app, a BlackBerry app, a brand friendly Twitter client and a native Windows desktop client. At developer conference MIX today, Seesmic founder Loic Le Meur is announcing a new Silverlight-powered development platform and Seesmic for the Windows Phone. The new desktop platform from Seesmic is built based off of Silverlight, which is a refreshing change from the buggy Adobe Air platform. The design itself is similar in look and feel to the Windows client, and includes functionality for integrating your Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin accounts. You can also personalize your background of the app. And the new platform works on both Macs and PCs. But the most compelling feature of the new desktop platform is that it was designed with plugin features, which will now allows developers build features or integrate their services in Seesmic&#8217;s suite of Seesmic clients. One example of a plugin feature  is a Bing mapping control plugin, which not only allows you to track geo-location but integrates trackable links at Bing.comThe Seesmic Desktop SDK includes an Extensibility layer as well as a set of utility classes, and the accompanying documentation. Seesmic is also launching a Twitter client app for Windows phones, similar to the BlackBerry app, that will integrated Bing maps and geo-location together. Le Meur has told me in the past that he has invested in the Windows platform because 80 percent of Seesmic users use a PC. But with the new Silverlight-powered client, both Mac and PC users will be able to experience the client. I&#8217;m curious how the client will far against rival technology Adobe Air powered clients, which include Seesmic, and Tweetdeck. And Le Meur is wise to create an ecosystem around his applications, allowing developers to create plug-ins for Seesmic clients.

       "  'comments_content': 'Facing competition from recently acquired AdMob (Google) and Quattro Wireless (Apple), mobile ad network Mobclix has been steadily working to strengthen its products and offerings. The startup just acquired iPhone app sales analytics software Heartbeat and announced a deal to offer Nielsenâ\\x80\\x99s ad targeting data into its ad exchange to enhance ad targeting. Today, Mobclix is officially launching one of the first SDKs for iPad advertising.  Apple&#8217;s new tablet device, which will be delivered to consumers in a few weeks, poses a tremendous opportunity for advertising. The size of the tablet not only allows for larger ad sixes but ads can also be more engaging and media rich, with the possibility of incorporating video and other interactive features. And these means more revenue for advertisers and developers. Mobclix allows app developers to sign up with their ad inventory and ad networks bid for the spots based on age, gender, location, and other factors. The ads being served change automatically, based on which ad network is bidding the highest to reach the users of that particular app. It also lets advertisers buy across a variety of apps based on demographic, geo-targeting, and behavioral characteristics. Mobclix ripped its iPhone SDK apart and completely rebuilt a new SDK for the iPad. The startup says that thew new iPad advertising opportunities means higher eCPMs and more options for ad sizes. Currently Mobclix partners Traffic Marketplace and Valueclick are offering the 300&#215;250 ad unit for the iPad. But Mobclix will be launching 468 x 60, 120 x 600, 728 x 90 formats by April. Of course it should be interesting to see how Apple&#8217;s own mobile ad network, Quattro Wireless, will play into the advertising ecosystem on the iPad. While it&#8217;s unclear what Apple&#8217;s plans are for Quattro, we do know that Apple is bullish on mobile advertising and may be developing its own mobile advertising offerings for developers. And, Quattro Wireless is one of the networks that is included in Mobclix&#8217;s exchange. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m here in Austin, Texas, where MOG CEO David Hyman is introducing the service&#8217;s new mobile functionality. This is a major step for MOG, and may be an inflection point in the success of the service.  Up until now, users have been restricted to using MOG&#8217;s streaming music service on their computers.   That&#8217;s fine for casual listening at work, but as we&#8217;ve seen with the success of the mobile versions of Pandora, users want mobile.  And that&#8217;s what MOG is unveiling today. Read below for my notes.Hyman kicked off the talk with some background information. MOG Music Network, the editorial-based site hosted at MOG.com, reaches 16 million unique visitors a month. In December, the company launched Mog All Access, its streaming music service that costs $5/month for all-you-can-eat streaming music.  The company is getting 17% conversion from its 3 day free trial (which is high).  MOG, Hyman says, is a music service people will actually pay for.  But the key will be portability.MOG&#8217;s mobile applications for Android and iPhone will launch in Q2, featuring on-demand streams, downloads, MOG Radio, your library and playlists, High Quality audio, and a $10/month price tag (which includes both mobile and the web version of the service).First, MOG showcased its Android application.  As with the desktop version of MOG, users can stream any song on demand (they can also edit their playlists and upcoming song queue).  Along with playlists and individual songs, users can also tap into MOG Radio, which generates a playlist of songs based on one of your favorite artists, albums, or songs (it&#8217;s a bit like Pandora, but you can dynamically adjust the content of your station using a slider and can jump to new songs as many times as you&#8217;d like).  One other very slick feature: on Android, the service will feature voice commands, so you can simply say the name of the artist you&#8217;re looking for.Next, MOG showed off the company&#8217;s iPhone application.  In general, MOG is looking to keep the interfaces of the iPhone and Android applications consistent. Â\\xa0From a feature perspective, the iPhone and Android applications are identical (save for the Android voice search), and the applications are being developed side by side.Offline PlaybackAll of MOG&#8217;s on-demand streaming functionality looks great, but the killer feature is offline downloading.  Using this, users can tap on a song or album they like and choose to download it to their iPhone or Android device, allowing you to seamlessly use the application when your phone doesn&#8217;t have connectivity.  Hyman says that other offline services that have caching just cache your playlists â\\x80\\x94 MOG lets you select any playlist or album on the site and immediately begin downloading it.Â\\xa0Mobile web streaming and downloads will default t0 64kb AAC+ but users have the option to download 320kb/s files (which would obviously take much longer. Â\\xa0Streaming and downloading works over Wi-Fi, 3G, and EDGE.Regarding whether or not MOG was worried Apple would turn down the application, Hyman said that historically Apple has allowed other subscription-based applications that feature local caching (he alluded to Spotify, which was previously accepted by Apple). But as always, nothing is certain with the App Store.MOG will be facing off with plenty of competitors.  Last fall, Spotify released applications for both iPhone and Android, but the service still isn&#8217;t available stateside.  Pandora has become very popular on mobile devices, but it doesn&#8217;t let you play any song you&#8217;d like on demand (it&#8217;s free, so plenty of people are willing to overlook that).  From a feature perspective, Rhapsody is most similar to MOG (especially once it gets offline playback for its iPhone application, which is coming soon), but it&#8217;s $15 a month compared to MOG&#8217;s $10.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The goal is to provide early-stage startups with seed financing, ranging from 100k to $1 million and fund companies with up to $10 million on an annual basis for the next 10 years. In addition to investing capital, Lightbank intends to take an active role in guiding and nurturing companies through all stages of growth.With the new fund, the entrepreneurs want to help establish Chicago as a technology hub and support the heaps of &#8220;untapped entrepreneurial talent&#8221; they claim the city is filled with. If you think that applies to you, find out how to apply here.Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell met at the University of Michigan. In 2001, Lefkofsky founded InnerWorkings, a print and procurement company that was taken public in 2006. In 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell started Echo Global Logistics, a transportation and logistics management company that went public in 2009. In 2006, the pair co-founded MediaBank, a data-driven media-buying platform that they claim now processes nearly 20 percent of the media purchased annually in the United States. In 2007, they seeded and co-founded Groupon, a collective buying site that now operates in over 40 cities, has more than three million subscribers and has raised close to $36 million from New Enterprise Associates and Accel Partners.Between the two of them, Lefkofsky and Keywell claim to have raised over $150 million in capital for their ventures, and generated more than $1.5 billion in investor returns.We&#8217;re looking forward to tracking which investments their new fund will be used for.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Seattle-based Vittana is taking a similar approach to helping fund education in developing countries by allowing you to lend directly to students in the developing world. The idea is to bring student loans to the developing world through the power of person-to-person microlending. Today, the site is existing its beta period. Vittana partners with microfinance organizations located in developing countries to donate to students in need of funding. Loans for students range from $200 to $1,500, are then funded by individual lenders, via $25 donations or more, on the Vittana website. One hundred percent of the loans are given to the student. Launched in beta last May, the Vittana community has made over $110,000 in loans to nearly 200 students around the world, who are now getting their degrees. Thus far, Vittana has programs in Mongolia, Nicaragua, Paraguay Peru and Vietnam and plans to expand to India and countries in Africa soon. And Vittana students have had a 97 percent repayment rate. The non-profit organization, which was founded by former Amazon employee Kushal Chakrabarti  and Brett Witt,  was incubated in the fbFund REV program. Vittana has received funding from a number of notable investors and leaders in the technology space including Mike Murray, Mitch Kapor, Joel Spiegel,  Dave McClure, and Dave Richards. Qifang is implementing a similar model for education in China.  Vittana launching a Microfinance Madness initiative (think March Madness meets microfinance) to help bring together bloggers, college students, startups and other groups in a competition to lend the most money to college students around the world. TechCrunch is participating in the initiative and will be facing The Huffington Post, Redfin and others to raise funds. Join our group and make your donation today!CrunchBase Information',\n",

Ning Networks span every area of human endeavor, from the arts to business, politics to social activism, and every other field you can think of.  Over 5,000 new Ning Networks are created every day, and we&#8217;re adding a million new registered users every 12 daysOver the past year, Ning&#8217;s unique worldwide visitors have doubled to 20.7 million, according to comScore, which is still much smaller than other social networks such as Hi5 (46.5 million) or LinkedIn (42.8 million).  But at least it&#8217;s bigger than Friendster&#8217;s 15 million.

       "  'comments_content': 'As Apple goes on the offensive against Android, it risks alienating more and more developers.  Today, another prominent developer chose the opposing side.  Tim Bray, the well-known software architect and blogger, is joining Google to help rally even more developers around the Android mobile operating system.  Bray is the co-inventor of the XML Web standard, and most recently worked at Sun Microsystems. In a blog post, he explains that he is drawn to Google in part because he hates the iPhone, or at least its closed and controlling environment from a developer&#8217;s perspective.The iPhone vision of the mobile Internetâ\\x80\\x99s future omits controversy, sex, and freedom, but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers. The people who create the apps serve at the landlordâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure and fear his anger.I hate it.He also notes that Android is catching up to the iPhone in terms of sales:As of now, theyâ\\x80\\x99re selling around 90K iPhones per day compared to around 60K Android handsets. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a horse race! In February, Google noted partners are selling 60,000 Android handsets a day, and Apple sold 8.7 million iPhones last quarter, or about 97,000 a day.  Android is making steady gains in market share.Bray&#8217;s decision to throw his hat into the Android ring is just the latest example of a growing backlash among developers to Apple&#8217;s autocratic ways.  Facebook developer Joe Hewitt famously quit the iPhone over similar issues.  Apple cannot afford to alienate developers because, given the choice, they will shift their attention and their apps to other platforms.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock for the last couple months, you know that Toyota has had problems with sudden acceleration of some of its vehicles. Apparently, the root cause of the problem is still unknown, which is a little troubling to the average consumer.  Toyota claims to be doing everything they can to investigate, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be enough. Now everyone and their brother are suddenly product design engineers and have the gall to tell Toyota what to do and how to do it.Witness this opinion piece in the LA Times by David M. Cummings entitled &#8220;Haven&#8217;t found that software glitch, Toyota? Keep trying&#8220;. Mr. Cummings worked on the Mars Pathfinder project for NASA, so he has some credibility to his name when it comes to software design and product testing. But his opinion piece seems to completely miss the point of the PR nightmare that Toyota is dealing with. Mr. Cummings says &#8220;I&#8217;m still skeptical when I hear an engineer declare a complex software system to be bug-free based on laboratory testing.&#8221; I admit I haven&#8217;t been following the Toyota situation very closely, but I&#8217;d be floored if anyone at Toyota has gone on record to say that the millions of lines of embedded software used in Toyota vehicles is &#8220;bug free&#8221;. I&#8217;d be surprised if any professional software developer anywhere would have the gall to claim any code bug free. Code is complex. The systems on which the code runs are complex. The number of variables affecting the execution of that code are even more complex.As Mr. Cummins observes at the beginning of his rant, &#8220;Toyota&#8217;s chief engineer testified to Congress that the company has done extensive testing on its cars&#8217; electronics and believes they are not the cause of the sudden acceleration.&#8221; To claim that the software is not the cause of the sudden acceleration is not the same thing as claiming that the software is completely free of bugs!What really sticks in my craw about Mr. Cummins complaint, though, is that he doesn&#8217;t appear to appreciate the audience that Toyota is addressing. Sure, some of the people following this situation are engineers, and they may well be interested in the details of the testing methodologies, or specifics of lab results; but most people are average consumers with no interest whatsoever in the science of this issue. They just want to know that the problem has been identified and fixed.When I provide technical support to people, I don&#8217;t go into the specifics of memory registers, or heap and stack overflows, or any of the other things that happen to cause problems. I tell people that something went wrong in very simple terms. They trust me to know what I&#8217;m doing, else they wouldn&#8217;t have asked me to help them to begin with. They don&#8217;t want to get into the nitty gritty, else they&#8217;d pursue a job in technology on their own. I think Mr. Cummins needs to remember that not every Toyota owner, and certainly not every member of the U.S. Congress, is an engineer, or has an engineer&#8217;s mentality.Mr. Cummins final remarks are very sound, though: &#8220;this should serve as a wake-up call to all industries that increasingly rely on software for safety.&#8221; I agree whole-heartedly. The world is only going to continue to get more complex. We need to build safety and reliability testing into every facet of product design, and not trust the tool chains we use to build software.',\n",

With so many mobile phone movie apps, it&#8217;s easy to find what&#8217;s playing at nearby theaters and even purchase tickets right from your mobile phone, but then you still have to get a paper ticket from the dispenser or the ticket agent.  But your ticket could easily be delivered to your mobile phone via a 2D barcode.Today, Fandango is launching a mobile ticket program in eight cities which lets moviegoers finally go paperless.  Your ticket is delivered to your mobile phone via an SMS or MMS message linked to a 2D barcode, which the ticket-takers can scan.  Movie theaters need to equip their attendees with special scanners, which is why it is only available in a few markets.

       "  'comments_content': 'Between the geolocation wars of Facebook and Twitter and the flux of geolocation-based social networks and mobile apps that have been  hitting the market recently, the competition is tough. Today, mobile networking startup  NearVerse, is launching a free iPhone app, called LoKast, which allows people to share media between iPhones at super-fast speeds. The kicker: the app connects people in its network based on proximity. LoKast, which is actually short for â\\x80\\x9clocal-casting,&#8221; allows you to set up a profile that will list all of your photos, selected contacts, videos, web links and music on your mobile phone. You can select which content you&#8217;d like to include to the public and which content you&#8217;d like to keep private. When a LoKast user is in proximity (300 feet) of other LoKast users, the app will automatically discover other users nearby and allow the user to view and download their  content.  For example, you can see the iTunes library of any user who is in close proximity to you. You can choose to download a 30-second clip of any song to your own profile and can also follow the link to the iTunes store to purchase the music (LoKast collects an affiliate fee for this, of course). Similarly, you can download photos, videos and even contacts from other users into your profile. You&#8217;ll also soon be able to share apps on your phone with other users. The beauty of Lokast is that it has its own internal network; eliminating the need for 3G connectivity to run the app, as LoKast works in subways, underground and heavily congested areas such as stadiums, where 3G connectivity is unreliable. The startup&#8217;s app is effectively all network based and currently has five patents for its proprietary technology. LoKast is also partnering with bands to help market their content to users. LoKast has struck deals with music distribution companies including The Orchard, IODA and Monalis 360 to provide users with exclusive content within the LoKast app. And production companies, such as Mark Cubanâ\\x80\\x99s Magnolia Pictures, are also using the service to promote their new films.LoKast will soon be launching an Android app, and plans to launch integration with Facebook Connect. The app itself is incredibly simple to use and seems like it has potential to be a great way to share content on your mobile phone. Of course, some people may not feel comfortable sharing their personal content to complete strangers, so that may be a barrier for certain users. CrunchBase Information',\n",

We&#8217;ll of course be covering any announcements that will be made by Williams on stage, but we expect that at least part of the keynote address will be centered around the company&#8217;s advertising platform.Update: please refer to our live blog from the Williams keynote address, and the details of the announced &#8216;At Anywhere&#8217; platform.Twitter made a memorable splash at SXSW three years ago, and will likely have opted for the conference as the right place to detail its digital advertising plans, which it hopes will become a major source of revenue in addition to its realtime search outsourcing deals with major Internet players like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, which are said to have already turned the company profitable on an operational basis.Just for reference: the company also switched the flip on the geolocation feature for its website in time for SXSW.Nobody knows for sure whether Twitter will effectively be launching its proprietary ad platform today, but there&#8217;s a good chance it will, at least to a subset of advertisers. The companyâ\\x80\\x99s head of monetization, Anamitra Banerji, stated as much during a talk at an advertising industry panel on 22 February when he said Twitter&#8217;s online ad platform would debut in beta form &#8216;in a month or so&#8217;.In addition, GigaOM&#8217;s Mathew Ingram at the time cited a source from the media industry who said Twitter was working with several major partners for the imminent launch, including â\\x80\\x9cnew and traditional mediaâ\\x80\\x9d.We &#8211; and others &#8211; have speculated before about what Twitter ads could or should look like and last November, Twitter COO Dick Costolo told us at our Realtime Crunchup that the new ads will be â\\x80\\x9cfascinating&#8221;, &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; and that &#8220;people will love it&#8221;. I&#8217;ve yet to come across any form of digital advertising that people truly love, and Twitter is tricky territory for advertising as it revolves primarily around personal, direct communication between individuals. It isn&#8217;t anything like putting display ads up on a newspaper site (or even a social network), or matching search keywords with relevant text ads. I&#8217;m very curious to find out what will be so non-traditional and fascinating about Twitter&#8217;s ad model, and if they&#8217;ve effectively been able to come up with a way that will prove both beneficial for online advertisers and non-disruptive for its many millions of users throughout the world. I&#8217;m also looking forward to April, when Twitter will likely be outlining its revenue strategy with third-party developers at its first ever Chirp conference.My (educated) guess is we&#8217;ll know more this afternoon &#8211; William&#8217;&#8217;s keynote starts at 2 PM.(Image via eHow)CrunchBase Information',\n",

Here&#8217;s another testament to that notion: KIT digital this morning announced that it has agreed to acquire privately-held competitor Multicast Media for net consideration of approximately $18 million. The acquisition sum is comprised of $4.9 million in cash and 1.3 million shares of KIT digital common stock, plus the assumption of approximately $4.6 million in long-term liabilities.KIT digital plans to close the acquisition by the end of this month.This is KIT digital&#8217;s sixth strategic acquisition, following the purchases of Narrowstep, Visual Connection, Morpheum, Kamera, The Feedroom and Nunet (the latter two brands were retired by KIT digital late 2009).Multicast specializes in live event broadcasting, Internet video management and targeted multimedia communications for about 1,000 organizations ranging from government, non-profit organizations to Fortune 500 companies. In 2009, Multicast claims to have delivered broadcasts for some 50,000 live events and served more than 250 million video streams to a worldwide audience.The company is said to derive an estimated $12 million in annualized recurring licensing fees for its IP video management software, with additional revenues related to professional services.From what we can gather, Multicast has never publicly talked about how much funding it raised and when, although it is listed as a portfolio company of Northbrook, Illinois based MK Capital.KIT digital will be integrating Media Suite&#8217;s live and content delivery solutions onto its VX-one platform, and expects to host Multicast&#8217;s clients operating on a unified platform by the third quarter of 2010. Several Multicast executives will be transitioning to KIT digital&#8217;s global management team and the company&#8217;s offices in Atlanta, Georgia will continue to be staffed by 90+ Multicast employees.Concurrent with the Multicast acquisition, KIT digital announced that it has acquired or agreed to acquire nearly 4 million of its outstanding in-the-money warrants over the course of the first quarter, using the proceeds from its recent $15 million public equity offering.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The Brightcove platform will enable EMI Music to create customized viewing experiences, including country and language-specific video experiences for its Web properties, and expand the reach of its video content through SEO, social sharing tools and a range of third-party distribution capabilities. EMI Music will also be able to tap into Brightcove&#8217;s monetization and analytics tools in order to open up new revenue streams through online video advertising.Brightcove recently scored a few big wins in Europe as well, signing up the U.K.&#8217;s Virgin Media and a number of customers in Spain ranging from publishers Conde Nast Digital Spain and Grupo V to video and music providers TQMadrid and Sony Music Spain. It doesn&#8217;t win all battles, though: rival Ooyala recently took over as lead provider of an online video distribution platform for the Telegraph Media Group.Also check out Michael Arrington&#8217;s video interview with Brightcove CEO Jeremy Allaire in Davos from earlier this year.(Via press release)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Media and legal news pundit Dan Abrams is expanding his Mediaite, mini-empire today with the launch of fashion news site Styleite. Abrams announced late last year that he has a definitive plan for expanding to other verticals, and most recently launched tech and geek culture site Geekosystem. Styleite is the Mediaite family&#8217;s venture into fashion journalism, with a little edge and pop culture stirred in. The site covers the news of what&#8217;s taking place in the industry and focuses on a blend of analysis and breaking news. Stories range from Amy Winehouse&#8217;s new designs to Yves Saint Laurent&#8217;s latest exhibition to Lady Gaga&#8217;s best fashion moments in her latest music video. The site also features a fashion industry-focused Power Grid which is Mediaite&#8217;s trademark feature for ranking individuals and execs in various industries. The technology will rank 3,000 models, brands, execs, designers, reporters and others in the fashion industry based upon their power and media exposure weekly. But Styleite aims to more than just a fashion news and analysis destination; the site also wants to be a fashion community. Styleite includes a feature , which is similar in theory to Like.com&#8217;s Weardrobe, that allows users to create a profile and upload photos of their outfits and then tag their photos with the brands and styles that they are wearing at the time. The aim is to socialize user generated content around fashion and engage visitors in the art of styling their clothes. Abrams has seen considerable success with Mediaite since its launch last year, with the site making Technoratiâ\\x80\\x99s top 40 blogs list. Mediaite also expects to turn profitable this year as well. And Styleite may be able to draw a different demographic than the media and tech focused sites. I&#8217;m a fan of fashion-focused news sites incorporating social media and community creating tools into their platforms and I think Styliete could end up helping push the envelope forward when it comes to fashion journalism.

       "  'comments_content': 'The battle between Google and Apple continues.  RJ Pittman, a prominent product manager Director of Product Management at Google, has left the company to join Apple.  We&#8217;ve been tipped off to a tweet he sent out two days ago that said &#8220;My last day at Google. Incredible experience. Amazing people. Moved mountains. Next chapter. Hello Apple.&#8221; Pittman has since removed the tweet from his Twitter feed, but judging by the tweets still visible in Twitter search, it&#8217;s true. Update: This post originally said Pittman was a Product Manager, but his title was in fact Director of Product Management.We&#8217;ve also received an email that Pittman Â\\xa0sent to his coworkers and friends about the move (we&#8217;ve redacted a paragraph about hanging out with his family during his time off):Yesterday was my last day directing traffic at Google. It has been an incredible ride, and an amazing experience.  Google is one of the most fascinating companies to work for.  Working at Google scale is pretty incredible and the people are one of a kind, to say the least.  It&#8217;s been an amazing 3 years of my career.  It was very hard to say goodbye to all the people I call family at the Googleplex around the world.  The company afforded me the opportunity to be &#8216;me&#8217; inside the walls of a 20,000 person company that generates $20B in revenue.  For that, I will always be grateful.  I learned so much about the world, our users, and most of all&#8230;me.   I left with a very heavy heart yesterday.  Leaving was much harder that I expected.  Admittedly, I&#8217;m feeling a bit useless today, my first day as a Xoogler. But I&#8217;m hoping this feeling will wear off soon.  (Noogler is  our term for a newly hired Googler, and Xooglers are the band of ex-Google alumni)I was sprung from Google by a little company down the road that you might have heard of called Apple.  Some might say I owe most of my career in technology to a little start up company that created the computer that I first learned to program, the Apple II, in 1980.  By 1984, my life would be changed forever with the introduction of the most revolutionary creation of the decade, the Macintosh.  A year later I would find myself spending more time with my first Mac than any other living being for my foreseeable teenage future.  I&#8217;ve owned almost one of every Apple product released since then, and still own my first Mac that started it all some 25 years ago.  In a strange but not so strange way, this is a sort of homecoming for me, despite never having worked for Apple.  Life works in curious ways, and I love it when every so often it comes full circle.  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited for what lies  ahead.  They&#8217;ve created a pretty neat role for me, which I will be able to talk about soon after I&#8217;ve started working there.&#8230;It&#8217;s unclear exactly what project Pittman is working on (his email only says that it&#8217;s a &#8220;pretty neat role for me&#8221;) and there&#8217;s little chance Apple&#8217;s PR team is going to give us any guidance.  That said, my hunch is that he was recruited at the behest of the Lala team.Apple acquired the streaming music service in December, less than two months after Google and Lala worked in tandem to launch Google OneBox Music Search. Pittman was one of the key players on that project, and worked closely with Lala to get it off the ground.That said, Apple could be after his other talents â\\x80\\x94 Pittman had previously presented at the launches of other search-related products, including a Google Labs event. And before that, he founded Groxis.We&#8217;d previously heard that Google and Apple had a gentlemen&#8217;s agreement not to poach each other&#8217;s employees. Obviously, that&#8217;s no longer the case.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The new feature is open to all DocStoc users and offers the ability to customize the logo, buttons, links, and color of the viewer.The viewer itself is fairly sleek and resembles DocStoc&#8217;s normal document viewers. Users can directly download documents from the viewer and DocStoc will automatically convert any convert historical embeds with Docstoc. For example, all of the documents we&#8217;ve embedded with our TechCrunch DocStoc account will now include our branded viewer.Also included in the viewer is the ability to monetize on the publisher side. So publishers can choose to put streams of ads in the viewers, which is operated by DocStoc. DocStoc and the publisher will then share in any advertising revenue. Competitor Scribd launched branded viewers in October, but the feature appears to be only available to select publishers.  The startup just launched a new marketplace for professional documents and with 3 million registered users, DocStoc is now profitable.

The positioning technology is in use in tens of millions of devices around the globe, including, notably, on every iPhone. And now the company has a simple way for third-parties to tap into that data in a useful way.SpotRank gives developers access to hundreds of million of anonymous location entry points put into the Skyhook system. In fact, there are some 500 million points (100 meter &#8220;spots&#8221;) at the service&#8217;s launch. With this massive amount of data, developers can do things such as predict what locations will be hot on which nights, or predict traffic patterns. They have so much data because it&#8217;s not based around things like check-ins, which are hot right now on the consumer side of location, but rather everytime a device needs location for anything.The first partner signing up to use SpotRank is SimpleGeo. It seems like a perfect partnership. SimpleGeo provides back-end location services for many startups, so the more data, the better. And Skyhook&#8217;s data goes back several years, a nice addition for the young SimpleGeo.One thing SimpleGeo co-founder Matt Galligan is particularly excited about is that the SpotRank data is all time-coded. This will allow users of its service to do trending data. And SimpleGeo is working on making the data realtime.Other partners interested in signing up for SpotRank include the hot location startup Gowalla, and ShopKick, the soon-to-launch retail location check-in service (makers of the CauseWorld app that we&#8217;ve covered a few times).At some point tomorrow, the SpotRank data should be live on Skyhook&#8217;s site showing some SXSW data â\\x80\\x94 which will no doubt be huge with the Location War going on.[photo: flickr/flattop341]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In our Scamville series of posts last October we exposed the massive user fraud occurring Facebook and MySpace social games. Fake quizzes tied to long term mobile subscriptions, malware-laden toolbar downloads and other scams were the center of the controversy.  The industry did a lot of talking in the wake of those posts and some long term changes have been made. For the most part, for example, Fake quizzes and the Video Professor scam are off Facebook (but see below on what&#8217;s still there). But now we&#8217;re seeing the same old scams hit the iPhone. And the same players, particularly OfferPal Media and SuperRewards and now Google, are powering those scams. Specifically we&#8217;re seeing SMS-subscription offers, which trick users into putting long term subscriptions on their mobile phones (or their parent&#8217;s mobile phones).New Offerpal CEO George Garrick promised to take a leadership position in cleaning up scammy ads. He said &#8220;It will be a fundamental part of the Offerpal culture that any offers we distribute meet stringent standards of integrity and quality, as specified by our partners, credible industry experts, and good old common sense.&#8221;We&#8217;ve seen very misleading SMS subscription ads on a variety of applications with Admob ads. We&#8217;ve reached out to Google for their comment. Tap Defense, an iphone game created by TapJoy, contained multiple version of the SMS subscription scam until today. The offers were being run by Offerpal. After we contacted Offerpal about this story the offers were removed and they gave us the following statement:Offerpal and I have done everything we said we would do following the initial social-game offer controversy back in November.  We quickly adopted strict compliance rules modeled on Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s requirements, and we have been working closely with the major social platforms and game developers to ensure that only the highest quality offers have been run and we have succeeded.  Our offers and other â\\x80\\x9calt payâ\\x80\\x9d options have been running continuously and there have been no compliance issues since, and these â\\x80\\x9calt-payâ\\x80\\x9d offers are many times more popular than cash purchases with social game users.  Consumers love them and they provide additional monetization for developersWe also led the formation of an IAB standards board to set industry guidelines for lead-gen offers on social networks, and Offerpal is the ONLY offer-network who is participating in this effort.  So the issue of offer quality on social networks has been properly addressed and is considered by the industry to be an issue of the past.  Recently, we have begun to test offers in a few mobile games and apps, in particular on the iPhone.   Offerpal has been participating in this effort at the request of a couple of iPhone developers and we have also just opened a direct dialogue with Apple to jointly establish standards and guidelines for offers in iPhone apps before any general rollout.   In the meantime, we have been applying the same quidelines that we have been successfully using in Social Games to the few mobile apps that are carrying offers.  However the vast majority of the â\\x80\\x9coffersâ\\x80\\x9d that are running in iPhone apps are simply installs of other iPhone apps, as can be seen for example in â\\x80\\x9cTap Tap Revenge 3â\\x80\\x9d.    However, Mike has raised the question of whether mobile quizzes and other apps resulting in PSMS subscriptions may still not be clear enough in citing their terms since users may not realize they are opting in for an ongoing PSMS subscription.  Although such quizzes and PSMS offers are currently in wide distribution by most of the major mobile ad networks, Mike raises a valid question.  So in the interest of being conservative and wanting to operate in the best interests of the collective mobile user experience, we have immediately removed the quizzes in question and any offers resulting in PSMS subscriptions from distribution pending a further review of the concerns Mike has raised.  Over the next week or so we will accumulate as much feedback as we can from developers, publishers, mobile platforms, and others in the industry, and on Monday March 22 we will publish on our website and via a press release a written statement of our guidelines and policies regarding alt-pay offers in mobile apps.  George GarrickChairman and CEO, Offerpal.These types of offers are particularly insidious. Users are offered virtual currency in exchange for answering a quiz or some other seemingly harmless offer. But once they click through and awswer the quiz questions they&#8217;re told they need to enter their mobile phone number to get quiz results. Often there is fine print outlining the charges. But the already tiny print is completely unreadable on a mobile screen, making that disclosure meaningless even when it appears.SMS subscription scams are among the most lucrative offers to game publishers because users get a recurring fee of $10 &#8211; $25 per month until they are able to terminate the subscription. Many users never notice them, and those that do usually have a lot of trouble getting them shut off.Zwinky Back On Facebook:We&#8217;ve also seen offers for the Zwinky toolbar back on Facebook games. When Zynga CEO Mark Pincus said &#8220;I did every horrible thing in the book to, just to get revenues right away&#8221; he was talking about Zwinky, one of the most hated malware wrappers on the Internet. Too see it back on Facebook offers, through both Offerpal and SuperRewards (we saw offers from both companies on Fishworld by TallTreeGames) is disconcerting.More screenshots',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The SXSW festival in Austin, Texas is currently ground zero for a war, the location war. While over a dozen services have launched new products or features around location, two still seem to stand above all others in terms of use here: Foursquare and Gowalla. Earlier today, Business Insider ran a report suggesting that Foursquare was dominating the battle â\\x80\\x94 unfortunately, that&#8217;s simply not true.In fact, Foursquare and Gowalla are basically in a statistical dead heat, at least in Austin. Multiple sources confirmed this information, and one actually showed me proof (which I was asked not to share). In other words, the war is still raging.So why did Business Insider draw the conclusion that Foursquare was &#8220;mopping the floor&#8221; with Gowalla? Because they looked at their &#8220;The Hive&#8221; feature which scans Twitter for links being shared by influencers, and noticed that many more are sharing Foursquare links. Of course, the main problem with this information is that it uses a small sample set of data. The other problem, as Business Insider notes in an update, is that Foursquare tends to have more &#8220;spam check-ins&#8221; â\\x80\\x94 that is, fake check-ins.It&#8217;s important to remember that while Gowalla uses GPS data to verify a person is actually at the venue they say they are, Foursquare does not. That&#8217;s how this guy can check-in all over the world and steal mayorships for places he&#8217;s never been. The downside to Gowalla&#8217;s system is that sometimes it prevents you from being able to check-in at all, if they can&#8217;t verify you&#8217;re at a place. Or sometimes places are created in the wrong spot, so you can&#8217;t check-in some places even if you&#8217;re really there.To use my own small sample set of data, it seems that the people on my social graph is Austin are in fact using both Foursquare and Gowalla to check-in everywhere they go. I&#8217;ve also noticed that more seem to be sending check-in data to Twitter from Foursquare. But again, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not using both, just that they&#8217;ve decided to use only one to send out data to Twitter (which makes sense), and for whatever reason, most are choosing Foursquare for that.[image: DreamWorks Pictures]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This afternoon at SXSW, a panel of Gmail and Google Buzz team members took part in a panel where they discussed what goes on behind the scenes at Gmail.  The panel covered a smattering of topics, covering everything from Gmail stickers to site speed, but eventually the discussion turned to the elephant in the room: Google Buzz&#8217;s privacy shortcomings when it launched last month.Google Product Manager Todd Jackson said that Google had learned a lot from the incident, acknowledging that Google was in error when it made the assumption that users wanted to move their email and chat contacts over to their Buzz social graph, and auto-followed them. Â\\xa0To make sure that kind of blunder doesn&#8217;t happen again, he revealed that Google may start pre-releasing new Buzz features to small subsets of users.So why exactly did Google Buzz launch with some key social features missing? Jackson said that while Google employees were testing out the product internally, they never had much desire to mute any of their coworkers, and that their email contact list closely matched the people they wanted to follow on Buzz. Obviously, that wasn&#8217;t true for most people once the product was released outside of the Googleplex.  Which is why Google is considering pre-releasing new Buzz features to a few thousand opt-in users long before they&#8217;re rolled out to the public.That would stand in contrast to what Google does for many of its major product launches, as Jackson says that the company doesn&#8217;t like to preannounce things (it frustrates users when they can&#8217;t try the new release out for themselves).  But in the case of Buzz, where changes can have a major impact with respect to user privacy, it sounds like Google may be making an exception.  Jackson also noted that he had actually asked SXSW speaker danah boyd to give her keynote talk on privacy and publicity at Google headquarters.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It&#8217;s not enough to be a &#8220;shit funnel&#8221; where they would pass some of the junk down to engineers, they need to fully protect the engineers.This sentiment was echoed by Edward Ho, who is known as &#8220;Mr. Buzz,&#8221; as he&#8217;s the one whoÂ\\xa0built up the Google Buzz team (a sub-unit of the Gmail team).

Weardrobe, Polyvore and others are taking fashion and style to a new level with the ability to socialize looks and designers. A new fashion-focused site, Go Try It On aims to to add a social element to both figuring out what to wear and getting feedback on a particular outfit. A finalist at the Microsoft BizSpark Accelerator at SXSW, Go Try It On allows users to share photos of themselves and get honest opinions on their look before they go out. Once you upload a photo of yourself, you can add descriptions of the brands you are wearing and include context around the choice of the oufit (i.e. first date, black-tie gala). The site&#8217;s community can then comment on the site and provide feedback on fellow members&#8217; outfits. Users have three options in terms of getting feedback: They can ask the community, keep their looks private, and just share with their friends, and finally, ask a brand if they are really looking for some savvy specific fashion advice. Eventually, Go Try It On will make money from affiliate fees; allowing users to tag their clothes with links to buy items at particular retailers. The site is similar in theory to Weardrobe, a site that allows users to share their &#8220;street-style&#8221; photos of outfits. Go Try It On differs slightly with its emphasis on the feedback from its community. The main barrier Go Try It On will face is gaining a trusted community; but with the participation of popular brands, the site could be able to gain a loyal following. One way the site could socialize users&#8217; outfits further would be via Facebook Connect. But, Weardrobe saw success with its model and was able to gain a loyal following. The startup was selected as a fbFund winner and was recently acquired by Like.com. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Facebook&#8217;s f8 conference is shaping up to have quite a few improvements in store for developers, and we think we&#8217;ve come across another one: a change to Facebook&#8217;s data retention policy.  Yesterday, Facebook employee  Monica Keller (who left MySpace to join the company last month), took part in a conversation on Twitter that seemed to indicate that developers may no longer have to delete user data. The possible change came to light after Gnip CEO Eric Marcoullier gently chided Keller about developers being unable to store any user data, to which she responded, &#8220;come to f8!&#8221;.Since that tweet, we&#8217;ve heard further whispers about a change to Facebook&#8217;s 24 hour policy retention, and that Facebook is already briefing developers on the upcoming changes.So why does this matter? Facebook has historically been quite restrictive with regard to what developers are allowed to do with user data; in particular, it only allows developers using Facebook Connect to store user data for 24 hours before they have to delete it, or ping Facebook&#8217;s servers for a refresh.  There are some exceptions to that rule (you can get a sense for them here), but the majority of the &#8216;meaty&#8217; content can&#8217;t be stored by developers.  As a result, applications have to constantly connect with Facebook&#8217;s servers, which multiple developers we&#8217;ve spoken with say is very Â\\xa0inefficient.If Facebook does extend that 24 hour window, developers would be able to do things that generally require locally stored data, like batch processing (this isn&#8217;t feasible now because the application would have to make an API call for each user).  Likewise, if these applications had the data stored locally they would be able to boost load speeds because they wouldn&#8217;t have to Â\\xa0wait for a call to Facebook&#8217;s servers after their applications loaded.Of course, such a change would also have privacy implications (we&#8217;ll wait until we have all the details before we analyze those). Â\\xa0That said, we&#8217;ve also heard that many developers simply ignore some of Facebook&#8217;s data retention policies, in part because Facebook has a very hard time enforcing them.  So it&#8217;s unclear just how big an impact this would have on the applications being developed.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I mentioned in my last post that mobile is bridging the digitalâ\\x80\\x94not to mention analogâ\\x80\\x94 divide in India, with almost half as many new mobile accounts being opened just last January as there are Internet users in the entire country.Â\\xa0 And there are a host of interesting companies seeking to leverage that network as some kind of rudimentary, literally â\\x80\\x9cdial-up,â\\x80\\x9d Internet that extends far beyond the countryâ\\x80\\x99s 50 million or so Web users.One of the most ambitious companies I met with during my last trip to India in November was Eko, a mobile banking company. There are a few SMS-based bank applications in India, but Eko differs because the phone isnâ\\x80\\x99t just another channel for the accountâ\\x80\\x94it is the account. You make payments and transfer money simply by dialing numbers. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so simple, you donâ\\x80\\x99t even need to understand SMS to use it.Itâ\\x80\\x99s an ingenious offering that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t try to be everything to everyone. It aims squarely at the unbankedâ\\x80\\x94some 60% of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s huge population. For now, Eko is focusing on the 1,000 kilometer corridor between Delhi and Bihar.Itâ\\x80\\x99s a textbook case of the how hard it is to build something incredibly simple within a sandbox of tight constraintsâ\\x80\\x94yet that simplicity is the same thing many would argue caused Twitterâ\\x80\\x99s 140-character missives to become so universal. There are no extra bells and whistles with Ekoâ\\x80\\x99s service because thereâ\\x80\\x99s no room for them, and at the end of the day, probably little need for them.The accounts are actually held by the State Bank of India, which insures up to 100,000 rupees per account, but Ekoâ\\x80\\x99s customers donâ\\x80\\x99t ever go into banks. The â\\x80\\x9ctellersâ\\x80\\x9d are the tiny corner groceries that dot every neighborhood and street corner in Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s crammed urban areas and expansive rural areas. They are the center of commerce for those living on intermittent jobs, tips and handouts. These stores sell medications by the pill, shampoo in tiny sachets, cell phone minutes by the Paisa, and frequently extend credit when needed. Eko just seeks to give this already trusted, daily-visited vendor one more thing to sell.The interface is simple enough for anyone to use, regardless of language or literacy. Just like filling out a check requires you to enter the payee, how much you are paying and sign it and Eko transaction has the same three elements. Eko customers type the bankâ\\x80\\x99s short code, then an asterisk, then the mobile number of the person you are paying, then an asterisk, then the amount, then another asterisk. Then comes the signature. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the tricky part, but also the most important, because the account is solely on phones, which can be stolen.Ekoâ\\x80\\x99s founder Abhishek Sinha (pictured above amid his signage) wanted to come up with a cost-affective equivalent of an RSA token, so he created a paper version of it. Account holders get little booklets with pages of 11-digit codes. Seven digits of it are random numbers, with four randomly placed black marks, where the person enters his or her PIN. So even if the booklet is stolen, no one knows the PIN number and they still can&#8217;t access the account. There&#8217;s a VeriSign logo on the back of each booklet. Sinha reached out to VeriSign to see if they could come up with a better solution&#8211; instead they endorsed his.Freedom from always having to carry cash has obvious safety and empowerment implications. But this is a hard company to build out broadly in a country like India. The very strength of the model to truly reach the unbankedâ\\x80\\x94turning those trusted, neighborhood grocers into tellersâ\\x80\\x94inherently makes it costly and time-consuming to build because there are so many of them serving relatively small neighborhoods and villages. Eko has 30,000 account-holders right now. â\\x80\\x9cI thought itâ\\x80\\x99d be a million by now,â\\x80\\x9d Sinha says. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve had a lot of false starts.â\\x80\\x9dThereâ\\x80\\x99s a cost-time trade off. Since the service launched in late 2007, Eko was outsourcing the management of the grocers to a third party who sells multiple things through the channel already. But evangelizing the product takes more hand-holding, so the number of accounts wasnâ\\x80\\x99t growing. Since November, Eko has taken over the management of these grocer accounts assigning employees to each neighborhood and investing in street promotions, blaring its Bollywood-eque jingle extolling the virtues of banking and bedecking stores with in-store signage. Now new accounts are soaring. Eko had just 6,000 accounts before the switch in strategy. It added 10,000 in January and is now adding 10,000 every 15 days.But costs are going up too. Sinha, who made some money founding a previous company Six DEE Telecom Solutions, has self-funded the venture until now, and in Eko got a $1.78 million grant from the World Bank and The Gates Foundation. But that money will run out this year. Heâ\\x80\\x99s working on raising a venture round nowâ\\x80\\x94and hoping to get a whopping $10 million. In his previous startup he says he was turned down by literally hundreds of VCs and says that this time itâ\\x80\\x99s going a lot better. Indeed, he jokes, itâ\\x80\\x99d be hard for it to go worse. For one thing, heâ\\x80\\x99s learned a 60 page PowerPoint is overkill.Like VNL, the solar-powered, mobile equipment company that was 100% bootstrapped by the founder, this is one of those companies that is tricky to build in India. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a huge social need and business opportunity if it hits scale, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a lack of capital to support deals like this. A venture firm is more comfortable in the $3 million-to-$5 million range and a private equity firm would demand a lot more maturity of the business before it would invest. Had Sinha not invested his savings in the project, it likely wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have gotten this far.I asked several times if Sinha was worried. What if he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t raise the money? He laughed every time I asked with a look in his eyes of â\\x80\\x9cDo you know how hard it actually is to be an Indian tech entrepreneur?â\\x80\\x9d He says heâ\\x80\\x99s been through enough to know thereâ\\x80\\x99s always a way. (Regular readers know thereâ\\x80\\x99s a word for that.)',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: When venture capitalists invest in early stage startups, more than anything else they are investing in the founders of the company and their ability to lead their employees through the most improbable set of circumstances to take an idea from a germ to a real and profitable business.  In this guest post, Ben Horowitz of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz explains the leadership traits he and his co-founder Marc Andreessen look for before they invest in a startup.  SOme of their investments include Skype, Zynga, Factual, and RockMelt.  Before becoming investing partners, Horowitz and Andreessen co-founded Opsware, which they sold to HP for $1.6 billion, and prior to that Horowitz was an executive at Netscape.At Andreessen Horowitz, we favor founders running the company. The reasons are many (and will be the topic of a future blog post). As a result, we spend a great deal of time thinking about the characteristics required to be a founding CEO. Perhaps the most important attribute required to be a successful founding CEO is leadership. So what is leadership and how do we think about it in the context of the CEO job? Are great leaders born or made?Most people define leadership in the same way that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously defined pornography when he said: â\\x80\\x9cI know it when I see it.â\\x80\\x9dA better definition comes from former Secretary of State Colin Powell who said: â\\x80\\x9cYou have achieved excellence as a leader when people will follow you anywhere if only out of curiosity.â\\x80\\x9d  For our purposes, we can generalize this to be the measure of the quality of a leader: the quantity, quality and diversity of people who want to follow her.So what makes people want to follow a leader?  We look for 3 key traits:The ability to articulate the visionThe right kind of ambitionThe ability to achieve the visionLetâ\\x80\\x99s take these in order.The ability to articulate the visionâ\\x80\\x94The Steve Jobs AttributeCan the leader articulate a vision thatâ\\x80\\x99s interesting, dynamic, and compelling? More importantly, can the leader do this when things fall apart? More specifically, when the company gets to a point when it does not make objective financial sense for any employee to continue working there, will the leader be able to articulate a vision thatâ\\x80\\x99s compelling enough that the people stay out of curiosity?I believe that Jobsâ\\x80\\x99 greatest achievement as a visionary leader so far was a) getting so many super talented people to continue following him at NeXT, long after the company lost its patina; then b) getting the employees of Apple to buy into his vision when the company was weeks away from bankruptcy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult to imagine any other leader being so compelling that they could do these back-to-back and this is why we call this one the Steve Jobs attribute.The right kind of ambitionâ\\x80\\x94The Bill Campbell AttributeAndy Grove once remarked that a company needs highly ambitious executives in order to achieve its goals. However, itâ\\x80\\x99s critical that those executives have â\\x80\\x9cthe right kind of ambitionâ\\x80\\x9d: ambition for the success of the company rather than the â\\x80\\x9cwrong kind of ambitionâ\\x80\\x9d: ambition for the success of themselves.One of the biggest misperceptions in our society is that a prerequisite for becoming a CEO is being selfish, ruthless, and callous. In fact, the opposite is true and the reason is obvious. The first thing that any successful CEO must do is get really great people to work for her. Smart people do not want to work for people who do not have their interests in mind and in heart.Most of us have experienced this in our careers: a bright, ambitious, hard working executive that nobody good wants to work for and who, as a result, delivers performance far worse than one might imagine.Truly great leaders create an environment where the employees feel that the CEO cares much more about the employees than she cares about herself. In this kind of environment, an amazing thing happens: a huge number of the employees believe that itâ\\x80\\x99s their company and behave accordingly. As the company grows large, these employees become the quality control for the entire organization. They set the standard of work that all future employees must live up to. As in, â\\x80\\x9cHey, you need to do a better job on that datasheetâ\\x80\\x94you are screwing up my company.â\\x80\\x9dI call this characteristic the Bill Campbell Attribute after my friend Bill who is the best that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen at this. If you talk to people who worked in any of the many organizations that Bill has run, they refer to those organizations as â\\x80\\x9cmy organizationâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cmy company.â\\x80\\x9d A huge part of why he has been so unbelievably strong on this dimension of leadership is that heâ\\x80\\x99s totally authentic. He would happily sacrifice his own economics, fame, glory, and rewards for his employees. When you talk to Bill, you get the feeling that he cares deeply about you and what you have to say, because he does. And all of that shows up in his actions and follow through.Ability to achieve the visionâ\\x80\\x94The Andy Grove AttributeThe final leg of our leadership stool is competence, pure and simple. If I buy into the vision and believe that the leader cares about me, do I think she can actually achieve the vision? Will I follow her into the jungle with no map forward or back and trust that she will get me out of there?I like to refer to this as the Andy Grove attribute. Andy Grove will always be my model of CEO competence. He earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, wrote the best management book that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever read (High Output Management), and tirelessly refined his craft. Not only did he write exceptional books on management, he taught management classes at Intel throughout his tenure.In his classic book, Only the Paranoid Survive, Grove details the story of leading Intel through the dramatic transition from the memory business to the microprocessor business. In doing so, he walked away from nearly all of his revenue. He humbly credits others in the company with coming to the strategic conclusion before he did, but the credit for swiftly and successfully leading the company through the transition goes to Dr. Grove. Changing your primary business as a 16 year old, large, public company raises a lot of questions. As Andy describes in an incident with one of his employees:One of them attacked me aggressively, asking, &#8220;Does it mean that you can conceive of Intel without being in the memory business?&#8221; I swallowed hard and said, â\\x80\\x98yes, I guess I can.â\\x80\\x99 All hell broke loose.Despite shocking many of his best employees with this radical strategy, ultimately the company trusted Andy. They trusted him to rebuild their company around an entirely new business. And that trust turned out to be very well placed.So, are great leaders born or made? Letâ\\x80\\x99s look at this one attribute at a time:Articulation of the visionâ\\x80\\x94There is no question that some people are much better story tellers than others. However, it is also true that anybody can greatly improve in this area through focus and hard work. All CEOs should work on the vision component of leadership.Alignment of interestsâ\\x80\\x94I am not sure if the Bill Campbell Attribute is impossible to learn, but I am pretty sure that it is impossible to teach. Of the three, this one most fits the bill â\\x80\\x9cborn not made.â\\x80\\x9dAbility to achieve the visionâ\\x80\\x94This attribute can absolutely be made; perhaps this is why Andy Groveâ\\x80\\x99s tolerance for incompetence was legendarily low. Indeed, the enemy of competence is sometimes confidence. A CEO should never be so confident that she stops improving her skills.In the end, some attributes of leadership can be improved more than others, but every CEO should work on all three.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Former Intel chairman and CEO Craig Barrett is a strong proponent of priming the pump with more undergraduate science, engineering, and math students.  Duke/UC-Berkeley professor (and regular TechCrunch columnist) Vivek Wadhwa thinks that better rewards for people who pursue engineering and science degrees is the right approach.  So we asked Barrett and Wadhwa to debate the issue of how best to fix technology education in the U.S.  Their exchange is below:Vivek Wadhwa:Craig Barrett is someone who I hold in the highest regard. Ever since he retired as Intelâ\\x80\\x99s CEO, Dr. Barrett has made it his lifeâ\\x80\\x99s mission to improve U.S. competitiveness. He believes that the way to do this is to teach more math and science. And he believes we need to graduate more PhDs in science and engineering.I wholeheartedly support improvements in education and know the value that math and science skills provide. But the problems I see in U.S. competitiveness arenâ\\x80\\x99t related to the numbers of engineering PhDs or scientists that we graduate. American companies are shifting R&amp;D abroad because it makes economic sense for them to be near growth markets, and they can hire talented workers at a lower cost. It isnâ\\x80\\x99t about deficiencies in American workers or a weakness of U.S. math and science education.We are also graduating enough PhDs in science and engineering. The problem is that the majority of these graduates are foreign nationals (who are now increasingly returning home). Americanâ\\x80\\x99s donâ\\x80\\x99t consider it worthwhile to complete advanced science and engineering degrees because it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make financial sense for them to do so. Research by Harvard economist Richard Freeman showed that because salaries for scientists and engineers are lower than for other professions, the investment that students have to make in higher degrees isn&#8217;t cost-justified. Doctoral graduate students typically spend seven to eight years earning a PhD, during which time they are paid stipends. These stipends are usually less than what a bachelor&#8217;s degree-holder makes. Some students never make up for this financial loss. Foreign students typically have fewer opportunities and see a U.S. education as their ticket to the U.S. job market and citizenship. Hence, 60% of U.S. engineering PhD graduates are foreigners.As this article from Scientific American discusses, the problems are even worse for graduating scientists.â\\x80¦But today, however, few young PhDs can get started on the career for which their graduate education purportedly trained them, namely, as faculty members in academic research institutions. Instead, scores of thousands of them spend the years after they earn their doctorates toiling in low-paying, dead-end postdoctoral â\\x80\\x9ctrainingâ\\x80\\x9d appointments (called postdocs) in the laboratories of professors, where they ostensibly hone skills they would need to start labs of their own when they become professors. In fact, however, only about 25 percent of those earning American science PhDs will ever land a faculty job that enables them to apply for the competitive grants that support academic research. And even fewerâ\\x80\\x9415 percent by some estimatesâ\\x80\\x94will get a post at the kind of research university where the nationâ\\x80\\x99s significant scientific work takes place.So, my argument is that if we create the incentives for American children to study math and science and to complete advanced degrees, the magic will happen. In addition to math and science, we should teach our children about world culture, geography, and global markets. In the era of globalization, these subjects are equally important.  And while we fix the incentives for Americans, letâ\\x80\\x99s do all we can to keep the best foreign students who come to the U.S. to study, here, so they are competing on our side.Craig Barrett:Economic competitiveness in the 21st Century will be quite different than in the past.  With the free flow of information, capital, and people, economies will have to look for new comparative advantages.  Most observers of this topic conclude that there are only three things that a country can do to increase their relative competitiveness and provide for an increased standard of living for their citizens.  Countries have to invest in the education of their work force (smart people), they have to invest in research and development (smart ideas) and they have to provide the right environment to let smart people get together with smart ideas and create new products, new businesses, and new services.  The most fundamental of these three issues is education.  Historically the standard of living or per capita income has tracked closely with the level of education of the work forceâ\\x80\\x94as education lets workers add value to what they do and as the economy grows the standards of living increase.Looking forward every major economy has identified the general areas that will drive innovation and economic growth.  Japan, the US, and the EU have all listed those technologies (nanotech, photonics, new materials, micro electronics, alternative energy, biotech, etc) that will be key for development, productivity improvements, and growth.  All of these areas have the common foundation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  Hence it is straightforward to conclude that work force expertise in STEM will be a determinant of economic growth.If we look at the US for a moment we can make several observations about the education of our current and future work force.US kids on average do poorly in mathematics, science and problem solving when compared to their OECD peers;Fewer US kids choose to major in the hard sciences and engineering each year (most of our engineering graduate students are in fact foreign nationals).The current 25 year old generation will be less well educated (defined by college graduation rates) than the 45 year old generationMost OECD and emerging economy countries are increasing their college (and STEM) graduation ratesSo in contrast to the importance of STEM education for economic performance in the 21st Century we see the US moving in the opposite direction.  Certainly our universities are still top ranked in the world in STEM but increasingly the graduates of those universities are foreign nationals who are often choosing to return home to pursue their professional careers.  And we are producing no more STEM graduates than we did decades ago.If the US is really serious about competing in the 21st Century economy we will have to decide to compete.  This simply means that you have to create the work force (smart people), invest in R&amp;D (smart ideas) and make sure the environment is attractive to investment in innovation (do something about tax rates, make it easier to form corporations, provide incentives to invest in R&amp;D and make capital investments, etc).  Otherwise you will see the continuous flight of capital and jobs to regions of the world where governments have made the environment more attractive.  This is not a simple issue of wage ratesâ\\x80\\x94corporations chase after the best possible work force in areas where the total cost is most attractive and often the total cost is much more heavily weighted by corporate tax rates and incentives, not wage rates.STEM education is key for our future.  We need a major upgrade in our K-12 education to produce high school graduates who understand and appreciate STEM.We need more undergraduates majoring in STEM for the jobs of the 21st Century.  And we need more STEM graduate students to drive those industries that are key to our future.  As a measure of how rapidly things are changing with time, it used to be that many STEM Ph.Ds turned right around and went after faculty positions in our universities.  Today, STEM Ph.Ds are the entry level education requirements to get into the engineering and research laboratories of the successful tech corporations in the US, like Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, IBM, etc.   It is also certain that not every STEM graduate is going to pursue a limited career in STEM.  STEM education is a great introduction to many other professions â\\x80\\x93 the basis of STEM education being problem solving means that this education is a great entry to other jobs.  In fact the most common educational background of the Fortune 500 CEOs is engineering.So at a time when the rest of the world is gearing up for competition letâ\\x80\\x99s refocus the US to do the same.  That is unless you believe our future is in low value add services or manufacturing, investment banking, tort lawyers or asphalt ready construction jobs.  Somebody has to create some wealth if you want your economy to grow.Vivek Wadhwa&#8217;s Rebuttal:Again, I wholeheartedly agree that we need to improve K-12 education and I agree about the importance of STEM education. The question is, how do you motivate American children to enter fields like science and engineering that are harder than others to learn, donâ\\x80\\x99t provide the economic rewards, and that arenâ\\x80\\x99t considered â\\x80\\x9ccoolâ\\x80\\x9d? We canâ\\x80\\x99t force our children to do PhDs in math.As the article from Scientific American showed, many engineering and science PhDs canâ\\x80\\x99t even get jobs â\\x80\\x93 in academia or industry. This is after they have worked for years at ridiculously low wages as researchers or postdocs. Those that do get jobs donâ\\x80\\x99t ever make up for the financial sacrifice they have made. When American children choose to study science or engineering, their friends call them geeks or nerds â\\x80\\x93 they are made to feel inferior. Their Indian and Chinese counterparts are held in high regard by society and end up at the top of the social ladder. Indian and Chinese engineers and scientists are often national heroes. Here, our kids idolize football players and rock stars.We canâ\\x80\\x99t also just tell our children that the nationâ\\x80\\x99s competitiveness and standard of living depends on them making sacrifice and completing advanced degrees in math and science. They wonâ\\x80\\x99t care. We should improve the K-12 education system as you suggest. Our corporations should also invest in workforce development â\\x80\\x93 which they generally donâ\\x80\\x99t. We should also provide tax breaks for research as you say. And we should fix our university research system (I have written about the big problems with this).The issue I am highlighting is that even if we did all of the good things you suggest, this would not fix the problem of American children not being motivated to become scientists and engineers. My top students at the Masters of Engineering Management Program at Duke University still vie for high-paying investment banking jobs; they donâ\\x80\\x99t become engineers. It is the same with our top PhDs in math; they become quants at investment banks. Their talent ends up being used by investment banks to find new ways of bilking the financial system.We need to create the excitement about science and engineering at the national level and motivate our best and brightest to become engineers and scientists. And we need to make it worthwhile financially for them to help our country stay competitive and to solve the problems facing our planet. This is as much a marketing problem as it is an investment problem. An example of a way to fix the marketing problem is what National Academy of Engineering President, Charles Vest, proposed with the Grand Challenges for Engineering program. But this is a tiny first step. We need to do a lot more.Craig Barrett&#8217;s Rebuttal:Let me respectfully disagree with one point Vivek makes and then give some suggestions on how to overcome his second issue.First, this is not a financial compensation issue.  If it were then every kid who goes to college would choose to major in engineering because a BS in engineering (almost any subject) commands the highest salary of any university graduate.  Most kids donâ\\x80\\x99t major in engineering because they donâ\\x80\\x99t have the interest, the aptitude, or they like some other major more.  Our young college graduates do not chase the dollar; they tend to follow their interests.  In addition, when I look at the unemployment statistics, engineers are usually amongst the highest employment professions in the country.  Certainly the percentage of NFL or rock star wannabes or business administration majors or medieval history majors on unemployment is much higher than that for engineers.  So can we please move away from the simplistic argument that STEM doesnâ\\x80\\x99t pay?In addition if you look at graduate school and the graduate Ph.D who spends years working as a Post Doc angling for a teaching position at a prestigious university you simply cannot do an ROI analysis on his or her investment to land the faculty position and conclude that no one will be a Post Doc.  The individual is chasing that faculty position because that is what they really want to do.  Just like an aspiring actor spends years doing bit parts to finally land the big role.  You know that because the end point, the faculty position, is not the highest paid option for the Ph.D.  He or she can make more money in the private sector and probably have greater resources (capital facilities and research dollars) to pursue interesting problems.  The Post Doc pursues their interest precisely because that is what they are interested in.  As there are many more Post Docs than faculty positions available we have to conclude that Post Docs are Post Docs because they want to try to become faculty members and that Post Docs do not represent an inherent limitation or barrier to people trying to obtain a Ph.D in STEM.  The private sector has a strong appetite for STEM Ph.Dsâ\\x80\\x94just look at the hiring practices of the major corporations.The real barrier to pursuing degrees in STEM is that we have almost a perfect filter in place in K-12.  For a student to want to major in STEM in college they have to exit high school with a strong mathematics background.  That means that they need to have a good math teacher in nearly every grade (in addition to having a good physics, chemistry, and biology teacher).  We know that about 1/3 of all math and science teachers in K-12 are not certified in their subjects and probably do not do a good job educating and motivating their students.  If you assume for a moment that you need 12 good math teachers in a row to exit high school being proficient in math then the calculation of the probability of such an event happening is simple: 0.67 raised to the 12th power shows you what a perfect filter the K-12 system is.So how about a national effort to get more STEM content majors into K-12 teaching?  A few exciting programs have started in this space (UTeach out of Texas, Teach for America, the revamp of the education school at ASU).  All we need to do is start recognizing that hiring content experts in K-12 is more important than hiring someone who has studied education pedagogy for 4 years.  Just imagine how many folks interested in STEM want to take all those School of Education classes to get their teaching certificate.On to the point where I want to support Vivek, i.e., the need to get more kids interested in STEM during K-12.  This can happen in the class room with good teachers (can you imagine a PE teacher doubling as a math teacher inspiring kids to want to pursue math?) and it can happen outside of the class room.  For example I just spent yesterday afternoon in Phoenix at the FIRST Robotics Championship competitionâ\\x80\\x94the energy, the enthusiasm, the application of STEM was fantastic.  But only about 15,000 kids nationwide participate in this competition.  Just suppose we had a FIRST team at every school in the country.  Next week I am at the Intel Science Talent Search (the Nobel equivalent for high school students doing research).  The 40 finalists will be doing research better than my Ph.D thesis topic.  But only about 1500 kids a year enter this competitionâ\\x80\\x94what if we had 15,000?  Or 150,000?  This is where we need to mobilize the public and private sectors to improve.  This is where we can catch the imagination of the next generation and turn them into candidates for those STEM Ph.Ds.  There is sub critical mass working in this area â\\x80\\x93 it just needs to be expanded.  Suppose we organized the top 200 STEM oriented companies in the US and let them work at the local level to make FIRST robotics, science fairs, and computer club houses really happen across the US.  Then we could overcome the tired arguments that our society doesnâ\\x80\\x99t value STEM.  There is a movement to make this happen right now.  The best thing we could all do is throw our weight behind this effort.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The event is closely tied to TechCrunch, with myself as lead organizer and TC Europe editor Mike Butcher running things on stage. We invited a host of speakers from all corners of Europe to deliver inspiring keynotes about a wide range of topics, and as every year had 20 (well actually, 19) startups vying for the top prize in an exhilarating pitching competition.

       "  'comments_content': 'Last time I was in India I wrote about the amazing business model innovation that had allowed telecom operators to make money on a paltry $6 a month per average user. That compares to a desired average monthly payment of $50 or more in the U.S.The results have been phenomenalâ\\x80\\x94550 million people in India have phones, and it has transformed the poorer service economy by giving them an affordable way to be reached and arrange jobs. Just last month, nearly 20 million new mobile accounts were opened. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s more than double the people than have high speed Internet in the entire country. Even in slums where people live on less than $2 a day, everyone has a phone. If â\\x80\\x9cSlumdog Millionaireâ\\x80\\x9d was more accurate, Jamal wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have had to go on TV to find Latika. He could have just called her, or worst case, called a few friends until he found her number.Itâ\\x80\\x99s unequivocally Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s most successful infrastructure achievement â\\x80\\x94despite some mounting concerns about the effects of all those towers dotting nearly any urban rooftop that can hold one. And a host of exciting applications are being built on top of this invisible thread that connects a disparate country with a vast terrain and even bigger gulfs in language, literacy, income, religion, language and living standardsBut amazingly, when Rajiv Mehrotra (pictured below) looked at the existing telecom penetration in India, he saw failure. What about the people who canâ\\x80\\x99t afford $6 a month or live too far to get service? Donâ\\x80\\x99t they deserve to be connected as well? The result was VNL, a company thatâ\\x80\\x99s already gotten a good deal of press and acclaim for its dead-cheap, low-maintenance, Ikea-like easy-to-assemble, solar-powered base stations that extend existing mobile footprints into rural villages for a fraction of the price, allowing the remotest, poorest villages to have mobile phones in every household at drop-dead low prices. â\\x80\\x9cWe are the bottom of the bottom,â\\x80\\x9d boasts Mehrotra, practically daring competitors to try to play his low-cost, super-durability game.The World Economic Forum named it one of 26 Technology Pioneers, and just last month VNL won the Mobile World Congressâ\\x80\\x99s Green Mobile Award. Time called it a â\\x80\\x9cTech Pioneer that Will Change your Lifeâ\\x80\\x9d and Fast Company named it one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s 50 Most Innovative Companies in the world.I met with Mehrotra at the companyâ\\x80\\x99s headquarters in Gurgoan during my November trip to India. This time I wanted to see its technology live in villages and hear first hand what the impact had been. I traveled to a village that had now had phones for about seven months to see how the technology had changed their lives. Of the 500 families spread across this area, almost all of them had a phoneâ\\x80\\x94and most for the first time.The majority of the people I spoke with said the first calls they made were to family members, and that the biggest impact was the ability to stay in touch with family, to know when there was an emergency and be able to respond quickly.But there have been business effects too. One man (pictured here) has a business operating several trucks traveling between this village and Delhi and before heâ\\x80\\x99d have to ride on a bike between back-and-forth to coordinate them. Now he can sit at home and just call the drivers. He installed one of VNL&#8217;s small base stations on his roof, and he said it had increased his standing among his peersâ\\x80\\x94he is frequently the one called on to settle disputes. And now they can just call him. Similarly wives will call husbands out in the fields when its time to come in and eat, rather than trudging out to get them, allowing them to focus on kids and the housework.Another woman (pictured below) I spoke with was a widow with six kids and 21 grandchildren. (So many, she actually had to ask someone else how many she had.) As grandkids clambered in and out of her lap, she explained that she gets pension checks from the government, but the delivery used to be spotty. Before her phone she had no recourse but to travel to Delhi to inquire about it. Not exactly something she relishes, having lived her whole life in this village and only been to the big city twice. Now she can call the office and gives them an earful. Not surprisingly, the checks have started to come more regularly.Another man (pictured to the right) told me he felt more connected to the rest of India as a result of having a phone. This village is surrounded by mountains, and he said that he felt â\\x80\\x9cimprisonedâ\\x80\\x9d and cut off, despite being just a few hours drive from Delhi. Now he has a renewed interest in politics and whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening in other villages and the country at large. This man had only had his phone for six months, but he expected it would change his life in ways he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t articulate or imagine. â\\x80\\x9cSince the day I got this, my life has already changed,â\\x80\\x9d he said through an interpreter.Indeed, Mehrotra says itâ\\x80\\x99s already having a ripple effect on the politics of Rajasthanâ\\x80\\x94the state between Pakistan and India where VNL did its first installations. Politicians come through and make promises and villagers demand their cell phone numbers and call to check up on whether those promises are kept. â\\x80\\x9cThey have to be accountable,â\\x80\\x9d Mehrotra says. â\\x80\\x9cThey canâ\\x80\\x99t wriggle out.â\\x80\\x9dThese phones are not just a nice-to-have, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve quickly become a must have for these villages, deeply tied to the way they make money, participate in their government and retain closely important family relationships. And these ripple effects are only now beginning. Think of what the impact will be when there are better programs for marketing crops, saving money and even learning and game playing rolled out on these very basic phones. Life will always be different in a village or a city, but India can at least gain some basic common denominators between the two.Mehrotra is a big believer in the Gandhian mantra: Change the villages and you change India. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a serial entrepreneur who has already built businesses rolling out satellite TV and landlines to rural areas, but he thinks this company will have a bigger impact than anything else heâ\\x80\\x99s done and is the one with the real potential to go global. It bears noting that heâ\\x80\\x99s invested all of his own money in the projectâ\\x80\\x94and itâ\\x80\\x99s taken far more than he expected.This is not a cheap ventureâ\\x80\\x94Mehrotra has invested more than $100 million in the last five years and is still investing more. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure it could be built any other way. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think thereâ\\x80\\x99s the venture capital appetite or risk profile in India to fund something like this and most of the mobile equipment companies Mehrotra talked to back when he started thinking about this insisted it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be done. Once he built it heâ\\x80\\x99d take equipment and operator executives out to see it and they still couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it. They were making calls to test the quality from different areas of the village trying to find pockets without a signal. â\\x80\\x9cThey were climbing on the antenna and shaking it like monkeys trying to break it and they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d Mehrotra says.From a business point of view, the operators love VNL because it cheaply expands their existing footprint. The equipment operators arenâ\\x80\\x99t so sure. In theory, VNL isnâ\\x80\\x99t competing with them because theyâ\\x80\\x99re not going into the cities. Now that VNL has proved this model works, could a larger established vendor steal the market? The best chance of that would likely come from a Chinese powerhouse like Huawei.

And Mehrotra says there are some surprises in store. In terms of market, VNL is already rolling the technology out in other countries and in terms of product theyâ\\x80\\x99re not done with just simple mobile access. The countries are likely in Africa and perhaps Latin America, and my guess is the new functionality will entail turning on some kind of Internet access through the existing base stations.

       "  'comments_content': 'While a lot of the smaller startups like Foursquare and Gowalla are getting much of the buzz at SXSW, Twitter isn&#8217;t sitting idly on the location sidelines. Sure, they launched location integration on their site a few days ago, but they&#8217;ve also apparently set up a sub-site totally around location for SXSW. But here&#8217;s the weird thing: It&#8217;s only for stalking their employees.As co-founder Evan Williams tweeted out earlier, sxsw.twitter.com shows you a Google map of Austin, Texas (where SXSW is held) with tiny Twitter logos overlaid on it, showing Twitter employees at the conference tweeting.The site, which is clearly tailored for mobile usage (it looks great on the iPhone, for example), has two areas: &#8220;Twitter People&#8221; and &#8220;To Meet.&#8221; The Twitter People area is the one that shows the map and the tweets overlaid on it. The To Meet area is interesting because it asks, &#8220;Which of these sound like awesome things to work on?&#8221; and gives you a few different options to click on.For example, if you click on, &#8220;Making fast and sexy applications&#8221; it takes you to a list of various Twitter employees at SXSW that you should meet. If you click on &#8220;Partnering with Twitter,&#8221; you get a different list. Clearly, Twitter is using this site for both new employee recruitment, platform expansion, and partnership opportunities.Twitter, while now fairly commonplace in the mainstream (especially the media), first rose to fame among early tech adopters during SXSW three years ago.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Today at SXSWi, keynote speaker Danah Boyd took the stage to talk about privacy and publicity, and how they intertwine online.  Boyd is a Social Media Researcher at Microsoft Research New England, and has studied this space extensively for years. It was a compelling talk that challenged the notion that personal information is on a binary spectrum of public or private. To help underscore her points, she recalled and discussed a number of major privacy blunders from Facebook and Google. You can find my notes from the presentation below.Boyd says that privacy is not dead, but that a big part of our notion of privacy relates to maintaining control over our content, and that when we don&#8217;t have control, we feel that our privacy has been violated. This has happened a few times recently.How The Buzz Launch FailedAs a first example Boyd brought up Google Buzz. She says that nothing with the launch was technologically wrong â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you could opt out of Buzz, elect to hide your friend list, and so on. But the service resulted in a PR disaster because Google made non-technical mistakes, doing things that didn&#8217;t meet user expectations:Google integrated a public facing system in one of the most private systems you can imagine. Lots of people thought Google was exposing their email to the world.Google assumed people would opt out if users didn&#8217;t want to participate. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help but notice that more technology companies think it&#8217;s ok to expose people tremendously and then back pedal when people flip out&#8221;, she says.You want to help users understand the proposition. You need to ease them in, invite them to contribute their content.Boyd says that years ago, researchers noticed people in a chat room would often ask &#8220;A/S/L&#8221; (age, sex, location). So some services, looking to streamlines things a bit, started building user profiles that had this information. What they failed to understand is that this &#8220;A/S/L&#8221; was a sort of chatroom icebreaker. Users lost that, and putting that information in a profile â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0even if they would have shared it to answer that chat message â\\x80\\x94 could creep them out.With Buzz, Google found the social equivalent to the famous &#8220;uncanny valley&#8221; (where things seem almost natural, but aren&#8217;t quite close enough, so they&#8217;re creepy). They collapsed articulated networks (email) and assumed it was a personal network.Boyd then transitioned to talk a bit about the fuzzy lines between what is public and private.  She says that just because people put material in public places doesn&#8217;t mean it was meant to be aggregated. And just because something is publically accessible doesn&#8217;t mean people want it to be publicized.The Facebook Privacy FailBoyd&#8217;s second case study was Facebook&#8217;s privacy changes in December, when Facebook changed &#8216;everyone&#8217; to the default. We&#8217;ve written extensively on thisÂ\\xa0fiasco, which may take years to really reveal the extent of the damage it has done.Facebook said 35% of users had read the new privacy documentation and changed something in the privacy settings. Facebook thinks this is a good thing, but it means 65% of population made their content public.  Boyd has asked non-techie users to tell her what they thought their settings were. She has yet to find a single person whose actual privacy settings matched what they thought they were.Boyd recounted a story of a young woman who had moved far away from an abusive father. The young woman talked with her mother (who had moved with her) about possibly joining Facebook. They sat down to make the content as private as possible, which worked well.  But in December, the young woman clicked through Facebook&#8217;s privacy dialog (as most people did) and had no idea her content was public. She only found out when someone who should not have seen the content told her.Boyd then discussed how different groups of people think about privacy. She says that teenagers are much more conscious about what they have to gain by being in public, whereas adults are more concerned about what they have to lose.As an example, Boyd talked about a teenage girl who often putÂ\\xa0risquÃ©, sometimes illegal content online. When Boyd asked why she&#8217;d want to doÂ\\xa0something, theÂ\\xa0girl replied, &#8220;I want to get a modeling contract just like Tila Tequilla&#8221;. HerÂ\\xa0calculationÂ\\xa0wasn&#8217;t about what she couldÂ\\xa0potentiallyÂ\\xa0lose, but rather what she stood to gain.Boyd says that most techies think about Personally Identifiable Information, but that the vast majority of people are thinking about personally embarrassing information. People often share private information with their friends in part because it allows them to bond, it makes them somewhat vulnerable and establishes trust. But when it&#8217;s through technology (e.g. Facebook&#8217;s public by default setting) it&#8217;s a huge technology fail.Boyd also called out the presence of racism in social media. On the night of the BET awards last year, all of the trending topics were dominated by terms relating to the event and the black community.  In response, some Twitter users made very racist comments â\\x80\\x94 clearly even these open communication platforms are still prone to hate.To conclude the talk, Boyd pointed out some of the challenges we will continue to face with regard to privacy online.  She asks whether or not teachers can be expected to maintain a professional, pristine presence online â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0something that is very difficult to do while leading a normal life.Ultimately, she says, &#8220;neither privacy nor publicity is dead, but technology will continue to make a mess of both.&#8221;  We&#8217;ve been looking at privacy and publicity as a black-or-white attribute for content, when really it&#8217;s defined by context and the implications of what we&#8217;ve chosen to share.Image by Adam Tinworth',\n",

The true virtue of Pixelpipeâ\\x80\\x99s service is the fact that it lets you publish all types of files to various social networks and sites from a centralized place. And the startup offers its service on mobile devices, including a nifty Android app, as well. Using Foursquare&#8217;s API, Pixelpipe now allows you to add check-in to a location with a link to media captured at the venue, which is hosted on your Pixelpipe Page. And you can check-in to a location with media (text, photo, video, audio or a file) with Pixelpipe&#8217;s Android app. Pixelpipe will present a list of venues to a user. The number after the venue represents the number of recent check-insFor example, if you are at SXSW, you can record an audio clip or video and post the media long with your check-in to the Austin Convention Center. The link will lead vistors back to your Pixelpipe landing page.Sort of like a Ping.fm for media, Pixelpipe automatically distributes any new audio files, images, or videos to your profiles on social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and FriendFeed. You can choose to group these services by tags, so you can be more selective about where youâ\\x80\\x99d like to to post the content. Pixelpipe&#8217;s CEO Brett Butterfield tells me that Brightkite and possible Gowalla integration will be rolled out in the future. As the geolocation wars heat up, it seems like web applications and mobile apps, both new and old, are getting into the location game. Hot Potato, SimpleGeo and new startups StickyBits and Social Great have hooked up their applications with Foursquare. And Foursquare competitor Gowalla  upped the ante with a new release.

Foursquare has a firehose of its own, but access to it has been on lock down. Today, for SXSW, Foursquare opened up its firehose a bit more.Social Great, a service which tracks trending places in cities back on location data, has just gotten access to this firehose of data. This allows them to show in realtime the trending places throughout Austin, Texas, where SXSW is taking place. The service also pulls in data from Gowalla, Brightkite, and GraffitiGeo (Loopt).As Polaris Ventures EIR Jon Steinberg notes (who helped build Social Great), &#8220;the numbers look crazy.&#8221; What he means is the check-in data at SXSW. Judging from what I&#8217;m seeing on the ground here in Austin, that may be an understatement. Venues routinely have dozens if not hundreds of other Foursquare users at them when they&#8217;re trending.SimpleGeo, one company that has had early access to Foursquare&#8217;s firehose, built Vicarious.ly to visualizeÂ\\xa0real-time check-ins around Austin. That data looks fairly insane as well. Most of the check-ins appear to be coming from Foursquare (which saw over 300,000 check-ins on Thursday alone) and Gowalla, but co-founder Joe Stump notes that the battle is too close to call still.One other note: all these check-ins are made possible by the fact that AT&amp;T&#8217;s network has been up and working the whole time.

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;re big fans of Animoto, a website that lets you easily create photo and video slideshows matched  to music. The site is constantly innovating its nifty product, most recently adding an iPhone app and the ability to incorporate video. For those not familiar with Animoto, the startup basically allows you to take your images, video and your music and mash them together to create cool videos. What makes the videos cool is the company&#8217;s technology that renders the pictures so they&#8217;re in-step with the music you&#8217;ve chosen, adding nice transition effects. This morning, Animoto is opening up its API, allowing partners to now incorporate Animoto&#8217;s compelling technologies into independent sitesThe first API that being rolled out for the Animoto Partner Platform is Animoto Quickstart.Â\\xa0 The API essentially allows any website to tap into Animoto&#8217;s video creation flow.Â\\xa0 The aim is to make Animoto one click away from any website that has photos, videos or music.Â\\xa0 Quickstart allows websites to connect their own content, including photos, video clips and music to Animoto as the first step in creating an Animoto video.Â\\xa0So partners can integrate Animoto&#8217;s video slideshow creation tool into their sites. And the startup promises that Quickstart takes only hours to a partner to set up on a site. For example, SmugMug, a photo sharing site that caters to professional photographers, uses Quickstart so users can &#8216;pass&#8217; their photo albums into Animoto&#8217;s video creation flow. So the user now has the option of making a slideshow from their hosted photos and simply needs to pick a song to complete their Animoto video.Â\\xa0Once a user clicks to make the slideshow, he or she will be taken to Animoto&#8217;s site, where their video and photos will automatically be placed into Animoto&#8217;s site. Another use case is a promotion Animoto is launching with iconic musician John Bon Jovi where fans of Bon Jovi can go to Bonjovi&#8217;s site to create an Animoto music video with Bon Jovi&#8217;s latest single and footage from his music video.Â\\xa0 Pepsi also used the Quickstart API to help users create video slideshows in a contest involving its ShareTheJoy campaign. With the launch of this API at SXSW, Animoto is partnering with music publication SPIN magazine to allow fans to promote their favorite South by Southwest bands for a chance to win prizes.From now until March 31, 2010, fans can create and submit Animoto videos featuring songs from top South by Southwest bands for a chance to win $1000 and a spot on Spin.com, and other prizes.Â\\xa0Currently Animoto has 1.4 million users and makes money off of its paid subscriptions. On its site its free to create 30 second videos, but you need to pay $3 per video to make an lengthier slideshow. The site sells a year long subscription to users for $30. A large part of Animoto&#8217;s subscription business is composed of professional videographers and photographers who pay $250 per year to create their own branded videos that they can download, and burn to a CD (and the slideshow doesn&#8217;t bear the &#8220;Animoto&#8221; logo). Animoto&#8217;s CEO Brad Jefferson tells me that 10 percent of users, so 140,000 people, are have paid for at least one product on the site.The company is already cash-flow positive, which isn&#8217;t bad for a startup that&#8217;s less than three years old. In terms of monetizing the API, Animoto isn&#8217;t charging any of its partners. In fact, it&#8217;s actually paying its partners in terms of affiliate fees. So if any partners lead new users to the site who end up buying a subscription, Animoto will give the partner a 40 percent cut of the first year&#8217;s consumer subscription fee or $50 of the first years pro subscription fee. The Quickstart API seems to be the first of a few sets of APIs that will extend Animoto&#8217;s technology onto the other sites. It&#8217;s a smart move. While many photo sharing sites have the ability to make slideshows, the technology is not nearly as fun and easy to use as Animoto&#8217;s. And Animoto is undoubtedly a compelling tool for an brand marketer to use for a campaign. Frankly, the possibilities are endless because Animoto is such an easy tool to use.

And tonight we&#8217;ve heard that Jeff Webber, the engineering director that oversees the email, instant messaging and other &#8220;communications&#8221; platforms for MySpace, resigned earlier this week as well to join a startup. He&#8217;s been at MySpace for nearly three years and was one of the star engineers and leaders, says one source.Other recent departures &#8211; VP and General Manager of Mobile John Faith, SVP User Experience Katie Geminder and most of her team. And of course CEO Owen Van Natta. And lots more as well, only a few of which we&#8217;ve reported.The company has no direction, says everyone we talk to at MySpace except the top execs, and internal politics are the only thing that seem to matter. Ambitious new projects like Remaking MySpace have been thrown away just because the wrong exec supported it. Anyone who actually wants to build products has left or is looking for a new job, say many, many sources.If you&#8217;re a MySpace employee and feel differently, please contact us anonymously. Because right now all we see is a ton of fluff and absurdity coming from the top, and massive morale problems at the middle management ranks. The title of this post is actually a recent quote from a (now former) MySpace employee, and it seems to be accurate. They say a company has to hit rock bottom before it can even think about rebuilding into something new. If that&#8217;s the case, the time to start rebuilding is, apparently, right about now.

Maybe 10 really worth checking out. But right now is a bit of a weird period in e-reader history. The Kindle cemented e-readers in the consumer headspace, catapulting them from weirdo alternative technology to mainstream gadget. That&#8217;s what the iPad threatens to do with tablets &mdash; we&#8217;ll see about that. But the Kindle and the iPad are two important forces in the current e-reader wars; the question, upon the answer of which depends the success of many a device, is whether &#8220;bonus&#8221; features like second screens and weird form factors in e-readers will be enough to differentiate them from the high-profile devices pressing them on both flanks?Take a second to imagine it as a battle between three armies. On one side of the field is the steadfast Kindle Corps, seasoned and numerous. On the other is the glorious Apple Brigade, untried in e-reader combat but veteran of other battles. In between them is a menagerie of Sony, Asus, and miscellaneous independent mercenaries, bristling with foreign and barbaric weapons, gathering together only because they don&#8217;t stand a chance by themselves. In real life, they are not gathered at all, but that doesn&#8217;t work with the metaphor. Maybe they have a non-aggression pact or something, I don&#8217;t know. Regardless, the battle is about to begin.See, the vast majority of e-readers were designed as a response to the Kindle, not to tablet computers, which may or may not obsolete e-readers altogether. It&#8217;s a bad situation: the whole time you&#8217;re improving your competitor&#8217;s product, someone else is skipping your entire device class on the grounds that it will be made ridiculous by their awesome gadget. Some of the special features developed to combat the Kindle will stay, and some won&#8217;t live to see their own first birthday.Personally, I think e-readers will stick around next to tablet computers, since it&#8217;s just as much of a problem for a device to do too much as it is for it to do too little. You may not want your e-mail and browsing device to be the same as your reading device. And of course the Kindle isn&#8217;t the end of all readers: the generation currently being released has among its members a few interesting features&#8230; and a few duds. Let&#8217;s take a look.The nook is what people think of when this type of e-reader is brought up, and for good reason. It&#8217;s a sexy little bugger. Now, compare it to its rivals: the upcoming Spring Design Alex and the Entourage Edge. What do you see? A larger secondary screen. Better, right? Unfortunately, the secondary screen does two things that pretty much sabotage the idea.First, it takes away from the readable area (the main screen); 90% of the time you are using an e-reader, you are reading. That is the device&#8217;s stated purpose. When you put in a secondary screen, you are subtracting from the functional part of your device. I think it&#8217;s an unstated but obvious goal of design that your device should primarily do what it does.Second, it implies uselessness on the part of the e-ink screen for UI stuff, and suggests to the consumer &#8220;If you want to do stuff other than read e-books, you&#8217;re better off with a device that&#8217;s all secondary screen.&#8221; It&#8217;s like admitting a strike against your product before the consumer even sees it. Bad idea.Not to mention having a color LCD screen raises the cost of the device considerably. It is for these reasons that I think the secondary screen is a one-generation fluke, not likely to be seen again after 2010.There actually aren&#8217;t many that fall under this category, but they are on their way, and I believe this is something that will stick around. Depending on the technology used (Mirasol, pigment pores), there may be no downside to having a color screen other than cost. That is to say that reflectivity, weight, responsiveness, contrast, and resolution will remain the same, except now you have color (however washed out in these first devices).As I said, there are practically none of these devices on the market right now. Asus has an OLED-based one it wants to push, but at six inches it&#8217;s not very tempting, and of course it&#8217;ll be expensive. And it&#8217;s more of a tablet anyway, so it gets ignored. But you can bet that Amazon, Sony, and every other company is pushing display R&#038;D like none other trying to get color e-ink to work for a decent price. We&#8217;ll probably have a few announcements this year, but no products until next CES.On the other hand, we already have Pixel Qi, which may beg the question of color e-ink before the latter is even viable. On that front, we have the popular Notion Ink Adam, demoed here, which is one of the few devices which genuinely falls under both the e-reader and tablet categories. Personally I&#8217;m bullish about it, though I&#8217;m afraid it may crumple under the combined pressure of Amazon and Apple, both of which will be gunning for it.At any rate, color is here to stay. Whether it&#8217;s an unexploited e-ink technology or a hybrid like Pixel Qi, you better believe that color will huge in the next year. Not only does it open up capability for running some applications, but it also lets the device and creator tap into the huge academic book market, which needs color. Believe me, I wouldn&#8217;t have passed my Neuroanatomy classes with a black and white textbook.Are you kidding me? Almost every interactive device in the world is going to be touchable by the end of 2010. Any e-readers that don&#8217;t have this feature by the holidays are going to be laughed at long and hard. Touchscreens you can write on are going to be key as well; if your e-reader can replace the &#8220;back of the napkin&#8221; sketches, diagrams, and calculations you do already, then hell, why not?The Entourage Edge needs another mention here, since it has that book-like format, but as I noted before, that actually ends up being a weakness. You&#8217;re splitting your functionality and essentially the user can only use half the device at any given time, and is all the while thinking &#8220;Man, I wish the other half of this thing didn&#8217;t exist right now.&#8221; The Courier, which obviously is not e-reader but tablet, solves this by having both sides active at all times. Not possible for the Edge.Here&#8217;s a tough one: the Samsung E6. Its slider form factor reminds one of their slider phones &mdash; this thing in particular. But there are plenty of objections here. You see it and immediately think, &#8220;an e-reader with moving parts? No thanks.&#8221; I mean really, simplicity is key with a device that&#8217;s meant to replace a paperback. And anyone will be able to tell you&#8217;re doing something wrong when you need a whole huge sliding mechanism just to reveal a D-pad and a couple buttons that could easily have been put where the Samsung logo is. And the speakers are on it too! What the hell, guys? Well, we can all agree that the E6 is going to sell about three units. I think sliders are out.But what about a sliding QWERTY keyboard? I haven&#8217;t seen one of those yet, but I&#8217;m afraid it might have the same issues as the E6. Besides, better displays means better on-screen keyboards. These things aren&#8217;t meant for typing anyway. Leave it to tablet computers to figure this out.What about ultra-slim? Hey, why not? My favorite e-book reader out there is the Plastic Logic Que, for no other reason than that it&#8217;s slim and handsome, just like me. Seriously though, a touchscreen (however primitive) and a thin, refined design will sell against the most robust competitors, and the Que is refined as all hell (though sadly, delayed). If someone really and truly just wants to read books and magazines on an e-ink screen, they don&#8217;t want or need anything else, but they do care whether it looks like they&#8217;re reading a gigantic BlackBerry or not. Slim, buttonless designs will stay. You can be sure the next Kindle will have one (though will likely keep its signature side buttons).Flexibility? The Skiff is working at this, and it&#8217;s something e-ink and (kind of) OLEDs are uniquely capable of at the moment, but I get the feeling it&#8217;s going to end up on the low-end devices. See, as long as a consumer is paying $400 or so for a device like this, I think that for the time being, they are going to want build quality that suggests that. They want glass, metal, rigidity, sturdiness, all that. Until you can actually roll or fold up your e-reader, I don&#8217;t see this being a big selling point. But don&#8217;t count it out completely; this feature isn&#8217;t dead, it&#8217;s just sleeping.Another tough one. I don&#8217;t have a problem with Android on e-readers &mdash; it adds a little credibility somehow, and I&#8217;m sure there are going to be a few apps (if there aren&#8217;t already) that are meant to run only on e-readers, for customizing this or that, or finding free books. If Android is to be the de facto OS of e-readers, so be it. I feel that Chrome OS will be too much for an e-reader, so it doesn&#8217;t pose a threat, nor any of the other mobile or free OSes. They could just as easily run a different Linux-based OS, but Android has name recognition and probably some handy 3G and mobile wi-fi stacks.There is the issue, however, that in some devices Android does more to show what the device is not capable of than what it is. Look at this little thing from Gigabyte. The OS looks completely out of place there, and is a mess to navigate.As for Apps in general, well, I think we&#8217;ll see a basic stable of apps develop &mdash; things that are applicable to e-ink screens, probably features that the creators should have included. Most e-readers don&#8217;t have the kind of displays or usage patterns as other Android devices, so lots of the Marketplace will be pointless. And as for other apps, I guarantee anything worth getting will be integrated into the second generation of the reader as a native function. Color screens and better responsiveness might change this (as would a Pixel Qi rout) but for now I&#8217;m saying Apps aren&#8217;t going to win any battles. Besides, Apple&#8217;s got them licked there.It should be noted that there are plenty of perfectly nice-looking e-book readers out there that are not &#8220;special&#8221; in any way. Look at this Asus one. Doesn&#8217;t it look nice? Yes. But the competition will bury it unless it&#8217;s stupid cheap. The Kindle clones will disappear because the vanilla Kindle form factor and feature set will start to show its age to casual consumers this year, especially as alternative and open book stores begin to proliferate (options!) and alternative e-readers penetrate the collective attention bubble. And of course you can expect a totally new device from Amazon this year as well, though they got a bit of a late start.And what will be the effect of the iPad on all this? I don&#8217;t want to say much on this, because there&#8217;s still a lot to be learned about that device. I said earlier that e-readers will exist alongside tablets for some time, and I stand by that. If people really like to read books on a device of this form factor, I doubt the iPad (or similar devices) will be their only device.Personally, I&#8217;m sticking with books, and looking forward to tablets as a way to read newspapers and magazines, which obviously require color and a net connection, neither of which is a guarantee with the current or impending generation of e-readers. I&#8217;ll be interested to see how my predictions fare against reality, but I think I&#8217;m on solid ground with most of them.',\n",

Here&#8217;s your chance: MyBrandz is a new community site that looks to let people talk about their favorite brands with other users, allowing them to share their favorite products, photos, and more.  You may remember MyBrandz as the company that convinced a guy to tattoo the YouTube logo to his arm a few months back.My initial reaction to the site was that it was a bit bizarre â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0is there really an audience of people who want to talk about how much they love these multibillion dollar corporations (many of which couldn&#8217;t give a hoot about their customers)?  And then I remembered the throngs of die-hard Apple fans that police internet forums, and the Ferrari store in downtown San Francisco that sells $200+ leather jackets emblazoned with the classic logo.  Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely an audience for this.Once you&#8217;ve browsed to the fan page of the company you like, you can share notes, photos, video, and links with like-minded fans. To help boost engagement, the site is currently running a promotion that invites users to &#8216;own their brand&#8217; â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0the top user for a given brand site will win a free stock certificate. The site is happy to point out that &#8220;a Google share is worth more than $600 and an Apple share over $200&#8243;, but doesn&#8217;t go out of its way to say that the top user on Playboy&#8217;s fan page can expect a windfall of $3.58.The site has some nice touches, like a scrolling wall of logos to help you quickly build out a roster of your favorite brands, and a graph that plots the ranking of brands based on their market value and popularity. But, as with most social sites, it&#8217;s going to face a chicken-and-egg problem.  And many of these brands have already spawned their own communities and forums â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it&#8217;s going to be hard to get those to migrate to MyBrandz.Brand fans may also want to check out Logorama, the brand-studded animated short that just won an Oscar.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Mobile social networks have tremendous potential to flourish in developing countries where mobile phone usage trumps internet connectivity. SMS based social networks like SMSGupshup have gained considerable traction in Asia because of this. For example, in India, there is currently a 10 to 1 mobile-to-PC ratio. Mig33, a mobile social network that involves VoIP calls, instant messaging, e-mail, text messaging, and picture sharing, has accumulated 35 million registered users of its service and is growing fast in South Asian markets such as Indonesia and India. Assuming 3 to 10 percent are active on a monthly basis, that would be 1 million to 3.5 million active users.  Mig33&#8217;s users are now sending over 1 million virtual gifts a month, and posting approximately 100 million messages a day on its network, or 1,000 messages every second. Twitter, in comparison, just passed 50 million a day.  Mig33 is eying the virtual gift economy as a revenue maker because of the model&#8217;s success for China&#8217;s similar application, Tencent QQ. According to Mig33, the Chinese mobile social application has nearly 8% of its over 500 million users in China paying about $2 per month in virtual gifts and goods. Mig33 is hoping to emulate that model in markets like Indonesia, India, South Africa, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Bosnia. Mig33 is available worldwide and optimized for more than 2,000 different mobile devices. The startup has steadily added to its app by integrating social games, user-owned groups, virtual gifting and, most recently, avatars. Avatars are actually a source of revenue for mig33, by charging users to customize and enhance their avatars. Mig33 is looking to expand the virtual economy.  In fact, the startup says that its revenue stream has grown to over $1 per user per month in countries such as Indonesia and India. Founded in 2005, mig33 is backed by Accel Partners, Redpoint Ventures and DCM and has raised a total of $23.5 million. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Sometimes it is obvious where the world is headed, but some people and industries become frozen in place and time.  They are like the duckbilled dinosaurs happily munching on the still-abundant plants around them when the meteor strikes instead of the small furry mammals underfoot who take cover every day by natural habit.  In the print newspaper industry, it&#8217;s the same story.  Everyone wants to wall off the Web and keep grazing on declining ad revenues.A week ago, I wrote a post based on a conversation I had with Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen in which he made the case that print media companies would be better off shutting down their print operations now (&#8220;Burn the boats&#8221;) and move forward unencumbered into the digital age, no matter how painful that may be.   That suggestion hit a deep nerve, and continues to do so.  Just yesterday, Allan Mutter, who writes the blog Reflections of a Newsosaur, took exception to Andreessen&#8217;s advice.  By his estimate, in 2009:Print-driven newspaper revenues still are running at better than $30 billion a year.  It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t take a certifiable Silicon Valley genius to see that no business can walk away from some 90% of its revenue base without imploding.Mutter&#8217;s indignation is typical of the response to the article, even among enlightened newsosaurs.  But that is exactly what Andreessen is saying.  As I noted in my original post, he is quite aware that &#8220;at risk is 80% of revenues and headcount&#8221; (or 90%, if you take Mutter&#8217;s numbers).  Yes, the Internet media business is much less lucrative than the print side, and may never replace it in terms of the revenues it generates.  But Andreessen&#8217;s point is that the meteor is on its way and the sooner that media companies start looking for cover, the more likely they are to survive.He is not trying to be an alarmist.  He&#8217;s just a realist.  In the technology industry, similar disruptions happen all the time.  The companies that survive are the ones that adapt and jump onto the next wave of technology before the one they are on finishes cresting.  So the real question is one of timing.  How long will it take that $30 billion print business to go to $20 billion, $10 billion, or zero?  No doubt, it will take years, probably decades.  But how long do print media companies wait before they leave their old business behind?The people who read print newspapers and magazines are getting older and older, while advertisers always chase the young and impressionable.  That audience is already on the Web.  And they are no longer satisfied with getting all of their news from one or two trusted sources.  They get their news from all over the place: newspaper sites, TV news sites, blogs, Twitter, Facebook.  More and more, the news is coming to them through their friends and the various streams they consume.  The old days of cross-subsidizing political news with ads from the Travel and Auto sections are over.  The longer media companies wait, the bigger disadvantage they will have when they cross over to the other side and find a whole new host of competitors who never had any print legacy businesses to protect.  Those competitors right now are blogs and online news hubs who are still furry little rodents in the underbrush, but who won&#8217;t stay little forever.  The sooner print media companies cross over, the sooner they can be on pure offense.  Their online strategies and business models won&#8217;t be crippled by any allegiance, or need to protect, to the old print business.  If they wait until their online revenues become 25 or 50 percent before they fully commit, it will be too late.  But that is probably what will happen.  Media companies are still surrounded by $30 billion worth of leaves that look mighty good.Photo of duckbilled dinosaur fossil by Ed Schipul .',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Brightkite is tricky. Tricky and smart.While larger than most of their location-based rivals with over 2 million users, they know that in the past year they&#8217;ve lost some momentum to the newer check-in services like Foursquare and Gowalla. So they&#8217;re trying to do something unique to swing momentum back in their favor.Today, at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Brightkite is unveiling its new Group Text service. It&#8217;s both a feature on the website and a standalone application in the App Store (it should be available shortly). With it, Brightkite is latching onto one of the most popular and fast growing categories in mobile applications: group texting. Unlike regular text messaging, this type of app allows you to message many people all at once (and go back and forth). And better, in a world where cell providers are still managing to rip-off users with their text message bundles or $0.15 rate per-text, group texting is absolutely free.Services such as textPlus have already made the functionality very popular on the iPhone, and now Brightkite hopes that will translate into converting different types of users over to its core location-based service. The reason is that built-in to the Brightkite Group Text app is the core Brightkite functionality itself. While it&#8217;s a bit buried to the left hand side of the menu, you can both check-in at venues, and get check-in updates from other users in the app.It&#8217;s a smart play. As other location services such as MyTown have proven, there&#8217;s a market to get users outside of the traditional early-adopter crowd into location by doing something novel (in their case, a straight-up Monopoly-type game). Group texting users seem to be rabid about the software, so why not give them a little location-based bonus to play around with if they desire?At the same time, this app provides a nice compliment to the Brightkite service itself. With it, users get another social outlet to communicate with, sending messages or pictures, and having them threaded both in the app and online. And yes, it still works with traditional SMS messaging, as Brightkite was lucky enough to be granted a texting shortcode (41414) and it can work with these threaded conversations. For example:By adding three digits to the end of the code, each person can now have 100 simultaneous threaded text conversations running on their phone.41414-001 = conversation 141414-002 = conversation 2And thanks to the SMS support, you can contact anyone in your address book, not just those using the app.The service is now live on Brightkite&#8217;s site, and look for it later today in the App Store.

       "  'comments_content': 'Last night, we wrote about a CauseWorld teaming up with TechCrunch to provide double karma points during the SXSW festival starting today in Austin, Texas. These points, obtained through checking-in at various locations, can be used to donate to charities through big brands that support the app. It&#8217;s a great feature, and we hope you&#8217;ll use it in Austin. What we didn&#8217;t talk too much about is the app itself that enables it, CauseWorld, which just released a new version of its iPhone app in the App Store.We first covered the app back in December, but now it has been significantly upgraded. One of the core ideas behind the app has always been the intersection of the mobile and physical world (something I&#8217;ve thought a lot about as well). A new feature bridges the gap a bit more as you can now scan barcodes on individual items with your iPhone to earn extra karma points. Proctor &amp; Gamble are the ones sponsoring these points on different products they make. It&#8217;s a good idea, because even if you choose not to buy the item, it forces you to pick it up and look at it a bit.This feature points to the bigger idea that CauseWorld parent Shopkick is thinking about when it is ready to launch its flagship product (CauseWorld was born as just a trial site of an idea, but quickly ballooned into an app with over 300,000 downloads). It&#8217;s the idea thatÂ\\xa0the cellphone is the only interactive tool you carry in a non interactive setting at all times. So why not use it to make the physical retail space more interactive, Shopkick CEOÂ\\xa0Cyriac Roeding reasons.Another huge addition to the CauseWorld app is a social layer. Previously, the app was all about what you did. But now you can hook it up to Facebook (which will earn you bonus karma points) and share the progress and donations you&#8217;re making with your friends. On top of this there are new features such as gifting which will help the app virally spread through social networks.This social layer also allows for a leaderboard to be created showing which of your friend have donated the most karma points. Sometimes social pressure is the best way to get people motivated.Again, CauseWorld stems from trying out an idea to see what would work with the larger Shopkick plan when that eventually launches. But the response to it has shown Roeding enough that he believesÂ\\xa0&#8221;the next big thing after the check-in is the check-out.&#8221; Given the big brands they&#8217;re signing up to support CauseWorld, he just might be right.You can find the new CauseWorld 1.5 in the App Store here.

Now, FunMobility has caught the Twitter bug and is launching FunTweet, a web service which turns any Twitter stream into visual messages that are related to the text.  Similar to FunMail, FunTweet will turn text in Tweets into a matching image. On FunTweet&#8217;s site, you sign in with your Twitter credentials and the service will draw your Tweets from your Twitter homepage feed and display each tweet as a FunMail image on FunTweet. Users can also enter a @UserName, a HashTag or a Subject as well to the images. If you like the image FunTweet picked, you can publish the Tweet to your Twitter account. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t like the image, click â\\x80\\x9cTry Againâ\\x80\\x9d and you can choose from other images. For example, if you tweet about writing a story or reading a book, then FunTweet will come up with images that match &#8220;story&#8221; &#8211; a book, a magazine, a typewriter, or a pen. FunMobility is hoping FunTweet can be a display tool for parties, conferences and other gatherings where live stream messages may be projected. I find myself wishing I could include my own pictures into my FunTweets so I&#8217;m hoping the site will soon include that functionality. FunMail for the iPhone has gained a bit of traction in a short amount of time with 100,000 downloads since its launch in November.

       "  'comments_content': 'This is the lede, verbatim, from a story that appeared in The Hill yesterday: &#8220;The Internet allowed extremists to contact, recruit, train and equip the suspect responsible for the attempted Flight 253 bombing on Christmas Day &#8216;within weeks,&#8217; a top Pentagon official told lawmakers Wednesday.&#8221; What&#8217;s the implication, that because someone used the Internet to plan something, something bad, we should get rid of it? Fine by me, believe me.You&#8217;ll recall that, last Christmas, some guy had attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a U.S.-bound international flight. He wasn&#8217;t successful, but the botched attempt sparked a new round of fear in the country; full-body scanners now dot the landscape. The Pentagon, speaking before Congress, pointed out how the Internet greatly sped up the planning and execution of the attack. In a period of only a few weeks, the bad man was contacted by other bad men, trained, supplied, and sent on his way. Compare that to the 9/11 attacks, which were first authorized in April, 1999: the Internet wasn&#8217;t as mature then (so we&#8217;re told: no, there was no Twitter or Facebook in 1999, but there certainly was e-mail and IRC and message boards and instant messaging and so on), so it took al-Qaeda a quite a bit longer to organize everything.But that&#8217;s the thing: the Internet is merely a tool. Blaming it for terrorism would be like blaming Home Depot because one of their hammers was used in a robbery. For example, up until a few weeks ago, I didn&#8217;t know how to use a french press. A couple clicks later and I&#8217;m basically a barista&mdash;maybe I should move to Seattle! I used the Internet for Good, not Evil: I educated myself.Other Good things I&#8217;ve used the Internet for:&bull; Learn the Russian alphabet&bull; Learn how to tie a tie&bull; Download, legally, a CM Punk vs. Samoe Joe match&bull; Kept myself sane by playing World of Warcraft a lotSee? It&#8217;s a tool. It is what you make of it. That&#8217;s why seeing the Pentagon basically allude to it being a Very Bad Thing is sorta frightening.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Sonos has now confirmed the Index Ventures investment we reported two days ago. The company has taken an additional $25 million in capital from Index, raising the total raised by the company to $65 million. And Index Ventures Partner Mike Volpi, a former CIsco executive, has joined their board of directors.The funds will be used for growth equity, says the company, which signals that they are past the proof of product stage (well past, in this case) and will use the funds to speed market penetration.From our original post:Volpi will bring real expertise to the Sonos board. As recently as 2007 he ran an $11 billion routing and access products busines for Cisco.  He clearly knows how to sell products at scale.Sonos has been around since 2003 and has raised some $40 million from private angel investors and BV Capital. Until last year the company sold very high end music products that users loved passionately, but the mutli-thousand dollar price point for a complete system made mainstream penetration difficult.But in 2009 Sonos began selling a new product, the S5 music system, that users control via their iPhone. The S5 is just $400 and has driven &#8220;massive growth&#8221; says the company.Like Flip last year, Sonos likely had a choice between selling now or raising new money for major expansion. Flip sold to Cisco. Sonos, it seems, is taking more money, but adding an ex-Cisco exec as well. Perhaps they&#8217;ll get their cake and eat it, too.CrunchBase Information',\n",

You&#8217;ve been waiting on this thing since December 2008, after all.We know you&#8217;ve already bought two for yourselves, the limit, because that&#8217;s how TechCrunch readers roll. We know this because we&#8217;ve told our advertisers that every single one of our 9.2 million monthly readers is a high disposable income influencer in technology and media that just loves to try out new things that they see advertised on TechCrunch. And since those advertisers believe us, we have the means to buy an extra iPad and give it to you. Even though you&#8217;ll then have three of them. Because you, dear reader, are a high disposable income influencer.Anyhow back to the iPad. This isn&#8217; the 3G version, which comes later in April. This is the 16GB Wifi iPad, a $499 retail device, that we&#8217;ll give away to one lucky reader chosen at random who comments below or retweets this post. Just fan the TechCrunch Facebook page and then do one of two things: either retweet this post, and make sure to include the #crunch hashtag, or leave a comment below telling us why this device must be yours. The contest ends at noon California time on Saturday. Please only tweet the message once, anyone tweeting repeatedly will be disqualified. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll pick a winner tomorrow afternoon and contact you for more details. Anyone in the world is eligible, as long as you can receive delivered packages (our Nexus One winner lives in Romania). And we&#8217;ll throw in a TechCrunch tshirt.Update: The winner and runner up have been chosen randomly and have been contacted.

       "  'comments_content': 'Last August, we wrote about Lunch.com, a reviews site that&#8217;s setting out with the goal to make the world a better place by changing the way people think about each other (as I wrote then, it&#8217;s a pretty lofty goal). Today, the company is launching a new feature called Communities that lets users build their own review sites around any niche topic. If you&#8217;d like to try founding a community, you can do so using the beta code &#8220;techcrunch&#8221;.The new feature can be likened to a &#8216;Ning for review sites&#8217;.  As a community founder, you select a topic on whatever you&#8217;d like, then invite other users to contribute reviews and other content (you can elect to moderate this as it comes in).  For examples, check out Strollerland, a new community that&#8217;s dedicated to reviewing strollers.  There&#8217;s also Gluten Free Groupies, for (surprise) people who like to talk about gluten-free foods.The benefits of this kind of niche-community setup are clear â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0if you cater to a group of people passionate about a given topic, they&#8217;re probably going to be more knowledgeable and engaged than your average user. I&#8217;d rather take recommendations from someone who reads about strollers all day than from a guy who liked the one he chose at random at Wal-Mart.CEO J.R. Johnson says that Lunch&#8217;s system allows for the creation of multiple communities around the same topic (for example, there could be ten different reviews communities that revolved around bicycles).  Because all of these niche review sites are built on the Lunch.com platform, the site can use its universal search and suggestion engine to recommend content you may be interested in, even if it&#8217;s found on a different community than the one you&#8217;re currently browsing.However, it sounds like new communities may have some trouble getting off the ground. Â\\xa0Johnson says he expects that lots of the niche review sites will be launched by existing online communities (say, a Yahoo Group). Â\\xa0For them, the system should work well, but if you just want to launch a review site about stamps but don&#8217;t already have many friends who are interested in the topic, you may have trouble getting much traction. Â\\xa0That said, these niche communities will be exposed to search engines, and if you produce relevant content Lunch&#8217;s recommendation engine should also help introduce your community to new users.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A few days ago, we spotted Twitter&#8217;s initial roll out of a geolocation feature on its Website. It appeared that Twitter was testing the feature because it quickly turned it off.  Last night, the feature went back on, and Twitter co-founder and CEO Biz Stone officially announced it. While Twitterâ\\x80\\x99s geolocation feature has been live through its API since last November, this is the first time Twitter has enabled geolocation on its site. To start Tweeting with your location attached, you need to enable the feature in your Twitter Account Settings. Once you&#8217;ve opted-in, you will be able to add your location information to all your Tweets or choose to add them to individual Tweets as you compose them. You can choose to share your exact location (your coordinates) or your neighborhood or town. Currently, the feature only works with Firefox 3.5 and Chrome for Windows.  If you decide you want to send a Tweet without your location, you can simply click the &#8220;x&#8221; next to your location to disable it. Interestingly, if you Tweet with your geolocation on Twitter, the location doesn&#8217;t seem to show up in TweetDeck, Seesmic or presumably other third-party clients.   And It doesn&#8217;t work from Twitter&#8217;s mobile site, at least not on the iPhone, where it would make more sense.As we wrote in our earlier coverage, the timing of this move by Twitter is purposeful. With the SXSW conference in Austin starting today, the location wars are heating up. Earlier in the week, the New York Times reported that Facebook would unveil its answer to location next month at its f8 conference. Google, meanwhile, is in the game with Latitude and to some extent Buzz (but could have been in it a lot more). And of course, Foursquare, Gowalla and a host of other location-based apps are rolling out additional functionality. As we previously noted, many of these apps use Twitter&#8217;s geolocation API to pass the data back to Twitter, so it makes sense that this would be a good time to turn the functionality on for the website.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s Note: This guest post was written and reported by Steven Rosenbaum, the CEO of Magnify.net.Today, the world of music, film, and the internet converges on Austin, Texas for what is fast becoming one of the key places to launch new software products.  For the folks at AOL, South By Southwestâ\\x80\\x94known also as SXSWâ\\x80\\x94will be a debutant party for AOLâ\\x80\\x99s new Seed form of journalism.AOL has it&#8217;s hopes pinned on that fact that SXSW will be the perfect place to both introduce the new Seed content machine to a large audience and test the concept of mixing freelance and pro-journalists to create a huge amount of original content.   Seed has been operational for a few months now, but SXSW will be it coming out party, according to former New York Times writer Saul Hansell who is now the Programming Director of Seed.How&#8217;s this all going to work?  Well, fielding an army of freelancers to cover SXSW&#8217;s 2000 bands is certainly a baptism by fire.  AOL solicited freelance writers on its music site Spinner.  Those interested in contributing were redirected to Seed, where they signed up.  Hansell asked for work experience, music tastes,  and clips.  He says: â\\x80\\x9cI can tell you now that we didnâ\\x80\\x99t read the clips.  We looked at these things to see if people can follow directions and if they didnâ\\x80\\x99t write us 1,000 words when we asked for 100.  And that was the criteria.&#8221;Next, each of the more than two thousand bands that will play at SXSW were assigned to a Seedster to interview.  Hansell says he had his fingers crossed.  &#8220;I think weâ\\x80\\x99re over the hump of my darkest fears,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and I had many of them.  The first dark fear was weâ\\x80\\x99d get total losers. The second fear was how good the interviews would be. â\\x80\\x9cNow, with first results surfacing on Spinner, Hansell says, â\\x80\\x9cThe people who sent us e-mails back were entertainment writers for weekend publications, kids in J-school who are also in bands, exactly the right type of people.â\\x80\\x9d  But they aren&#8217;t treated exactly like journalists.  Hansell points out that Seedsters donâ\\x80\\x99t get a press passâ\\x80\\x94if they want to hear the bands live theyâ\\x80\\x99ll have to buy their own ticket.  But he expects some number of folks to try and hustle their way into shows by waving around their AOL clips.  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s just expected.â\\x80\\x9dWith clips like these, Seed writers are held to the same standards as any other freelancer on the AOL site. AOL Music&#8217;s managing editor Melissa Olund and her team edit the submissions and have final say on what runs and what doesn&#8217;t.Why launch at South By Southwest?  For Hansell, that was a no-brainer. &#8220;I know it is communicating our ambition. We are about reporting. We are about doing big and interesting things.&#8221;  The big SXSW bet is that Hansell and his Seedsters can make more content, faster, better, and cheaper than anyone else.  In addition the distributed community of potential contributors on Seed, AOL already employs 3,500 professional journalists on staff or as regular freelancers.  And AOL has some interesting content search technology from its earlier acquisitions of Relegence and Truveo.  Man vs. Machine: The Bionic SolutionAOL has built a three legged stool to create content: part professional, part freelance, and part aggregated . . . but its model is far more hand-crafted than the other new players in the mass content creation space.  â\\x80\\x9cThe essence of journalism has always been separating signal from noise,&#8221; says Hansell. &#8220;It&#8217;s all judgment. It&#8217;s all selecting the best bits.&#8221;  What AOL hopes to create with Seed is an editorial machine which automates the assignment process as much as possible, but keeps the final selection part in human hands.&#8220;I call it Bionic Journalism,&#8221; says Hansell. &#8220;Left brain, right brain. We are trying to take the best of a machine, which does lots of things over and over again, and a person.â\\x80\\x9d  It&#8217;s a tall order, and will take a lot more than a couple thousand band interviews to prove it works.Is AOL trying to beat Google at the news gathering game?  Hansell says it&#8217;s far more than that. &#8220;Google News will give you a whole clump of things that are probably about the same thing with a reasonable degree of accuracy. But it can&#8217;t tell you what it&#8217;s really about. It can&#8217;t summarize it. It can&#8217;t translate it into people language.â\\x80\\x9dThe Ugly Economics:  Not My ProblemSo, what about cost?  Some freelancers are complaining that the web doesn&#8217;t pay a living wage. &#8220;That is not my problem&#8221; Says Hansell.  He quickly rephrases, &#8220;It is my problem but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t do that, the world did that.â\\x80\\x9dHe is however trying to sort it out.  Asks Hansell: &#8220;How do you deal with the fact that the economics of the Internet can&#8217;t let you pay what people think that a freelancer can get paid?  One way is you give them a bundle. If you give them ten of the same assignments, even if the price is low, by the time they&#8217;re done with the tenth one, they can do the tenth one in half the time they could do the first one.&#8221;Here&#8217;s another one of Hansell&#8217;s analogies: &#8220;Seed is to freelancing as Ebay is to classified ads.&#8221;  AOL&#8217;s Seed may be the future of freelance, but the math remains daunting; &#8220;The fact that we gave somebody ten interviews to do after she did one or two before, she&#8217;s delighted. That&#8217;s 500 bucks. That&#8217;s 500 bucks more than she was going to make doing something else, and it&#8217;s fun.&#8221;  Well, &#8220;delighted&#8221; might be pushing it.  Pumping out ten assignments for the price of what many professional freelancers charge for one will favor quantity over quality.But if it all worksâ\\x80\\x94if Bionic Journalism can attract a massive audience and save AOLâ\\x80\\x94what&#8217;s the home run?  Here Hansell gets a little bit ahead of himself, but at least he is thinking big: &#8220;It&#8217;s the most high risk improbable outcome, but the most exciting, which is that we become the most dominant force in journalism, broadly defined, in the Twenty-First Century.  That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re shooting for. That&#8217;s what Tim is shooting for. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m shooting for.&#8221;And it all starts this weekend with 2,000 indie rock band interviews.Steven Rosenbaum is the CEO of Magnify.net, a video curation platform that powers more than 68,000 web sites.

As much you guys think we rail against Apple, we&#8217;re like abused puppies, slinking back to our master&#8217;s hard ankles, shivering and awaiting praise. Why did I pre-order the iPad? Well, first I&#8217;m a gadget blogger. Second there is no certainty that mother Apple will grace us with an early review unit so I want to hedge our bets. Third? I want to see where computing is headed.Bear with me here. Apple is not the bringer of fire to a benighted world. Far from it. In my recent writing I&#8217;ve been struck by a few parallels with Steve Jobs to Abraham Louis Breguet, a French watchmaker who lived in the 18th century. He was a mechanical genius, to be sure, but he was also a salesman. While the rest of the benighted world was sloshing around in an admixture of feces and mud in the streets of Paris and telling the time by whether the pikemen were stabbing them for being out after curfew, Breguet was selling watches that would not be out of place on the wrist (had they had straps) of a whale in Las Vegas. He invented secret anti-counterfeiting measures but made them part of the allure and not part of a DRM scheme. He designed elegant and beautiful watches in an age of rococo designs but wasn&#8217;t above creating a &#8220;subscription&#8221; watch for the masses who wanted to own a piece of the good life without paying an exorbitant sum of money. Other watchmakers were making commodities and following Breguet&#8217;s lead. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.Like Steve Jobs, Breguet knew what his hipster, nobler-than-thou audience wanted and he supplied it. Sure it was expensive and sure it wasn&#8217;t generally popular but he made a boatload of money and in the end moved on to explore new avenues of inquiry, improve the general perception of scientific precision, create new forms of telegraphy, and his kids even became pioneers in airplane design. Linux and Windows geeks often put Apple down for locking things up but I say I can do more in the OS X command line terminal than I ever was able to in the Windows DOS window. I usually installed Unix tools under XP just to get any work done when I ran Windows. Look at the watch above. It was one of the most complex watches in the world when it was made. It came with two dials &#8211; the crystal one you see and a while enameled on that hid the innards. If you put the white enamel dial on that watch, you&#8217;d have four visible hands. That&#8217;s it. It was as austere and beguiling as an early iPod. You saw it, you knew what it did, but there was nothing to get in the way of reading the time or, the the case of the iPod, playing your bluegrass albums. Behind it &#8211; complexity &#8211; in front &#8211; elegance. I&#8217;m also not saying the iPad is the Marie Antoinette Watch of our day. It&#8217;s definitely not. I would wager that our current business climate does not allow for the sort of advances in the state of the art that the MA represents. Sure, there are better watches right now, but the MA was finished in 1827 using tools little removed from what was available in the previous three centuries and by 1900 watchmaking was a dead art and is now, at best, relegated to shoe repair bodegas that also specialize in watch battery replacement. The MA wasn&#8217;t just a watch, it was that generation&#8217;s mechanical moonshot and the ultimate steampunk artifact. Nothing Apple has done is worth that level of praise.Also nothing &#8211; and I mean nothing &#8211; about the iPad is particularly new or particularly appealing to the geek in me. It&#8217;s a slate that I&#8217;ve seen countless times running an OS that is underpowered at best with a trade dress that we&#8217;ve seen a thousand times. But the whole is great than the sum of its parts. Apple is about to change how I browse the Internet in the bathroom, on the couch, and on the train. I bought a WiFi enabled model because I figure I&#8217;ll have WiFi more often than I&#8217;ll have 3G coverage with AT&#038;T (HAR!).So anyway, flame on, flame warriors. I&#8217;m sticking by my decision. Did you pre-order?',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Recently, startup Cc: Betty, a nifty service that organized and managed group email threads, decided to rebrand and relaunch its service.  The new product, Threadbox, was going to be streamlined and tweaked to appeal to workspace users.Today, Threadbox is officially launching in private beta, as a more collaborative and user-friendly service. Essentially, the site aims to combine email, IM, and collaboration tools into one platform. Instead of focusing on email like Cc:Betty, Threadbox centers around collaboration in the workplace. The service organizes and logs every type of communications with clients, allows users to share documents and images, and record decisions and feedback. The new service also has the ability to serve as a project management tool, allowing users to share and track requirements and specs, then track and follow team members from start to finish.Additionally, Threadbox aims to serve as a communications tool between employees, with the ability to gather comments, opinions, exchange feedback, share documents and media on the same page. You can add maps, files start conference calls from within the platform. And as the service&#8217;s name implies, all communications are threaded and organized according to client and subject. Threadbox still incorporates elements of Cc:Betty&#8217;s technology. You can received notifications of thread activity and reply to threads directly from your email client. It&#8217;s unclear if the service will integrate with social networks, like Twitter and Facebook. The basic Threadbox service is free but the startup offers a premium product for $19.95 per year. Cc: Betty raised $500,000 in December of last year, and has $2 million in total funding now. With Threadbox the startup is clearly making a play towards the work user; I&#8217;m doubt the average consumer will find the service as appealing as Cc:Betty was for personal use. But collaboration is the key word in enterprise-focused products at the moment, so Threadbox will certainly catch the wave of small to medium sized businesses which are looking to upgrade their communication platforms. However, this is a crowded space with many worthy players so the competition, which includes Yammer, Chatter, Jive, Socialtext, WizeHive, and many more products, will be tough. Here&#8217;s a video from Threadbox that goes into more detail about the new service:    CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Kwedit, the innovative and suddenly controversial payments platform for virtual goods, is releasing some early data. The service lets users promise to pay later in lieu of a direct credit card payment when they want virtual currency for social games like Farmville. It&#8217;s not a legally binding promise, but users have an incentive to pay amounts owed because that allows them to get more virtual currency through the service. Users can pay by, among other methods, mailing in cash or paying at a 7-11.When the product first launched they had no idea what percentage of promises would be repaid. Anything at all is incremental revenue to game publishers, and since the stuff they&#8217;re selling has no marginal cost (virtual currency), it&#8217;s all upside. But after nearly two months of being live, they say the repayment rate is 25.9% If you&#8217;re a credit company that would put you out of business. But for game publishers, that&#8217;s a staggeringly attractive monetization option. Hopefully the company (or its partners) will also disclose the monetization rate as well down the road. Because right now game publishers are only able to get cash out of 1-3% of users. If they can get another few percent to pay via Kwedit, and 25% of that money is actually paid, revenue from games can double or more.It&#8217;s controversial because Colbert made fun of it, and then the Huffington Post and CBS jumped on the bandwagon. CBS actually called it &#8220;toxic.&#8221;Founder Danny Shader posted a long response here. But the short version is this &#8211; the criticism is ridiculous. It&#8217;s coming in one case from a competitor (the Huffington Post article was written by the CEO of a company that promotes Visa cards to teens and adults, without any sort of disclosure on the conflict). And the author of the CBS article doesn&#8217;t appear to actually understand the product and seems more concerned with getting parents all worked up.The really scary stuff in social games was the Scamville nonsense where teens and pre-teens where being tricked into putting long term subscription charges on their parent&#8217;s cell phone and credit card bills. Kwedit isn&#8217;t even close to that kind of evil. It&#8217;s simply a very clever way of monetizing social games, and the most innovative new payments product I&#8217;ve seen in a very long while.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;ve talked a lot this week about the so-called &#8220;Location War&#8221; brewing at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas starting tomorrow. That war will happen, but actually, there are likely to be a lot of winners because a few of the location-based services should be able to leverage the exposure to gain usage after the conference. Those with real bloodlust should probably be watching another war: AT&amp;T versus everyone in Austin on their network.AT&amp;T&#8217;s struggles to stay up last year are well-documented. CNN recently ran a piece about how AT&amp;T hopes to avoid a similar fate this year. But actually, &#8220;struggles&#8221; is way too kind of a word. If you were at SXSW last year and happened to be on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network â\\x80\\x94 like, say, if you had an iPhone, like many festival-goers did â\\x80\\x94 it was an absolute nightmare. You couldn&#8217;t make a call. You couldn&#8217;t send a text. Data? Ha. At a few points early on I seriously wondered if I had forgotten to pay my bill and AT&amp;T had simply shut my phone off â\\x80\\x94 except that it was happening to everyone.AT&amp;T has a funny word for the failure, they like to say it was &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221; As in, the usage of its network was at levels previously unseen, as a strong percentage of the over 10,000 festival goers (just the interactive part) were using iPhones. Well guess what? Word is that is year, there will be some 15,000 people there for the interactive part.Â\\xa0As Samual L. Jackson&#8217;s character, Mr. Arnold, says in Jurassic Park, &#8220;Hold on to your butts.&#8221;I&#8217;m leaving for Austin tomorrow and I&#8217;m terrified of what the AT&amp;T situation will be when I get there. So much so, that I have a back-up plan (which Sprint sent me just in time to test out during SXSW after reading some of myÂ\\xa0rants against AT&amp;T). With attendance up as much as 50% from the previous year, the number of iPhones in use is sure to be through the roof as well. Did I mention that just about every location-based service known to man is launching an app at the event and hoping every single one of those 15,000 people use it all the time? And based on the early signs, they intend to.You&#8217;ll remember that after Mr. Arnold says the above line in the movie, he&#8217;s savagely ripped limb from limb by a velociraptor.But there may be hope for AT&amp;T. They&#8217;re clearly well aware of the failure last year, and did try to solve the issue to minimal effect towards the end of the conference. I asked a company representative what they&#8217;re planning to do this year, and they have a plan of attack.Much of what they sent me is fairly technical, but basically, they now have a system around the Austin Convention Center (where SXSW takes place) that&#8217;s the equivalent of 8 cell sites, with 50 antenna nodes to cover the whole venue. Also, they&#8217;ve greatly expanded network capacity, moving from one radio network carrier to three, boosting the spectrum available for phones to use. They also say they&#8217;ve expanded the capacity of the so-called &#8220;high quality&#8221; 850 MHz spectrum, which works better indoors because those signals can go through walls more easily. They also have the new HSPA 7.2 software installed at all of the 3G cell towers now. But don&#8217;t be confused: that doesn&#8217;t mean their network has been upgraded to 7.2 Mbit/s speeds (sadly, at the peak, it&#8217;s still half that in almost all of the country), it just means that the upgraded software is in place and should be more reliable and efficient.But there&#8217;s more. AT&amp;T has brought in two Cells on Wheels (the so-called COWS that they brought in to help last year), and also a third rooftop temporary cell site. Each of these are equipped with both 3G and WiFi networks to help alleviate overall network strain. AT&amp;T says these three cells are placed in optimal positions around the city of Austin where they expect the most strain.All of that sounds great, but I&#8217;m still terrified. Why? Because I live in San Francisco. AT&amp;T has known for months that the network is awful here, and while there have been baby steps taken to improve it in some areas, more often than not, it&#8217;s still awful. Take tonight, for example. So if AT&amp;T knows it&#8217;s bad here, but still can&#8217;t seem to fix it, why should I believe Austin will be any different? I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll just have to hope I&#8217;m wrong.Or I&#8217;ll have to kick back, relax, and take joy in the bloodbath as iPhones are magically turned into glistening bricks being hurled in anger left and right. As I boot up the Sprint Hotspot, of course.    [photo: universal pictures]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': '[France] Zimbalam, the digital music distributor from Believe Digital, launches in the US today.The service lets artists submit and distribute their music through 25 of the most popular music platforms, including Apple&#8217;s iTunes and Spotify, in addition to &#8220;several hundred additional stores worldwide&#8221;. This makes Zimbalam the largest music distribution network as measured by number of stores and geographic reach, says the Paris-based company.To distribute their music via Zimbalam&#8217;s network, artists are charged a simple annual fee ($29.99 in year one then $19.98 per year after for an EP or album) and then once the fee is recouped, get to keep 100% of royalties &#8211; after, of course, whatever commission is taken by each store. Additionally, following year one, artists won&#8217;t be charged by Zimbalam if they don&#8217;t make enough sales to cover the annual fee.As well as music distribution, the service provides real-time (daily) sales data, CRM tools, such as email newsletters, and a widget feature for promotion through social networking sites. The latter is geo-targeted and can detect a userâ\\x80\\x99s location so as to promote the most popular music stores in that region.Another potential pull for artists who are considering using Zimbalam for digital distribution is the link between the service and its parent Believe Digital, which is backed by a team of 50 A&#038;R people. Those that perform strongly on the Zimbalam network and are therefore deemed to have &#8220;breakout&#8221; potential will be assigned a personal A&#038;R manager to advise on &#8220;release strategy, marketing and promotion investment&#8221;, bridging the gap of a major record label.Believe Digital is backed by VCs xAnge and Ventech to the tune of $8.5 million and is founded by music executives from various companies, including Vivendi Universal, MP3.com, eMusic, BMG Entertainment and Sony. It has a staff of 70 spread across six European countries (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal), as well as the United States.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The official Foursquare account just sent out a tweet letting everyone know that today is already the service&#8217;s biggest day ever. This is interesting since it&#8217;s actually the day before the SXSW conference kicks off in Austin, Texas.According to the tweet, Foursquare broke 275,000 check-ins (the previous record, set last Friday) for the day &#8220;hours ago.&#8221; This means they&#8217;re very likely well past 300,000 now and perhaps even higher. To put that in some perspective, just a month ago, Foursquare set a record with 1.2 million check-ins for the entire week. And that was double was it was the month prior. At today&#8217;s rate, Foursquare would be doing well over 2 million check-ins a week.Today happens to be the first birthday of Foursquare, so they shared some numbers earlier. The service now has over 500,000 users, they&#8217;ve given out over 1 million badges, there are over 1.4 million venues in the system, with over 1,200 specials available. And in total, there have been some 15.5 million check-ins. But that was before today&#8217;s record numbers.While there are well over a dozen location-based services launching something at SXSW, the main two competitors vying for users&#8217; time are expected to be Foursquare and Austin-native Gowalla. For its part, Gowalla noted that it was &#8220;Amazing to watch the Gowalla action on the eve of SXSW. AMAAAAAAZING!,&#8221; earlier today. Both recently revamped their websites, and both yesterday launched their new iPhone apps. And judging from the Vicarious.ly data provided by SimpleGeo, both are absolutely on fire right now and could go nuclear this weekend.Update: Gowalla has a range of just about every possible venue you can imagine for SXSW and so far (again, the day before the conference), they&#8217;ve seen 352 check-ins at the SXSW Badge Pick-Up alone.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Many of them allow you to &#8220;check-in&#8221; places to let others know you are there. So how do you differentiate between then and decide which to use? Well, here&#8217;s one good way.CauseWorld, is a free iPhone and Android app that lets you check-in places, but it has an added real-world bonus: big brands give money to charity when you do so. And this week at SXSW, CauseWorld is teaming up with TechCrunch to offer double point (which they aptly call &#8220;karma&#8221;) when you check in to one of over 50 venues around Austin (I&#8217;ll paste the full list at the bottom of the post), including the Austin Convention Center (where SXSW is held).We&#8217;ve covered CauseWorld, which is the first offering from the soon-to-launch ShopKick, a few times now. It&#8217;s a great product because it takes an area that is red hot right now, location-based check-ins, and converts it into good deeds in the real world. For example, if you check-in at a store, you may earn 20 karma points. As you continue to accumulate these, you can turn them into real dollar donations for causes such as water in Sudan or trees in the Amazon. Brands such as Kraft Foods and Citi are currently giving the donations based on what users choose to trade their karma points for. The best part is, you don&#8217;t even have to buy anything â\\x80\\x94 you simply check-in at various venues and earn the points. And again, this week at SXSW, checking-in with the app at a bunch of venues will earn you double karma points.And like any good service with a gaming element, there&#8217;s a leaderboard to show who has donated the most karma points. And yes, checking-in can earn you badges, such as the TechCrunch one show in this post.So if you&#8217;re going to be in Austin for SXSW this week. Or really, if you just want to do some good with your mobile device, check out CauseWorld. Find it in the App Store here, or in the Android Market (on your Android device).

       "  'comments_content': 'Back in November of last year, the location-based social event service Hot Potato launched at our Realtime CrunchUp. Today, they&#8217;ve taken what was a solid service, and made it a lot better with a number of upgrades.First and foremost, there is a new iPhone application that just went live in the App Store. With a completely revamped user interface, the app makes it easier than ever to find and participate in events. Perhaps more importantly, it makes it really easy to create new events â\\x80\\x94 and notably, the service has the nicest third-party Foursquare integration I&#8217;ve ever seen. When you click on the button to create an event, you can still manually enter a location, but if you happen to be around the venue, you can simply pick it from Foursquare&#8217;s list of venues with the click of a button. This drastically simplifies the event creation process since the venue metadata is already there.This new app will be crucial for the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, which starts tomorrow. If you&#8217;ve been reading TechCrunch over the past week, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly seen that just about every location-based service has an app they&#8217;re unveiling. And another service based around planning events, Plancast, just launched their app this evening. But Hot Potato offers the best of both worlds as it allows you to both plan future events, and interact with ones currently taking place. The new app makes it very easy to chat about the event, and upload photos and videos.And they&#8217;ve cleaned up the stream of information around these events. There is now a filter to show everyone commenting, or just your friends. There are also now number indicators to show unread items. And the check-in process has been simplified thanks to big green buttons that make it obvious.Also new for SXSW is Twitter integration. On a case-by-case basis, Hot Potato will be pulling in tweets about certain events at SXSW, using a filter to make sure only relevant ones show up. You&#8217;ll be able to do things such as filter those tweets to show only those by people you actually follow, which will make them potentially much more meaningful to you. You can also reply to tweets thanks to integration of Twitter&#8217;s API. And you can share tweets from within the app that will show up as retweets on Twitter.Another new features is Calendars &#8212; something which each Hot Potato user now has. Obviously, you can add the events you wish to be a part of to your calendar, but people you are friends with on the service can also add you to other events as well.Â\\xa0The app also now features Push Notifications now (on top of revamped email notifications).On top of the new app, Hot Potato has rolled out a completely revamped website with just about all of the same functionality of the new app (as well as the new look and feel). And at the highest level, Hot Potato finally has its own social graph, which can pull in friends from the usual suspects: Facebook, Twitter, your address book, etc.And here&#8217;s something that should really help Hot Potato this week: each time someone checks-in to a SXSW event with Foursquare, that service will recommend they also join the event on Hot Potato. Clicking on the accompanying link provided in the Foursquare app with open the Hot Potato app and let them join the event with a click (if they have an account). As you might expect, you can also check-in to a venue on Foursquare within Hot Potato. With Foursquare likely to be one of the key apps used by conference goers, this cross promotion is simply huge.On top of all of this, the service now has its own full API, so others can use and interact with their data.Simply put, all these updates are full of win, and make a good app even better. And remarkably, they&#8217;ve managed to cram in all these new features while at the same time simplifying the overall experience.Fine the new iPhone app here in the App Store. It&#8217;s a free download.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s getting tough to keep up with all of the location-related developments leading up to this year&#8217;s SXSW, and they just keep coming.  Tonight, on the eve of the event, Plancast has just had its iPhone application approved. The service, which we&#8217;ve previously described as a &#8216;Foursquare for the future&#8217;, allows you to tell your friends where you&#8217;re planning to be as opposed to where you currently are (in other words, it lets you and your friends plan ahead).  You can grab the new iPhone app here.The application itself looks solid, and includes the core functionality you&#8217;ll find on the Plancast website.  The main view allows you to scroll through a list of your friends&#8217; upcoming events, and tapping on an event will show you where it is on a map and who else is going. At SXSW, where there are always many panels and parties going on, this can come in handy â\\x80\\x94 sometimes it&#8217;s more practical to plan ahead than it is to walk across town when you notice a few of your friends are checking in somewhere. Â\\xa0One feature I&#8217;d like to see is a way to get push notifications when a bunch of friends are planning to attend the same event (e.g. &#8220;Hey, your friends are all going to Salt Lick in a few hours!&#8221;); hopefully we&#8217;ll get something like that in the next release. There&#8217;s also a mobile version of the site available for users on other mobile platforms.Plancast was founded by TC alum Mark Hendrickson, and recently closed an $800,000 seed funding round that included a bevy of well known angels like SoftTech VC, Dave McClure, and Joshua Schachter.For other SXSW-related location news, see Loopt&#8217;s new iPhone app, Gowalla&#8217;s new app, and Vicarious.ly, a new app from SimpleGeo that brings all of this location data together.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This morning Google announced a new Blue Dot feature on the mobile version of Google Product Search that shows whether a product is in-stock at nearby stores. This seems to pose a threat to startup Milo, which highlights local inventory in product search results both on the web and mobile devices. Milo&#8217;s co-founder Ted Dziuba subsequently responded to our post with a Tweet that read &#8220;Google Product Search has availability for 5 retailers vs. Miloâ\\x80\\x99s 49. Super cool web service, bro.&#8221; At launch Google only has  partnerships with Best Buy, Sears, Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, and West Elm. Milo&#8217;s list of merchants includes a range of retailers, from BestBuy and Nordstrom to Midwestern regional department store Blain&#8217;s Farm and Fleet. When we asked for an additional response, Milo sent us this amazing set of pictures below. Milo&#8217;s Palo Alto office&#8217;s are located at 165 University Avenue, in the same space as Google&#8217;s first office back in 1999. Look closely at the picture and you may even see a few of the famous faces from Google&#8217;s original team. The building itself is legendary in Silicon Valley and has also housed PayPal. Here&#8217;s a 2007 New York Times article detailing the building&#8217;s history and apparent lucky karma. The picture of the Google employees was given to Milo by one of its investors. \\t\\tMilo CEO and co-founder Jack Abraham was quick to respond that they are not implying that Milo is the next Google, but just meant to inject some light-hearted humor into the situation. In all seriousness, Abraham said that Milo has a tremendous amount of respect for Google and its Product Search but aren&#8217;t scared of the search giant entering the market and actually welcomes the competition. Abraham and his team have been working for the past two years to scale their product and feel that their offering is more comprehensive than Google&#8217;s Blue Dot specials. While Milo is steadily expanding its merchants both regionally and nationally, the startup is also looking to partner with mom and pop shops in cities. Currently, Milo indexes 2 million products.And Forrester reports that the &#8220;online research, offline buying&#8221; consumer market represents $917 billion in consumer spending, which is 30 percent of all U.S. retail sales. Online, e-commerce spending accounts for less than 5 percent of U.S. sales. With those numbers, it comes of no surprise that Google wants a piece of the pie. But perhaps there&#8217;s enough room for a number of players to monetize from this space. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Apple has set the standard that once every year they will release a new version of the iPhone. It stands to reason that this year will be no different, with a new model likely coming sometime this summer. But arguably just as important as Apple&#8217;s hardware refresh is the accompanying software refresh that comes with it as well. And that&#8217;s why it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising at all that whispers of iPhone OS 4.0 are starting to grow. But this year, the timeline appears a bit off.As AppleInsider reported today, iPhone OS 4.0 is likely to deliver multitasking support. If true, that will make it perhaps the most important OS upgrade for the platform yet. However, in reporting the news, AppleInsider also notes that the software, &#8220;remains under development and reportedly has a quite &#8216;way to go&#8217; before it&#8217;s ready for prime time.&#8221; Looking back at the iPhone OS SDK history you&#8217;ll notice a constant: Apple has released the beta builds in March the past two years. We&#8217;re already well into March this year, and so far, no word about Apple being close to doing the same.In fact, last year, Apple held its iPhone OS 3.0 preview event (where it first made a beta available) on March 17. I remember this well because I was unable to attend as I was at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. I also remember when Apple sent out the invites to that event, March 12, because I wrote up the report about it on my way to the airport to leave for Austin. But the difference last year is that there were whispers leading up to that announcement that there would be some kind of event in March for the iPhone OS. This year, so far, nothing.Now, it&#8217;s possible that some of the speculation about the new iPhone OS release has been muted because of the recent iPad unveiling, and it&#8217;s upcoming launch on April 3. But that very launch also adds fuel to the fire that we won&#8217;t be seeing an iPhone 4.0 OS anytime soon. After all, Apple is currently in the process of rolling out the beta builds of iPhone OS 3.2 (currently on beta 4), which is the OS the iPad will apparently ship with.The launch of the SDK is important because it gives developers time to get their apps ready for any big changes coming. And multitasking seems like it would be a pretty huge change, though it&#8217;s not entirely clear if most of the work would be done through the OS itself to optimize how app resources are managed, rather than apps having to do that themselves to be deemed &#8220;multitasking ready.&#8221; Hell, it&#8217;s not even clear if any iPhone beyond the inevitable new one will be allowed to let third-party apps run at the same time as the new hardware will undoubtedly have a faster processor (possibly the A4 found in the iPad), more RAM, and maybe even a better battery â\\x80\\x94 all of which will be crucial to multitasking.I&#8217;ve spoken with a few developers and none have yet seen any part of the iPhone 4.0 OS. A few have gotten word from the company that it is indeed coming, and that big changes are in store (which had led me to speculate about background running in the past) but have no idea when that will be. Apple, meanwhile, has been thinking about how best to let third-party applications run in the background on the iPhone for about a year now.It seems unlikely that Apple would launch a new iPhone OS without giving developers plenty of time to play around with it. And since there is no word about the 4.0 SDK coming anytime soon, that could well mean a push from the usual June/July timeframe for a new (final build) iPhone OS launch. Might we see new iPhone hardware that launches with OS 3.2? And then iPhone OS 4.0 would be released as a free upgrade closer to the Fall timeframe? It certainly seems possible.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As I&#8217;ve made abundantly clear over the past several days, just about every service that has anything to do with location is launching something at the SXSW festival which starts tomorrow in Austin, Texas. Don&#8217;t believe me, here&#8217;s a small sampling (Foursquare, Gowalla, Loopt, Whrrl, Plancast, Brizzly, Twitter). So, how are you going to wrap your head around all this location data? SimpleGeo has an awesome way.Vicarious.ly is a real-time location-based stream of information presented in a nice visual way. While the plan is to eventually launch one for many different cities around the U.S. and eventually the world, the first one is based around Austin, for SXSW. To make it, SimpleGeo partnered with BlockChalk, Brightkite, Bump Technologies, Flickr, Fwix, Foursquare, Gowalla, and Twitter to pull all of their location data and place it both in a constantly-updating stream, and put data points on a Google Map at the top of the page. These data points are represented by the logos of the various companies, so it&#8217;s easy to follow visually.Those concerned about the privacy implications of this need not worry, Vicarious.ly doesn&#8217;t pull actual user names from the companies mentioned above. Instead, they simply note that &#8220;someone&#8221; checked-in at a venue. They do, however, give the venue name, which is a hyperlink. So if someone just checked into Stubb&#8217;s Bar-B-Q in Austin on Gowalla, you&#8217;ll see a link back to the Gowalla page for that venue. Likewise, if someone uploads a geotagged picture to Flickr, you&#8217;ll see a thumbnail of the picture in Vicarious.ly&#8217;s stream, and clicking on it will take you to that picture&#8217;s Flickr page.It&#8217;s fairly amazing to see just how much activity there is even today, the day before the conference starts. Tomorrow and the weekend should be insane. &#8220;The amount of real-time, location-based information we&#8217;re indexing is staggering. Â\\xa0We wanted a powerful way to showcase that, so we built Vicarious.ly and targeted the launch to coincide with a massive gathering of geeks,&#8221; co-founderÂ\\xa0Matt Galligan says about the project.You&#8217;ll note just how much of the activity are check-ins from either Foursquare or Gowalla. Those two are likely to be the two main competitors in the location war that will take place this weekend. (If you&#8217;re surprised not to see tweets in the stream, it&#8217;s a bug that SimpleGeo hopes to squash tonight).For more on SimpleGeo, which has a powerful set of tools to easily provide geolocation infrastructure for other companies (such as the new hot startup, StickyBits), check out this and this.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Since then it has gained nearly 2 million users, say Aol. Based on that success Aol is now launching Lifestream as a standalone product at lifestream.aol.com.Like Friendfeed, Lifestream aggregates a number of third party social networks &#8211; Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Foursquare, Delicious, Digg, Flickr, YouTube, etc., so if you follow a Lifestream user you&#8217;ll see all of the content that user publishes on those networks, and Lifestream automatically pulls in content from people you already follow on those various social networks, so you don&#8217;t have to create yet another new friend list. Lifestream isn&#8217;t yet integrated with Google Buzz, but Aol says it may be coming soon.Users can filter out content from specific networks if they like, on a per user or broad basis. A way to think about this &#8211; &#8220;noise cancellation for social networks.&#8221;Lifestream also lets users publish back to social networks. Status updates posted to Lifestream can be posted back to Facebook, Myspace and/or Twitter. Lifestream also optionally notes your location in your status updates via GPS on mobile devices, or you can manually add it instead.That&#8217;s not it though. Users can sign in to Lifestream using their Facebook account via Facebook Connect, making it unnecessary to remember separate account and credentials for the site.You also have a variety of choices in how you use Lifestream. You can access it via the website, an AIR application, or via iPhone and Android applications.  As I said above, the mobile applications are particularly useful because they auto-note your location for easy check-ins, and you can post pictures you take from the phone.That mobile version of the product is what excites me most. You can see where your friends are checking into on, say, Foursquare, click through to a place page and then go there yourself and check in. And Lifestream allows you to follow places just like people, so you can see whenever someone checks in to your local cafe or bar. That ability to follow places is probably the single best reason to use Lifestream.The Lifestream product is simple, intuitive and really, really useful. Frankly it&#8217;s what Google Buzz should have been &#8211; both an independent social network on its own, but very deep integration into all of the other social networks you are likely to use daily. It&#8217;s nice to see actual innovation coming out of Aol.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Google VP of engineering Vic Gundotra previewed the local product search last December, but it is now live.Highlighting local inventory in product search results is exactly what Milo does, although it works on the Web as well as mobile.  Milo will have to try to keep one step ahead of Google now that its business has been targeted as a feature of  Google Product search.The good news for Milo is that nobody really uses Google Product Search.  It is not even highlighted as one of the products on the Google iPhone app, for instance.  Maybe that will change, now that it has a geo-enabled set of results.  When you are looking for stuff to buy, it always helps to know where you can buy an item nearby.

On the seller side, ex-employees of start-ups stepped up their selling activity in February, comprising over 80% of sales, the highest percentage in the past nine months.

Otherwise, just build your own PC, like cool people like me do.But as the family&#8217;s &#8220;tech guy,&#8221; I cannot stress how incredibly infuriating it is to help family members with their computer woes. &#8220;My computer is broken,&#8221; they&#8217;ll tell me over the phone, &#8220;I need you to fix it.&#8221; Sure, let me stop what I&#8217;m doing to try to figure out what the hell is going wrong with your wretched Windows XP installation&#8230;Flickr',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'After shopping itself around to all the major search engines, Radar Networks finally found a buyer in another semantic search startup.  Today, Evri is announcing that it will be acquiring Radar Networks, along with its core technical team and its main product, Twine.  Rumors surfaced yesterday on ReadWriteWeb that Evri was being acquired, but that is not the case.  Evri is the acquirer.I spoke with both CEOs this morning.  They would not disclose the terms of the deal, but it is safe to assume that it was largely an equity-based transaction.  Both Evri and Radar Networks share Paul Allen&#8217;s Vulcan Capital as their largest shareholder.  Radar has raised $24 million in total capital, while Evri has raised $8 million.  (At least that is what has been publicly disclosed.  Paul Allen has poured much more money into Evri almost single-handedly, perhaps even more than Radar raised).  Radar was unable to raise more during the recession and kept pushing out the release of its next product, T2, an ambitious project to create a semantic index of the Web.  Using this semantic index, T2 can do a better job understanding what each Web page it indexes is about.Evri, on the other hand, has been focusing more on filtering the realtime Web and then  creating a semantic index of those pages based on matching similar content.  One of the big drivers of the deal was the promise of combining Evri&#8217;s realtime filtering with T2, which is ideal for more evergreen and authoritative content.&#8220;We had to find a home,&#8221; explains Radar CEO Nova Spivack.  &#8220;Fortunately, we had T2 and a portfolio of fundamentally valuable IP. And user growth is holding steady even though we are no longer working on Twine&#8221;  He also confirmed that he was &#8220;in discussions&#8221; with larger companies.  Why did he choose Evri?  &#8220;At the end of the day, not only was it a better offer, but Evri is more compatible with our team. Joining one of the larger players was a possibility, but it meant we would not get to work on T2.&#8221;  Spivack will be an advisor to the combined company.  He wrote a blog post about the deal.Semantic search is still in its infancy.  Consolidation among startups could give the acquirers more firepower, but eventually the bigger search engines are going to start getting serious.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It&#8217;s actually even cooler than it sounds. By creating robotic shape-shifting mannequins and testing how people reacted by seeing clothes on the robot with their dimensions, sales actually went up. Only 7% of all clothing is sold online today, a $36bn market It&#8217;s $20bn for computers), because you can&#8217;t see how the clothes look on a human body. The fits.me trial with partners showed these pictures of adjustable mannequins wearing clothes increased sales three times and dramatically reduced returns by 28%.Fits.me means customers can try on clothing before buying from internet shops. They can see how different sizes fit their standard size &#8211; like in real-world fitting rooms. The main reason why people do not buy clothing on the internet is the inability to try it on â\\x80\\x93 the virtual fitting room solves this and increases sales. It also reduces returns associated with bad fit, increasing the profits. The cost of returns for a retailer is enormous because of the delay in receiving the returns &#8211; most returns are received back after the season has ended. The virtual fitting room solves this single most important problem for the retailers.Fits.me wants to raise bridge financing of 700k Euro. Check out Fits.me on CrunchBase and DotOpen.

       "  'comments_content': 'With Microsoft becoming increasingly marginalized in areas like mobile media, DirectX is becoming less of a must-use toolset and more of a gaming-specific one. The other side of the coin is, of course, the increasing relevance of standards like OpenGL, OpenAL, and OpenCL: powerful cross-platform systems for graphics, audio, and parallel processing. You may remember OpenCL from its debut on the Mac in Snow Leopard, and OpenGL ES of course powers the UI on the iPad. OpenAL is still a ways from being brought under the public eye, but it&#8217;s getting there. In the meantime, OpenGL 4.0 was announced today at GDC, and clearly it has DirectX in its sights.4.0 has a lot of features which users like you and I don&#8217;t really need to know about. Texture swizzling? Awesome. Tessellation? Sure, as long as it&#8217;s not like whatever they used in Messiah &mdash; remember that game? These new toys for developers will make for a richer and faster graphical experience, to be sure, but I&#8217;m not going to list them off for you.The big news for graphics is handhelds right now. Mobile gaming is blowing up and Microsoft can&#8217;t get a foot in the door. Hell, it&#8217;s getting its foot booted out from the other side. In the other corner, OpenGL (and the rest of the Open toolset) is setting itself up as being flexible enough to be applied on a handset, a laptop, or a desktop. It may not have DirectX 11 fidelity in water shaders or the latest normal mapping technique, but it&#8217;s damn close and what&#8217;s more, it doesn&#8217;t need a high end graphics card to be the library in use. Though I feel I should add that the games coming out on Windows Phone 7 Series and the Zune HD 2 are looking pretty awesome. This race isn&#8217;t over by far.The OpenCL thing is great as well. If you remember, OpenCL is a set of tools for offloading certain tasks from the CPU onto the GPU, when those tasks are better served by parallel processors. Loading web pages may work fine on your Snapdragon, but decoding video will have it at 100% and drain your battery &mdash; better to send it over to the GPU. The GPU computing thing hasn&#8217;t quite taken off yet, but it&#8217;s pretty much inevitable that it&#8217;ll start being implemented on a low level, since it can improve the user experience so dramatically.I&#8217;m always happy to see this kind of steady progress. More capabilities, more competition, and better devices for everyone, OpenGL-based or not. If you&#8217;re interested, there&#8217;s much more information available. Many links in the press release:March 11, 2010 â\\x80\\x93 San Francisco, GDC 2010 â\\x80\\x93 The Khronosâ\\x84¢ Group today announced the release of the OpenGLÂ® 4.0 specification; a significant update to the most widely adopted 2D and 3D graphics API (application programming interface) that is used on all major desktop operating systems.  OpenGL 4.0 brings the very latest in cross-platform graphics acceleration and functionality to personal computers and workstations and the OpenGL standard serves as the basis for OpenGLÂ® ES, the graphics standard on virtually every shipping smart phone.  The OpenGL 4.0 specification has been defined by the OpenGL ARB (Architecture Review Board) working group at Khronos, and includes the GLSL 4.00 update to the OpenGL Shading language in order to enable developers to access the latest generation of GPU acceleration with significantly enhanced graphics quality, acceleration performance and programming flexibility.  This new release continues the rapid evolution of the royalty-free OpenGL standard to enable graphics developers to portably access cutting-edge GPU functionality across diverse operating systems and platforms. The full specification is available for immediate download at http://www.opengl.org/registry.OpenGL 4.0 further improves the close interoperability with OpenCLâ\\x84¢ for accelerating computationally intensive visual applications.  OpenGL 4.0 continues support for both the Core and Compatibility profiles first introduced with OpenGL 3.2, enabling developers to use a streamlined API or retain backwards compatibility for existing OpenGL code, depending on their market needs. OpenGL 4.0 has been specifically designed to bring significant benefits to application developers, including:- two new shader stages that enable the GPU to offload geometry tessellation from the CPU;- per-sample fragment shaders and programmable fragment shader input positions for increased rendering quality and anti-aliasing flexibility;- drawing of data generated by OpenGL, or external APIs such as OpenCL, without CPU intervention;- shader subroutines for significantly increased programming flexibility;- separation of texture state and texture data through the addition of a new object type called sampler objects;- 64-bit double precision floating point shader operations and inputs/outputs for increased rendering accuracy and quality;- performance improvements, including instanced geometry shaders, instanced arrays, and a new timer query.Lastly, Khronos has simultaneously released an OpenGL 3.3 specification, together with a set of ARB extensions, to enable as much OpenGL 4.0 functionality as possible on previous generation GPU hardware, providing maximum flexibility and platform coverage for application developers.  The full OpenGL 3.3 specification is also available for immediate download at http://www.opengl.org/registryâ\\x80\\x9cAMD sees the release of OpenGL 4.0 as another major accomplishment for the OpenGL ARB,â\\x80\\x9d said Ben Bar-Haim, vice president of design engineering at AMD.  â\\x80\\x9cAMD contributes to the Khronos workgroups, and we consistently find that Khronos is successful at developing healthy, thriving, and evolving open standards such as OpenGL and OpenCL.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9cOpenGL 4.0 continues the ARBâ\\x80\\x99s schedule-driven roll-out of new functionality, and this significant major release enables developers to access leading-edge GPU functionality across multiple platforms with full backwards compatibility,â\\x80\\x9d said Neil Trevett, president of the Khronos Group and vice president at NVIDIA.  â\\x80\\x9cOpenGL continues to be a keystone in Khronosâ\\x80\\x99 API ecosystem through driving innovation into OpenGL ES and WebGLâ\\x84¢ to bring high-performance programmable graphics to mobile platforms and the Web,  and by interoperating with OpenCL to create a seamless visual and compute platform for application developers.â\\x80\\x9dLearn about OpenGL at Game Developer Conference March 11-13, 2010Attend this session to learn about the latest updates on the OpenGL standard, and how the OpenGL ARB is addressing the latest graphics hardware capabilities. Also discover how WebGL is bringing OpenGL based graphics to browsers on any platform supporting the OpenGL or OpenGL ES standards, without the need for any plug-in.  Additionally, Khronos is offering sessions on OpenCL, COLLADA, and Khronos Mobile APIs.All Khronos GDC Sessions are in Room 123, North Hall, Moscone Center, San Francisco:OpenCL                           Thursday, March 11         1:30pm â\\x80\\x93 2:30pmOpenGL featuring WebGL         Thursday, March 11         3:00pm â\\x80\\x93 4:00pmCOLLADA featuring WebGL         Friday, March 12         1:30pm â\\x80\\x93 2:30pmMobile featuring WebGL         Friday, March 12         3:00pm â\\x80\\x93 4:00pmAbout The Khronos GroupThe Khronos Group is an industry consortium creating open standards to enable the authoring and acceleration of parallel computing, graphics and dynamic media on a wide variety of platforms and devices. Khronos standards include OpenGLÂ®, OpenGLÂ® ES, WebGLâ\\x84¢, EGLâ\\x84¢, OpenCLâ\\x84¢, OpenMAXâ\\x84¢, OpenVGâ\\x84¢, OpenSL ESâ\\x84¢, OpenKODEâ\\x84¢ and COLLADAâ\\x84¢.  All Khronos members are able to contribute to the development of Khronos specifications, are empowered to vote at various stages before public deployment, and are able to accelerate the delivery of their cutting-edge media platforms and applications through early access to specification drafts and conformance tests.

MyEdu&#8217;s suite of online products try to streamline the entire process of a college student&#8217;s lifecycle, from selecting a college through to earning a degree. The suite includes detailed course descriptions, grade distributions, official course evaluations, and student reviews to pick the right classes; and schedule Planner to build the best schedule that fits a student&#8217;s time constraints and goals. MyEdu also includes a graduation and degree roadmap to help students build a plan and stay on course towards the degree they want in order to graduate. And the academic progress dashboard allows students to track their grades in a centralized place. MyEdu charges a $20 annual subscription for the entire academic suite.The startup, which just raised $5.5 million in funding from Bain Capital Ventures, has a compelling model to help both students and parents participate in the college planning process.

Following up on the Android release of Opera Mobile 4 just over a year ago, Opera has just launched Opera Mini 5 for Android into public beta.The jump from version 4 to version 5 is pretty huge, introducing a handful of features that Opera says &#8220;makes your mobile browsing experience as close as it can be to your desktop experience.&#8221;The biggest change here is probably the introduction of tabbed browsing &#8212; a must, given that just about every default smartphone browser supports it out of the box at this point. Some of the other big new features:Speed Dial: Gives you one-touch access to 9 of your favorite sites. Password ManagerOpera Link: Syncs your bookmarks (and Speed Dial) between your handset and your desktop (be it that you&#8217;re running Opera on your desktop, that is) Is Opera Mini 5 a worthy contender to the default Android browser? I&#8217;d say so. Opera Mini&#8217;s primary selling point is that they pipe everything through a data compression proxy before sending it to your handset. For those days when 3G just isn&#8217;t as fast as it should be, it&#8217;ll save you time; for those of us not on unlimited data plans, it&#8217;ll save some money. Alas, the current Beta doesn&#8217;t support multi-touch, which may very well be a deal-killer for someStill: throw in Opera Mini 5&#8217;s seemingly rock solid build quality and its pretty dang decent UI, and I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s worth giving it a serious test session at the very least.

       "  'comments_content': 'Pelago knows that just about every location-based app in the world is seeking coverage right now just prior to SXSW where they will all battle Highlander-style. So they approached me with a pretty smart pitch: curing the &#8220;social rut.&#8221; What they mean by that is these days, despite the prevalence of social networks, people are actually less social than ever because they&#8217;re being roped into playing games like Farmville and Mafia Wars for hours on end. Sitting in their rooms. Alone.While that may be a part of social networking (a rather large, hugely profitably part), it&#8217;s not really social. That&#8217;s why location-based networks excite me: they have the potential to bridge social networking with actual social activity. And that&#8217;s exactly how Pelago is positioning the latest version of its location-based app, Whrrl 3.The core idea behind the new iPhone app (which launched in the store today) is that people inspire others to do things. So when you see a friend is out doing something fun, you may want to join them. Or it may entice you to go out and do something else, and hope others see it on Whrrl and join in. It&#8217;s the grouping of people with similar interests into &#8220;Societies&#8221; that is a key to Whrrl 3. For example, a basic society is that each venue in the application has its own set of &#8220;regulars.&#8221; If you visit the place enough times, you unlock the badge making you a regular, and giving you access to member-level activities, such as recommendations and specials nearby.One of these societies, launching alongside the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas this week is the Austin Underground which &#8220;will provide members with at-your-fingertips access to the hottest parties, events, and other fun things to do at the conference,&#8221; according to Whrrl. Over 50 merchants in Austin are participating to provide exclusive offers, apparently. To unlock the membership, you have to check-in at some of the following places: Four Seasons Hotel Austin, Outback Steakhouse, Cool River Cafe, Chugginâ\\x80\\x99 Monkey, J Black&#8217;s, Red Fez and Third Base, and others.Other key features of Whrrl 3 include Recommendations â\\x80\\x94 you create these (with photos, if you choose), to let others in your social graph (or your society) know fun things to do in an area. Ideas, are recommendations served up to you from societies you&#8217;re a part of, your friends, or Whrrl&#8217;s algorithms. Fun Facts are shown each time you check-in to a venue, with information about it. And of course, there is a point system (Influence Points) that turn the whole thing into one big game. What&#8217;s interesting about Whrrl&#8217;s game is that you can get point by inspiring others to do things with the app. Points also allow you to level up in your societies for more special deals.All of this is an extension of the &#8220;footstreams&#8221; idea that Whrrl launched last December. That&#8217;s where they also first introduced the society idea as well. The key to both of those is about real people doing real things in the real world. Â\\xa0That, in turn, shows what you&#8217;re interested in, and allows Whrrl to clump you into these groups with out like-minded people.So that all sounds great, but will anyone use the app? After all, adoption has been a problem in the past and this isn&#8217;t the first time Whrrl is pivoting its product. In fact, they actually did exactly a year ago with Whrrl 2 just before SXSW.Their main problem is convincing people to use Whrrl instead of the current location-based darlings, Foursquare and Gowalla. That&#8217;s going to be difficult because those networks are quickly building up social graphs and once those are established, users are less likely to leave. So Whrrl needs something to differentiate itself, and while their pitch to me is good, it&#8217;s an entirely different matter convincing users. And the things that would seem to help differentiate networks like Whrrl actually hurt them sometimes. For example, since location-based services are still new to so many people, it&#8217;s best to keep things as simple as possible. But Whrrl is piling on features that, while maybe cool, are likely to confuse new users.Still, if Whrrl is able to secure some solid deals around Austin to get people using the app and checking-in, that could certainly get people using it. Of course, Foursquare and Gowalla have their own deals too. Then the problem becomes one I&#8217;ve had this past week while testing out all these location apps: fatigue. I can&#8217;t possibly check-in with each of these apps each time I move from place to place. The people I&#8217;m with have started rolling their eyes at me while I take my 10 minutes to check-in to all the different apps.I&#8217;m not saying there can be only one. But one would sure be nice.Find Whrrl 3 in the App Store here. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the last six months,Â\\xa0doubleTwist, the iTunes alternative that lets you manage your music, videos, and photos, has really been stepping up its game. In October the company integrated an Amazon-powered MP3 store, allowing users to download and sync their music directly with any of hundreds of compatible devices, much as they would with the iTunes/iPod combo.  And today it&#8217;s adding a new feature that makes it an even more viable iTunes competitor: support for podcasts.Co-founder Monique Farantzos says that doubleTwist has built and integrated a podcast search engine with 20 times as many podcasts as iTunes offers.  Rankings are based on popularity (as opposed to a simple listing that would grow unmanageable with that much content).  The new feature is launching on Windows now, with Mac support for podcasts coming next month. Â\\xa0Later this year, doubleTwist will offer an API allowing other applications to tap into the podcast search engine. Â\\xa0The company is also planning to launch a client for Android (which would presumably allow users to stream content) over the summer.Farantzos says that doubleTwist is also going to start offering more cloud-based services.  In May, users will be able to store the podcasts they&#8217;re subscribed to server-side, so they&#8217;ll be able to use the same subscriptions on their desktop and mobile clients without having to dock them together.While it supports many devices, doubleTwist is becoming increasingly popular as an &#8216;iTunes for Android&#8217;.  In January, it forged a partnership with T-Mobile, which promotes doubleTwist and has pre-installed it on some devices.  Now, 53% of doubleTwist users are using it to sync with Android phones.  The application also supports syncing with many other devices, including WebOS, BlackBerry, Sony PSP, and digital cameras.doubleTwist is still missing some of the functionality that iTunes has, like the ability to download TV shows and movies.  But the podcast functionality will add some video content, and 1 in 5 users are using it to manage video content they already have. Â\\xa0And some people may even appreciate the added simplicity if they&#8217;re just interested in music. In any case, it probably isn&#8217;t worth holding your breath for doubleTwist to add movies and TV downloads any time soon â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0content owners are still set on wrapping that content in DRM.Also see Songbird, another iTunes alternative (you can see our past coverage here).

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier this year, Google landed a &#8220;landmark&#8221; deal with Global Cricket Ventures, the licensing partner to the Indian Premier League (IPL), which would give them the so rights to live stream cricket matches from the IPL on YouTube. This is a huge deal because the streaming of the 2010 IPL season (which starts on Friday and lasts for 45 days) is the first time a large-scale global sporting event will be streamed; with the reach expected to be at least a half-a-billion viewers. Now of of India&#8217;s largest gaming companies, Indiagames, has bought the official gaming rights to the IPL tournament to deliver games around the Indian cricket tournament. Indiagames will be launching a series of web and mobile apps throughout the next 45 days.

       "  'comments_content': 'Since it launched last July at our Realtime Stream CrunchUp, Brizzly has been one of the best web-based Twitter apps. It offers support for viewing pictures inline, shortened link expansion, multiple Twitter accounts, and even some Facebook support. But they&#8217;ve been quiet in recent months. Now we know why.The Brizzly team went into hibernation because they made a couple of acquisitions, and have been working on a new feature. First, they bought one of my favorite Twitter iPhone apps, Birdfeed. One of the earliest apps to gain Twitter geolocation support, I had been worrying that Birdfeed would go extinct because developer Buzz Andersen recently joined Jack Dorsey&#8217;s mobile payment startup, Square. But since the acquisition (which actually occurred in the November/December timeframe), Andersen has been working closely with the Brizzly team to wrap the app in its new skin.And it&#8217;s more than just a new skin, as Brizzly for the iPhone, the app gained support for posting pictures to the service (or using Flickr), Twitter Lists, and tab editing to better customize the app. Also, if you are on a tweet page that has a photo link attached, you&#8217;ll be able to see a preview of that photo. It&#8217;s a robust client that stands among the best for the iPhone. And it has a bonus feature: News.The News tab on the iPhone app actually ties in to the big new feature for Brizzly itself: Brizzly Guide. Previously, Brizzly&#8217;s website had an area on the side where users could explain the current trending topics on Twitter. Now, that area is a larger site, Brizzly Guide, which gives you more detail about the trending topics. This is actually quite useful as a source of news information because it can tell you both quickly and rather throughly why something is trending. For example, this page for Chuck Norris shows his name is trending because today is his 70th birthday. The page includes images (in this case, of Norris), and links to other relevant information about him. It also has an except from Wikipedia to tell you more.These Brizzly Guides are all community-built, like Wikipedia. Anyone (with a Brizzly account) can edit them at anytime. Top contributors are displayed at the bottom of the Guide site, as are top trends this week. You can also search these guides, to look up previously hot topics.The other acquisition Brizzly made could potentially be very interesting in the long run: Wikirank. Though the service was shut down a little while ago so that the team behind Small Batch Inc. (its parent) could focus on their new project, Typekit (which aims to better fonts to the web), it remained an interesting one. As a visualization and analytics tool for Wikipedia, Wikirank showed data in interesting ways that offered insight not seen on the face of Wikipedia itself. Though Brizzly co-founder Jason Shellen isn&#8217;t yet sure what they&#8217;re going to do with Wikirank, the idea will probably be along the lines of visualization and analytics of this Brizzly Guide information.Shellen also notes that Brizzly signed an enterprise agreement for Typekit so that they can use it on Brizzly Guide.Something else Brizzly has been working on: a new idea called &#8220;Picnics&#8221; (here&#8217;s an example). Basically, this allows someone to pick out tweets from the public Twitter stream and respond to them in a different, but still public, environment. Brizzly tested out the idea the other night during the hit Fox show House (frequent House director Greg Yaitanes is an investor in Brizzly parent Thing Labs), and Fox even promoted it. Actor Jesse Spencer (who plays Dr. Robert Chase on the show) responded to tweets directed at him as they came in.While Picnic isn&#8217;t ready for a full-scale roll-out just yet, Shellen notes that it &#8220;should prove to really transformative for us in the near future &#8211; expect to see more picnics in the future.&#8221;And if all that wasn&#8217;t enough, something else Brizzly has been working on recently: a new round of funding.

Partner Mike Volpi, a forcer Cisco exec who found himself in the middle of a huge drama last year around eBay&#8217;s Skype spinoff, will join the board of directors of Sonos.Volpi will bring real expertise to the Sonos board. As recently as 2007 he ran an $11 billion routing and access products busines for Cisco.  He clearly knows how to sell products at scale.Sonos has been around since 2003 and has raised some $40 million from private angel investors and BV Capital. Until last year the company sold very high end music products that users loved passionately, but the mutli-thousand dollar price point for a complete system made mainstream penetration difficult.But in 2009 Sonos began selling a new product, the S5 music system, that users control via their iPhone. The S5 is just $400 and has driven &#8220;massive growth&#8221; says the company.Like Flip last year, Sonos likely had a choice between selling now or raising new money for major expansion. Flip sold to Cisco. Sonos, it seems, is taking more money, but adding an ex-Cisco exec as well. Perhaps they&#8217;ll get their cake and eat it, too.Sonos wouldn&#8217;t comment on this story.

First and foremost, the overall look has been updated from a sort of Army green, to a more subtle light green that is much easier on the eyes. More significantly, the toolbar has been reworked so that now social activity is front and center when you load the app, while your own activity is the last tab. Both of these changes are things I&#8217;ve complained about since day one with Gowalla, so they&#8217;re certainly welcome. But that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m excited for the app. I&#8217;m excited because it takes the idea of the check-in and extends it.Specifically, you can now add pictures and comments to check-ins in Gowalla. This makes for a much richer social experience both using the app and the website (the data goes over there as well). As founder and CEO Josh Williams describes in the video below, there were a lot of people who wanted to talk about the social activity on Gowalla, but previously they had to text message or email their friends to say something like &#8220;hey I saw you check-in at the restaurant, want some company?&#8221; Now, that type of dialogue can take place all within the app.Now, others have tried to add additional layers to check-ins in the past. Why I think it works with Gowalla 2.0 is because they keep it simple. The application is extremely handsome (since the beginning, everyone is quick to note how good the designers are working for the team) and intuitive. There are only a few basic things you can do, and all are obvious from the main screen. You can either check-in at a venue, comment on your friends&#8217; check-ins (with the new chat bubble in the stream), look at the spots around you, see trips (pre-planned venue excursions), or look at your own activity.Previously, with Gowalla, I thought the focus was too much on their virtual items. Those are now tucked away in your Passport (your profile). They&#8217;re still important, and will be increasingly so for Gowalla&#8217;s revenue model (trading virtual goods for real-world items), but they&#8217;re not in your face, confusing users.All that said, there are two downsides still to the service. First, the social activity stream includes everybody that your friends with. With Foursquare, the people currently in the same city as you are highlighted; Gowalla doesn&#8217;t do that. I suspect that will be very annoying to my friends not going to Austin this week for SXSW. Their stream will be a constant reminder that they&#8217;re not there â\\x80\\x94 and they likely could care less about my check-ins, since they can&#8217;t possibly come and meet me.The second downside is that Gowalla&#8217;s API remains read-only. That means while other services can pull out Gowalla&#8217;s data, they can&#8217;t put anything back in. That means there will be no Gowalla apps besides the ones they make (at least for now). Williams explained the rationale behind this as Gowalla wants to stay in control of the user experience (a rather Apple-like argument). That makes some sense, since there are all these virtual goods that will be flying around, and it will be hard to make sure every third-party app is implementing them correctly. Also, Gowalla is much more strict about its location-based check-ins then say, Foursquare. They&#8217;re so strict, in fact, that it&#8217;s been an issue in the past (and in some cases, still is), with people not being able to check-in places they&#8217;re actually at because the GPS is wonky. At the same time, this helps a lot with gaming the system, and that will be increasingly important as Gowalla strikes deals with partners based around check-ins.Listen to Williams talk more about the new app, as well as his thoughts on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network, some SXSW specials, rivals, and yes, even the news that Facebook is apparently looking at federating some of Gowalla&#8217;s (and Foursquare&#8217;s) data for its own location offering. He also notes that with the new release, Gowalla is expanding the idea of checking-in to be more of a bucket of elements now, including images and comments. Interesting. (Sorry in advance that I shot the video vertically on my iPhone â\\x80\\x94 gotta stop doing that.)You can find Gowalla 2.0 in the App Store here. It&#8217;s a free download.\\t\\t\\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t\\t\\trunMobileCompatibilityScript('myExperience71250026001');\\t CrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Newly independent Aol is still struggling with the fate of Bebo, the social network they acquired for $850 million in 2008. No one argues that Aol underpaid for Bebo. And the social network has fallen from 22 million monthly unique visitors when it was acquired to just 14.6 million today (Comscore worldwide). But even so, Bebo clearly has some value on the open market. Despite that value, Aol&#8217;s best financial option for Bebo will likely be to abandon it rather than sell it, say corporate tax experts we&#8217;ve spoken with.Here&#8217;s why &#8211; complicated corporate tax rules will let Aol write off the full purchase price of Bebo if they declare it worthless and abandon the asset. With Aol&#8217;s effective tax rate of around 45%, that&#8217;s $380 million and change in their pocket in taxes that they&#8217;d be able to avoid.A sale of Bebo would almost certainly be less attractive. If someone were to pay them $100 million for the service, which is optimistic, Aol could still offset the remaining $750 million as a tax loss. But it could only apply against long term capital gains, and Aol doesn&#8217;t have any to offset against. They&#8217;d have to carry that loss forward and hope for future gains to offset it against.One corporate tax attorney we spoke with wouldn&#8217;t discuss Aol specifically, but did confirm the logic of the approach. Bryan Smith, a partner at Perkins Coie, says &#8220;Without getting into any specific facts or companies, it will often be more attractive for a U.S. corporation to simply shut down a subsidiary and claim a deduction for the worthlessness of the stock against ordinary income instead of selling the stock at a distressed price and taking a capital loss, which may only offset capital gains.&#8221;If Aol were to abandon Bebo they couldn&#8217;t pull any of the assets of the company back into Aol, say the experts we&#8217;ve spoken with. Otherwise it becomes a non-taxable liquidation. If Aol had debt or preferred stock on the books with Bebo, though, they could pull out assets to offset that liability.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'With the iPad hitting pre-order in two days and shipping in April, it&#8217;s important to think about when and why to buy the iPad. Based on our understanding of the product lifecycle and expected moves by Apple&#8217;s competitors, we foresee big changes in the ultraportable landscape with the ultraportable/netbook as we now know it mutating &#8211; or branching &#8211; into a new species of media oriented Win7 and Android devices. Here&#8217;s what we can expect.April 3, 2010 &#8211; Big launch. Light crowds at the Apple Store. This isn&#8217;t huge-huge. It&#8217;s medium-huge and I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to see an army of the pasty arriving at your local shop clamoring for iPads. This is Apple&#8217;s wait and see product, although I don&#8217;t doubt between 3-5 million won&#8217;t wait and see in 2010.May-June 2010 &#8211; Chinese knock-offs will flood the market and we&#8217;ll see a nice collection of weird, mutated slates hitting the more esoteric sites. Nothing major and no big sellers.Summer 2010 &#8211; Dell and HP release their devices. Dell&#8217;s is called the Mini 5 AKA the Streak and HP&#8217;s as of yet unamed. These guys will wait until the waters have been fully tested before they move with their devices.Holidays 2010 &#8211; Expect an iPad bump. This could include more memory for cheaper or more features. The most obvious feature is a front-facing camera. Holiday and Back-to-School are Apple&#8217;s favorite time to upgrade but I don&#8217;t see them doing much in the way of upgrading before next Christmas. Don&#8217;t expect a fall in price at this time, just a change in specs.Summer 2011 &#8211; A whole new iPad and a potential contender from another corner, potentially Microsoft&#8217;s Courier product. By this time Apple will have either convinced the world they need and iPad or we&#8217;ll have another MacBook Air on our hands. While I&#8217;m leaning towards the former, the latter could still come to pass.Here&#8217;s another ball out of left field: what if Google came out with a slate running their own official version of Chrome OS. A GooglePad, then, would blow everyone&#8217;s minds and essentially make this a two-horse race. It&#8217;s a fascinating idea but I wouldn&#8217;t expect Google to move on this for at least a year.Back-to-School 2011 &#8211; Full iPad integration into the product line. The worst thing that the iPad could be at Apple is another Apple TV like outlier. By this time MacBooks will have changed, moving towards a more iPad UI model while netbooks will lose some ground to media slates that run Android and hang out on your coffee table.Carriers will also get in on the act with manufacturers like HTC upping the size of their devices to reflect a slate form factor. The trick is for Apple to normalize the slate form factor. Yes, slates have been around for years but people have never seen the value in a slate computer except in niche situations. What the iPad is is a slate &#8220;browser&#8221; or &#8220;net device,&#8221; something decidedly different than the monstrosities we&#8217;ve seen thus far. In general, once slate usage is normalized, I don&#8217;t think the mass of iPad/slate users will actually want to go back to netbooks. While I may be bullish, I think the iPad is carving a niche that will change entire landscape of low-cost computing this decade.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: In the following guest post, Fliqz CEO Benjamin Wayne reveals some of the secrets of using video to help boost the search results rankings of your website.  Fliqz is an online video platform.As most search engine optimization (SEO) experts are aware, getting a first-page Google result is harder than ever. Not only do Googleâ\\x80\\x99s search and indexing algorithms continue to evolve in complexity, but Google has given over more and more of its search results real estate to â\\x80\\x9cblendedâ\\x80\\x9d search results, displaying videos and images towards the top of the first page, and pushing downâ\\x80\\x94and sometimes off the pageâ\\x80\\x94traditional web results that would have otherwise competed for top rankings.But where problems arise, so do opportunities. Although Googleâ\\x80\\x99s newfound enthusiasm for video has created more competition for fewer traditional search results, it has enabled sites with video assetsâ\\x80\\x94even sites that would otherwise score poorly in the Google indexâ\\x80\\x94to successfully achieve first-page rankings. In fact, Forrester Research found that videos were 53 times more likely than traditional web pages to receive an organic first-page ranking.Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what a blended search result looks like for the search query &#8220;777 built in 4 minutes&#8220;:Those images at the top of the search results are video thumbnails, and today, thereâ\\x80\\x99s only two ways to get there:1. Upload your video to YouTube.The advantage of this is that you are 100% certain to be indexed into Googleâ\\x80\\x99s search engine. This does not guarantee youâ\\x80\\x99ll get a first-page result, but at least it ensures that Google knows your content exists.The drawback, of course, is that anyone who clicks on a YouTube result will be taken to YouTube, which may be fine if your goal is branding (i.e., you only care that people watch your video). If your goal is driving traffic, as is typically the case with SEO, this wonâ\\x80\\x99t be a successful strategy.Your other alternative is:2. Video SEOVideo SEO is a set of techniques designed to make sure that:Google finds your video contentGoogle successfully indexes your video contentGoogle will display your video content when specific keywords are entered as search termsHereâ\\x80\\x99s how to make it work:You Need Video ContentGoogle is fairly flexible in what it considers to be video content. You can use actual video footage, but screen captures, slide shows, animated PowerPoint slides, and other content will work just as well. Google canâ\\x80\\x99t actually â\\x80\\x9cseeâ\\x80\\x9d whatâ\\x80\\x99s inside the video content, so it relies on title and other meta-data to determine what content your video actually contains.Submission, Not DiscoveryWith traditional web pages, Google utilizes crawlers to discover and index web content. Unfortunately, Google canâ\\x80\\x99t read Flash very well (although it is trying), and as a result, most video content is invisible to Googleâ\\x80\\x99s search crawlers. Therefore, the best way to appear in Googleâ\\x80\\x99s blended search results is to submit your video to Google using a Video Sitemap. This is similar to an XML sitemap, but is formatted specifically for video, and only contains information about your video content. It is submitted using Googleâ\\x80\\x99s Webmaster Tools.The most common error in Video SEO is to assume that because you have submitted the web page on which a video resides, that the video content itself is being indexed.Youâ\\x80\\x99ll also need to make sure that you have a robots.txt file on all video pages, to ensure that Google can easily verify that the locations on the Web youâ\\x80\\x99ve submitted do in fact exist, and that they contain embed codes which indicate the presence of a video.Title and Title TagsWhen ranking videos, Google primarily considers the match between search keywords and the video title. Although Google allows you to submit other meta-data such as description and keywords, these currently donâ\\x80\\x99t have much influence on your search ranking. Google likes it when the title tag of the page matches the title of the video, and will give a higher weighting for results where this is the case.Video SEO is Long TailLike traditional SEO, youâ\\x80\\x99re much more likely to see results with Video SEO if you target more specific, or longer tail, search terms. A video titled â\\x80\\x9cDogâ\\x80\\x9d is unlikely to produce a first-page ranking, while a video titled â\\x80\\x9cGerman Shepherd Police Dogâ\\x80\\x9d will be more likely to score well in Googleâ\\x80\\x99s algorithm. Since Google canâ\\x80\\x99t determine the actual content of the video, you might consider submitting the same video multiple times with different titles that match potential search terms.New and Small Donâ\\x80\\x99t MatterWith traditional SEO, the age of a website is an important consideration for Google in deciding its ranking. Google also considers things like the number of pages on the site, and the number of links to the site, along with the importance of the places those links originate.In Video SEO, none of this matters. This means that even new sites and small sites can compete on equal footing with larger and more established players. Publishers who are too small or too new to even consider traditional SEO can still be taking advantage of Video SEO opportunities.For the Foreseeable Future, Video SEO is a Winning StrategyAs time goes by, Googleâ\\x80\\x99s discovery and indexing of video content will no doubt become more sophisticated, and as competition for video results increases, it will become harder for sites to achieve these first-page rankings. However, the number of web pages still massively outnumbers indexed video assets, and for as long as that continues, publishers will have an opportunity to jump to the top of Googleâ\\x80\\x99s search results through Video SEO.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Otherwise, read on.A site dedicated to Foursquare badges appropriately called Foursquarebadg.es has taken advantage of a technical glitch this morning to identify 15 special badges that will be available during this year&#8217;s SXSW conference, which starts this week in Austin, Texas.The criteria needed to unlock some of the badges are still unknown, but some of them are pretty easy to guess based on their titles. Hangover is apparently earned by checking in late at night and then early the following morning. RVIP Lounge (aka Karaoke RV) is earned by taking a ride on the infamous vehicle, which cruises around downtown Austin as its occupants belt out bad renditions of Journey. There&#8217;s  Panel Nerd, which the site guesses is earned by heading to the Convention Center before noon for three days during the conference.  And Early Adopter goes to the not-so-elite crowd that was checking in at SXSW using Foursquare last year, when the service was just getting started.  For the full list, check out the Foursquarebadg.es page.Personally, I stopped caring much about my Foursquare badges around 9 months ago (hence my previous post on why I think this model will grow old, and why Foursquare needs to innovate beyond just making new badges). That said, I&#8217;m sure the rampant use of Foursquare at SXSW by fellow techies will rekindle my competitive attitude for at least a few days. And for no apparent reason, I really want to get the still-mysterious special Â\\xa0Swimmies badge.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When Blippy launched a few months ago, the idea was to get the site up there as bare-bones as possible so it was simple to people. That makes sense since the idea of sharing your credit card transaction data was (and remains) highly controversial. But despite the controversy, users have embraced Blippy. So now it&#8217;s time to give it a fresh coat of paint â\\x80\\x94 and a new privacy feature.Today, Blippy has undergone a massive redesign. Previously, Blippy was a stream of your friends&#8217; transactions and little else. Now, it&#8217;s much more robust. In fact, it looks very similar to the most recent redesign of Facebook. You&#8217;ll notice the new update indicators next to the logo that get badged with a number when there is an update. You&#8217;ll also notice a search box front and center (for now, this is only to search for businesses or users).More important than the redesign is the new feature Blippy is launching. Starting today, you can manually review each purchase before it&#8217;s displayed on Blippy. This is an important step in the direction of better privacy controls. Previously, you could pick and choose which sources you imported your transaction data from, but it was an all-or-nothing proposition. You could remove items after they appeared in your stream, but not before. Now you can do that by approving each one. A bit of a pain? Sure, but for some who are really concerned about privacy, this is a welcome addition (of course, you may wonder why they&#8217;d be using Blippy in the first place, but hey, people are weird).This new setting will be displayed when users hook up their credit card or e-commerce account for the first time to Blippy.Blippy has already streamed about $15 million in purchases, co-founder Philip Kaplan notes. &#8220;Today, thousands of people are automatically sharing purchases on Blippy.  I think of it as &#8216;a stream of cool stuff my friends are buying.&#8217;  The additional level of control we&#8217;re introducing will make it even easier for people to share just want they want to share &#8212; whether a new iPhone app, movie from Netflix, favorite bar or restaurant, or grocery store run,&#8221; Kaplan says.In January, Blippy raised a $1.6 million round of funding. The company is also getting some traction with retailers â\\x80\\x94 though not all of them.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': \"2009 TechCrunch50 winner Redbeacon, a service that pairs consumers with service providers, is releasing a number of new features today, launching a distribution relationship and sharing key data from their beta trial. The 50,000 foot view is, this startup has legs.Users go to Redbeacon and search for real world service providers (housekeepers, plumbers, handyman, personal trainers, etc.). The service sends you firm quotes from local service providers, based on price and other factors, such as previous reviews and expertise with the specific job you want done. You can book an appointment online, and Redbeacon takes a 10% fee from the service provider.The service first went live in the San Francisco bay area in October, and now has thousands of local service providers. Most queries receive firm quotes within an hour, they say, and many get quotes within minutes. 100% of queries have received firm quotes, and &#8220;a very high percentage&#8221; of users are then booking appointments, says cofounder Ethan Anderson.But the beta period has given the company much needed feedback, too. Service provider profiles need to have a lot more information, they say, for users to feel comfortable booking with them (and perhaps bringing them into their home). So the company has greatly expanded profiles to give that information. Redbeacon has also created better tools to allow users and providers to communicate before, during and after a job.User can now upload more information on a job, such as a picture of the problem (a hole in the wall for a handyman, etc.). That leads to more and better quotes, says Anderson. We sat down with him at TechCrunch yesterday to talk about the company:\\t\\t\\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t  \\t\\t\\trunMobileCompatibilityScript('myExperience71090389001');\\tNew Features, New DealToday Redbeacon is adding a social feature to the product that allows users to ask friends about which quotes they should accept, or to recommend different providers. They&#8217;re doing this through Facebook Connect, and allowing users to post their questions directly onto Facebook. This has the added benefit of viral marketing, of course.Recent studies have shown that people love to ask their friends for advice when it comes to buying goods and services, and the success of services like Aardvark, which allow exactly that, aren&#8217;t surprising.Redbeacon is also adding organization memberships and badges for services providers (BBB, etc.). This gives extra assurance to users that the provider is legitimate.First Distribution DealRedbeacon is also announcing their first third party distribution deal, with Bigtent. These deals push the Redbeacon product directly into third party sites in exchange for a revenue share with the partner. Look for more of these over time, says Anderson.The Value In Redbeacon: Real ReviewsRedbeacon provides a valuable service that blows away things like the Yellow Pages. But there&#8217;s also a hidden gem &#8211; the service knows for sure when a transaction occurs, so a review by a user is going to be legitimate. All those problems with fake review on Yelp will be avoided on Redbeacon.Redbeacon pulls in review from Yelp, Google, etc. as well. But over time the review data they gather will be far more valuable than those services, simply because of verified transactions.What&#8217;s most amazing about Redbeacon is that the startup has held off on raising any outside capital at all until now, despite a feeding frenzy around the company (multiple venture capitalists and angel investors have begged us for introductions over the last few months). I&#8217;d imagine that fast will soon be over. Now&#8217;s the time to raise a good round of financing and push Redbeacon to multiple markets beyond the bay area.CrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday brought news that Facebook is planning to launch its location offering at its f8 conference in the end of April. In first reporting the news, the New York Times noted that &#8220;the company was not trying to beat the smaller location-based social networks, such as Loopt, Foursquare and Gowalla.&#8221; From what we&#8217;re hearing, that&#8217;s true â\\x80\\x94 because they could be using some of those services to federate check-ins.How do we know? Because it appears that a Facebook employee has been showing the app around to friends. One person who has seen it notes that the icon for the location feature has a pushpin on a map. This was apparently a beta version of an app, but the functionality, if Facebook chooses to go with it, would likely be built into the massively popular Facebook iPhone app.When reached for comment, all Facebook would say is, &#8220;We are constantly experimenting with new ideas and products internally.  We donâ\\x80\\x99t have anything more to share at this time.&#8221; That&#8217;s not exactly a denial at all.What Foursquare and Gowalla (the two location apps specifically cited by a source) had to say was more interesting. Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley danced around the idea of working with Facebook on such a feature, but notes that anyone can access their check-in data through Foursquare&#8217;s API. And in fact, plenty of users are already pushing their check-ins to Facebook through Connect, he notes. Also, this page is sort of interesting. It&#8217;s what we call a placeholder.Meanwhile, Gowalla founder Josh Williams said a bit more:It&#8217;s no surprise that Facebook is wading into the location waters (cannonball!) â\\x80\\x94 our ultimate goal at Gowalla is to provide the easiest and most fun way to share location with friends, regardless of where that information is distributed&#8230; Facebook, Twitter, etc. It will be important for folks like Facebook and Twitter to clearly spell out how this information is used and displayed.That suggests that both Facebook and Twitter have been looking at ways to import check-in data. Twitter already syndicates the data through its Geolocation API, but as more and more players get involved in the space, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising at all for the upstart players like Gowalla and Foursquare to ask the platforms (Facebook and Twitter) to make it more clear which data is being sent from where. And make no mistake, based on what we&#8217;re hearing, that&#8217;s exactly what Facebook aims to be with location: a platform. Yes, like their good buddies Twitter.[photo: flickr/24oranges.nl]CrunchBase Information',\n",

We&#8217;ve been hearing about the service for quite a while now (as well as its competitor, OTOY), but now OnLive finally has a solid release date: June 17, 2010.  At launch, the service will be available in the 48 contiguous states.The service will have a $14.95 per month base service fee, and then users will purchase games and rentals on an a la carte model on top of that.  You&#8217;ll be able to purchase multiple months at a time to get a discount on the service.  As a special for early users, OnLive is going to waive the service fee for three months for the first 25,000 users to pre-register at this page.OnLive&#8217;s demos are always impressive. Today, Perlman showcased the service&#8217;s ability to play recent games like Crysis on a large TV, as well as on his mobile phone (because all the processing is done in the cloud, even an iPhone can handle it).  He also showed off other features that OnLive will offer, like streaming movies and Xbox Live-like community features. It looks great, but OnLive still faces one very major hurdle: latency.  Because gamers aren&#8217;t actually playing their games on a local machine, there&#8217;s a slight lag whenever they do anything. And in the case of &#8216;twitchy&#8217; games like first person shooters, even 50 milliseconds of lag time can make the difference between a perfect kill and getting destroyed by your opponent.  It&#8217;s unclear how much lag will be present once OnLive is deployed on a wide scale.At launch OnLive will be available for PC and Mac only, and a MicroConsole TV adapter (which lets your TV hook up to the cloud service) will appear later this year.  1080p60 will be available in 2011 (Perlman says bandwidth available to consumers is what&#8217;s holding this back).  International announcements are coming later this year.Also be sure to check out our past coverage of OnLive competitor OTOY.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Weebly, the startup that allows users to build rich websites using a straightforward drag and drop interface, is about to get a lot more colorful.  The site has opened a new Theme Community, allowing any of its 3.5 million users to submit their own themes for use by other Weebly members.  To help launch the new feature, Weebly is holding a contest where it&#8217;s giving $10,000 to the top submitted design, as determined by a panel of professional designers.This is a pretty big deal for Weebly. Up until now, users have had around 80 themes to choose from, which pales in comparison to the number of themes available for some other site building platforms, like WordPress.  You&#8217;ve always been free to use your own custom CSS styling, but many of the site&#8217;s users are using Weebly specifically because they don&#8217;t want to have to dealÂ\\xa0with that sort of thing. Now they&#8217;ll have a lot more variety to choose from, with no mucking around in CSS required.At launch, Weebly&#8217;s theme gallery is still only going to consist of the 80 themes that already exist, since it&#8217;s just opening to submissions for the first time today.  But CEO David Rusenko expects that to change quickly, in part spurred by the design competition the site is holding.  He also believes that designers will be compelled to create themes for the site because of the large audience it reaches â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Weebly now has 3.5 million site building users, who see 80 million page views per month from 17 million unique visitors.  And he says that traffic is growing 20% month over month.  It&#8217;s a bit surprising that it took this long for the site to roll out the feature (Weebly launched back in 2007), but Rusenko says that they &#8220;wanted to get it right&#8221;. Fair enough.Users will be able to access the themes both through the site&#8217;s editor (which has been revamped a bit to accommodate the new gallery) and from this page, which you can view even if you aren&#8217;t a Weebly member.  Themes won&#8217;t include attribution in their footers, but the gallery itself will allow designers to build up their own profiles, allowing users to see all of the themes they&#8217;ve submitted. At launch, all themes will be free, but Rusenko says that the site plans to begin allowing designers to sell premium themes in the future.The design competition has a submission deadline of April 30, is open in any country where such contests are valid, and is being judged by Michael Cronan, Scott Thomas, Jason Putorti, Andrew Wilkinson, Dustin Curtis, and Rob Martin.

       "  'comments_content': 'Two years ago customer support startup Get Satisfaction turned its ear to Twitter to help its clients monitor Twitter for mentions of brands. Get Satisfaction makes a network of customer support forums where customers can post their own questions, ideas, problems, or conversations about a product. Companies can also claim their board and put their own employees on to moderate the boards. Tapping into the conversations taking place Twitter and other social media sites is now integral to brands and customer support, as we&#8217;ve recently seen with Southwest Airlines. Get Satisfaction is extending its social media coverage today by rolling out the ability to add a support tab to Facebook Fan pages. As companies turn to Facebook Fan Pages to connect with customers, consumers are increasingly voicing their issues with a particular product or brand on the brand&#8217;s Facebook page. But often these complaints or opinions can get lost in the stream. That&#8217;s where Get Satisfaction comes in. The startup now allows brands to create a tab on their fan pages, which can be a portal for consumers to express their opinions, complaints or issues with the brand or product.  With the Facebook Social Engagement Hub, Get Satisfaction creates a tab (that can be labeled with any brand-specific name) on the brand&#8217;s Fan Page. Here customers can begin wall discussions in the form of four topic types: Ask a Question, Share an Idea, Report a Problem, or Give Praise. When customers begin to post a question, Get Satisfaction searches for and suggests similar threads to give consumers instant answers to commonly asked questions. All questions, comments, and answers are discoverable via Google and other search engine. People can respond to any thread â\\x80\\x94 i.e. voice a similar problem, suggest a remedy, emerge as an advocate in response to another&#8217;s complaint, or offer a new twist to a product suggestion. Community members can also make their experience heard by simply clicking &#8216;me too&#8217;. In turn, any question, idea or problem posted on a brand&#8217;s hub on Facebook will be automatically imported into the brand&#8217;s Get Satisfaction web interface, allowing marketers and customer support reps to access the conversation from their Get Satisfaction site. Get Satisfaction&#8217;s co-founder Lane Becker says that the new offering is a part of helping brands distribute the conversations where the conversations are actually happening. And with 400 million users worldwide, Facebook is definitely a place where the conversations are taking place. Becker says that the startup is particularly focused on the idea of the &#8220;social CRM&#8221; and helping clients connect the conversations taking place regarding customers support on social media sites with CRM applications like Salesforce and Zendesk. Get Satisfaction currently has free app on Salesforce&#8217;s app exchange. The Facebook offering is a paid feature and Get Satisfaction will have a number of pricing options. Today&#8217;s rollout is more targeted towards bigger brands, but a more scaled down offering will be introduced soon and will cost SMBs $99 per month. Get Satisfaction recently raised $2.3 million in funding, which Becker says is being used to scale out its team. With only 20 employees, Get Satisfaction currently has 20,000 customers (10,000 of which are paid customers).  Zappos, Mint.com, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Nike have all created customer support communities on the site. Currently there are over 25,000 communities that have been created on the platform.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Facebook-based mobile app directory Mplayit is launching a new way to discover mobile apps today: App Gurus. The new feature draws recommendations from experts in the mobile space. The experts, which include blogs and technology writers, will rate and comment on apps in Mplayitâ\\x80\\x99s catalogs.Last year, Mplayit launched its Facebook app that allows users to discover, share and recommend a variety of mobile apps back in November and covers apps available for the iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Mobile (Java) devices. Mplayitâ\\x80\\x99s directory of apps includes a dedicated page for each app where Mplayit will post videos of the app (created either by the developer or pulled from YouTube), a detailed description of the app and reviews. You can also click to buy the app from various app markets, including Apple&#8217;s App Store and the Android Market.  Once you start clicking on various app and downloading apps, Mplayit will begin to recommend apps to you based on your behavior on the site.With the feature, consumers on Mplayit will be able to see a feed of real-time activity of the Gurus within the app. Guruâ\\x80\\x99s can also rank apps on a scale of one to five and apps rated by at least two Gurus with ratings or four or five stars get the top accolade, a â\\x80\\x9cGuru Approvedâ\\x80\\x9d badge. App Gurus include IntoMobile, iPhone Arcade, Androidandme  and Stuart Dredge. The feature is similar in some ways to competitor Appolicious&#8217; curated lists of recommended mobile apps. Mplayit also faces competition from AppsFire, 16Apps and others.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'You might want to take a different approach when shopping for a 3D TV than a standard HDTV. Instead of just looking at the picture quality, you should also take a serious look at the brand&#8217;s 3D glasses. Some show some clear advantages to purchase that brand&#8217;s 3D TV and until there&#8217;s a standard format for 3D glasses, each brand requires its own unique glasses, thereby locking you into that manufacturer&#8217;s products. Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit messy right now. Click through for details on all of them.Samsung There are three different models currently available. $150 gets you the SSG-2100AB with a user-replaceable battery, while the $200 set isÂ\\xa0rechargeable. (SSG-2200AR)Â\\xa0There is a rechargeable pair for children priced at $180. (SSG-2200KR) Samsung 3D TVs come bundled with two glasses and a 3D Blu-ray movie.SonySony hasn&#8217;t official announced its US 3D TV accessories, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say that the Japanese-market versions will be available here, too. The standard size TDG-BR100 gray model, along with the smaller blue and pink TDG-BR50 glasses will sell for 12,000 yen in Japan. That translates to $132 USD. The glasses also require the TMR-BR100 IRÂ\\xa0emitter, too. (5,000 yen, $55 USD) Only the LX900, which retails for 290,000 yen or $3,204 USD, comes with glasses &#8212; two, in fact.PanasonicThe Panasonic TY-EW3D10U glasses clearly win the &#8220;most radical&#8221; award. Each Panasonic 3D TV comes with a set and they retail for $149.99.Nvidia3D content can also be seen on computers with the right gear from Nvidia. The $199 Nvidia 3D Vision kit includes one pair of glasses, IR emitter, and connection cables. Additional glasses can be purchased for $149 each. Keep in mind, though, that a 3D-ready monitor/projector, GPU, and operating system like Vista or Win7 is also required.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: This guest post is written by Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of salesforce.com.  In it, he responds to critics of his last guest post arguing that enterprise software should be more like Facebook.Two weeks ago on TechCrunch I posted â\\x80\\x9cThe Facebook Imperative,â\\x80\\x9d which posed a simple question, â\\x80\\x9cWhy isnâ\\x80\\x99t all enterprise software like Facebook?â\\x80\\x9d  It was the next iteration of the question I asked in 1999 that spawned salesforce.com, â\\x80\\x9cWhy isnâ\\x80\\x99t all enterprise software like Amazon.com.â\\x80\\x9d  If you have read my book, Behind The Cloud, you are well aware how that one question launched a company, and a movement.  Its been an exciting decade.  But the real excitement is just starting.Frankly, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been amazed by the huge amount of responses, tweets, and comments (aka â\\x80\\x9cthe ruckus across the blogoshere,â\\x80\\x9d as Joe McKendrick calls it).  It only strengthens my conviction that we are about to see the greatest revolution in enterprise software, ever. Well, really, the most exciting revolution in computing, ever.  It will create more value for users, customers, and vendors by an order of magnitude over what we saw in the last wave.  And, itâ\\x80\\x99s really starting to happen right now. It is realtime.  It is social.  It is mobile.  And, it is about time.  Literally, it is about productivity.Iâ\\x80\\x99m energized by the excitement I see for a new generation of collaboration software in the enterprise to replace antiquated Microsoft Sharepoint servers and IBMâ\\x80\\x99s Lotus Notes. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve enjoyed seeing my observationâ\\x80\\x94that Lotus Notes was conceived before Mark Zuckerbergâ\\x80\\x94reverberate around the web. But, the reality is the Facebook Imperative contained more than a funny line. It hit a nerve.  We are all respondingâ\\x80\\x94debatingâ\\x80\\x94a question that is an imperative because we all need to take software to a new level, and now is the time.  Microsoft and IBM have maintained the status quo on enterprise collaboration software too long, and itâ\\x80\\x99s time for a change.There are an overwhelming number of you who agree that its time to transform the business conversation the same way Facebook has changed the consumer conversation. We are betting salesforce.com&#8217;s future on it.  Approximately 40% of companies are already deploying or planning to deploy a social computing platform, a number thatâ\\x80\\x99s expected to rise, says Irwin Lazar of Nemeretes Research.  Not everyone agrees, mostly the vendors that are milking their cash cows.  But, make no mistake about it, this generation of social platforms is very different than the last.Charles Zedlewski emerged from a long blogging hiatus to argue that Facebook is designed for entertainmentâ\\x80\\x94not productivity.  Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not surprising given that he works for SAP, one of the companies I have previously referred to as &#8220;innovationless&#8221;â\\x80\\x94in my view they remain the Anti-Cloud.  Their actions speak for themselves.  Still, Iâ\\x80\\x99m astounded that more enterprises havenâ\\x80\\x99t figured out how to tap into the real collaborative power of Facebook and Twitter, and the new social models that they have pioneered.  I consider Facebook and Twitterâ\\x80\\x94and the ability to tap into my network of friends and followersâ\\x80\\x94one the most productive ways I can start my day.  Using these new Internet phenoms, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tested new ad campaigns and elicited great customer responses, promoted my book to a large audience of people who cared, and with the help of my network, even named new productsâ\\x80\\x94all before I sat down for breakfast.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m not alone; ask Vinnie Mirchandani for a sneak preview of his new book and read how Starbucks, Avon, and Pepsi are using these new social services to increase productivity in their enterprises. Or, look at how Causes, one of Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s most popular apps, is having a fascinating impact on the future of philanthropy.While my admiration for Facebook is no secret, the fact is that the Facebook Imperativeâ\\x80\\x94much like The Amazon Imperative of 1999â\\x80\\x94is just a metaphor.  Like all metaphors, they are terrific catalysts to introduce an idea and orient people.  They are rooted in inspiration, but they do not funnel down to the granular details. And, there are details that make this movement entirely new in practice.  The power of this new model is to create the next level of productivity, collaboration, and learning in the enterprise.  And, I see it happening now in our own company.For years weâ\\x80\\x99ve been reading about the potential for institutional memory to transform a corporation into a learning organization. But, have we seen it happen beyond very few unique organizations? A true paradigm shift occurs when the barriers of entry are removed for everyone. That is changing fast.  With these new social models, there is a way to immediately leverage the knowledge of an organization. People with expertise and relevance are instantly looped in, can participate in the conversation, collaborate, and make contributions more simply than ever before.  That will be the catalyst of this new productivity revolutionâ\\x80\\x94delivered through these new social enterprise platforms.We have deployed Salesforce Chatter internally through our own beta program, and we are now using the social models proven by Facebook and Twitter to run our company. Our new social enterprise is built atop our existing business information and applications. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not partitioned off from other enterprise applications, but is an integrated part of itâ\\x80\\x94offering a new view of the data that is more productive and easier to use. Through enterprise sharing models, filtering and discovery tools, users have full flexibility over which people and data they followâ\\x80\\x94allowing them to fully maximize the value of their own feeds and eliminating the risk of â\\x80\\x9cpollutantsâ\\x80\\x9d some critics fear.I have learned more about my own company in the last three weeks using Salesforce Chatter than I have in the last three years.  It reminds me of the time we went live with http://ideas.salesforce.com.  The awareness I have today of what is happening with our employees, our customers, our products, our customer service escalations, and even the deals we are closing is spectacular. Social computing for the enterprise is about seeing what matters to your company, what is happening with your products, and among your people. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about the information you need to make decisions finding you.   I&#8217;m amazed at the potential of this technology.  There is just no way I can explain it to you in writing, so here is an actual screen shot that I took off my desktop to give you an idea of the flow (click to enlarge):It is time to let go of the past and start to create a compelling future for the software industry. Iâ\\x80\\x99m energized by the skeptics. Itâ\\x80\\x99s familiar. They all eventually convert to whatâ\\x80\\x99s important to customers, or become increasingly irrelevant.  You donâ\\x80\\x99t have to look any farther than last week when Steve Ballmer spoke to the University of Washington telling them Microsoft was finally â\\x80\\x9cAll-Inâ\\x80\\x9d the cloud.  Well, that only took a decade or two.  No more software plus services, now they are 100% cloud too. Sure.Iâ\\x80\\x99m living in the post-PC revolution.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m in a desktopless world that is about feeds and profiles running in all my browsers and mobile devices, and interacting in exciting new ways.  It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if I am in the office, at home, or at Starbucksâ\\x80\\x94I am productive wherever I am.  The enterprise is not just going to the cloud, itâ\\x80\\x99s now going social, and itâ\\x80\\x99s going mobile.  Facebook and Twitter have shown us the way.  Like Microsoft, and IBM, not everyone has to get it yet, but eventually they all will. As they say: Shift happens. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Brands are engaging in the conversations that are taking place on social media sites now more than ever. But in order to tap into the social conversations that are taking place on the web, brands and agencies need to have a powerful tool to track, measure and engage sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and others. One of the leaders in the social media tracking space, Radian6, is launching a new Engagement Console  to streamline this process. A desktop client built on Adobe AIR, the engagement console lets your both track and engage in the conversation taking place on blogs, videos, forums, boards, Twitter, Flickr, Google Buzz, LinkedIn, Facebook fan pages, public discussion groups, and mainstream news sites. The site also allows for assigning of tasks from within the platform, enabling users to access workflow from within the client. You can customize a tracking grid of social media sites by breaking out your conversation into stacks by broad or specific topics, tagged customer lists, or even user assignment. Stacks can also be separated out by media type. Th workflow feature allows you to tag, assign, and route posts to team members, and track the status of the assignments. Any conversations a user engages in, whether it be on Twitter, Facebook or with a co-worker, will be recorded for both the user and the administrator.  And of course, the console allows you to Tweet, reply, retweet, and send direct messages, shuffle through user profiles, and follow new contacts right from the platform. Similar to many of the consumer focused social media clients out there, Radian6 allows for unlimited accounts and includes a URL shortener. With respect to Facebook, the client allows users to respond to status updates, wall posts, comments, and â\\x80\\x9clikesâ\\x80\\x9d. Users can also view news feeds for Facebook friends, and see new photos or videos that have been uploaded from within the console. The dashboard also provides analytics from within the console, such as post volume, and engagement stats. Radian6 has had considerable success in terms of serving big-name clients. The company is currently helping over 10,000 brands track social media sites, including Comcast, MTV, Dell, UPS, GE and Microsoft. And this engagement console has all the bells and whistles to make any brand marketer content. The console, we are told, will be in private beta until April. That being said, there are plenty of other offerings for companies and agencies to track social media and this is a competitive space. Radian6 faces competition from a number of startups including Scout Labs, Visible Measures, Viralheat, HootSuite and PeopleBrowsr. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say this about Brazilian startupsâ\\x80\\x94theyâ\\x80\\x99re certainly not dominated by Web copycats. Perhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s because there arenâ\\x80\\x99t a huge number of Brazilians whoâ\\x80\\x99ve made it big in the Valley transmuting the local way of doing things back home or because thereâ\\x80\\x99s not a lot of US venture capital flooding into the country. Perhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s the countryâ\\x80\\x99s noted isolationist streak, or perhaps it was just the startups I lucked into meeting.But whatever the reason I saw fewer â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re-the-fill-in-the-blank-Web-company-of-Brazilâ\\x80\\x9d ventures than I have in any other market to which Iâ\\x80\\x99ve traveled in the last few years. Many Brazilians I spoke with said itâ\\x80\\x99s just part of their nature, that theyâ\\x80\\x99re not competitive (tell that to fans of opposing soccer teams), and that theyâ\\x80\\x99d rather chase â\\x80\\x9cgreen fieldâ\\x80\\x9d &#8211; or, as they say, &#8220;blue ocean&#8221; &#8211; opportunities. See, they donâ\\x80\\x99t even use the same color to describe opportunities.No matter the reason, after nearly 30 weeks of emerging market travel it was refreshing to go to a country and see things that are unequivocally new, even if risky and a bit, well, wacky. To make the point, here are three of my favorites: Companies that make bugs, houses and diamonds.The Worldâ\\x80\\x99s Ickiest Factory: Bug is one of most aptly-named companies in the world. This company makes bugs. No really, I saw the factory: Millions of eggs, and jars and jars of larvae and cocoons. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a â\\x80\\x9ccookâ\\x80\\x9d on staff who makes up the peanut-buttery solution these bugs feed on and each room is kept at an optimal temperature for that stage of bug development. Like something out of a sci-fi movie, the company is growing natural predators for common agricultural pests, so that farmers can move away from pesticides in accordance with a growing wave of worldwide safety regulations and the organic food movement. Itâ\\x80\\x99s combating a caterpillar with a waspâ\\x80\\x94like nature intended&#8211; but rather than selling live wasps, it sells wasp-infected caterpillar eggs and cocoons. Think of them like thousands of little Trojan horses being dropped into Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s sugar cane, tomato, and soybean fields.Brazil is the second largest agricultural country in terms of exports and the largest pesticide user in the world, recently overtaking the United States. The company is only doing a few million in revenues but is hugely profitable. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the good thing about growing something found in natureâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty cheap once you figure out the optimal way to do it.But even without all that, I would love this story because Heraldo Negri, one of the co-founders, is just obsessed with bugs. Since he was 19-years-old heâ\\x80\\x99s photographed pictures of bugs in every stage of life. He has albums and albums of them and even started a niche publishing house to produce his bug books for the masses. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to think this is weird at all. When he handed me a stack of his books on bugs he exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cYour husband will love these!â\\x80\\x9d (Note: My husband has a horrible fear of spiders.) Thatâ\\x80\\x99s Negri above, standing on the left. What you canâ\\x80\\x99t see from the picture is that heâ\\x80\\x99s holding two fistfuls of larvae. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a close-up&#8230;.Negriâ\\x80\\x94a former college professor who lives several hours outside of Sao Pauloâ\\x80\\x94 always wanted to be an entrepreneur but says he never quite had the guts to take the plunge. But the sheer obsession with the idea and technology drove him to take a sabbatical (which he intends to be permanent) from his university teaching job to run this company full-time.Bug is funded by Fundo Criatec, a government-sponsored venture fund. Itâ\\x80\\x99s one of its hottest companies and Francisco Jardim (standing to the right in the main photo), whoâ\\x80\\x99s in charge of the fundâ\\x80\\x99s deals throughout the state of Sao Paulo, drives out to Piracicaba meet with them several times a month.Bug was a risky investment deal in a country that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t take a ton of venture risk. The technology was there, but several VCs walked from negotiations because the company didnâ\\x80\\x99t yet have local certification to sell to farmers. Now, it is one of the only ones that does, and its biggest problem is meeting demand, so itâ\\x80\\x99s investing in better, larger bug-growing facilities. (Right now theyâ\\x80\\x99re largely using a series of houses and an old supermarket.) Certification is a process that takes several years, and tellingly, some big multinationals and other upstarts recently applied for certification, Jardim says.How to Build a House in One Day: It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t take much travel to see that millions of people in the emerging world need better housingâ\\x80\\x94hell, you could just watch â\\x80\\x9cCity of God,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSlumdog Millionaire,â\\x80\\x9d or earthquake footage from Haiti. Or just visit 16th and Mission in San Francisco. Much of the emerging world is living in makeshift structures that are missing walls, doors or decent ceilings. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what makes BS Construtora so potentially exciting not only for Brazil but the entire emerging world.BS Construtora was started 14 years ago and for many years was just a small business known in agriculture sectors for its ability to build structures such as silos faster than the competition. 2006 was a bad year for agriculture in Brazil, and the company had to look around for other customers. The founder Sidnei Borges dos Santos, a former brick layer, was looking at a shoebox when he had the idea for how to build a prefab house quicker than the competition. Rather than pre-make parts and assemble them wall-by-wall and beam-by-bean, what if he made a mold that could lay the concrete for the whole room in one big piece, add the shutters, paint it and throw it on a truck? The molds leave room for plumbing and lighting and plop the houses on the ground just like the inspiration&#8211;an upside-down shoebox.Today the company can build a house in 24 hours. It&#8217;s currently building a whole city complete with 1,600 houses, electricity, phone lines, Internet access, schools, a hospital, a police station, a fire station and a shopping mall in the Amazon for a crew building a hydroelectric dam. The photo of the village I saw looked eerily like where â\\x80\\x9cThe Othersâ\\x80\\x9d live in Lost, but a house built on the cheap in 24 hours isnâ\\x80\\x99t for showâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s for necessity and speed. And thereâ\\x80\\x99s a ton of need in the world for this product. The company is meeting with governments of South Africa, Ghana, other parts of Latin America and Asia to talk about expansion.The problem is thin margins. So far BS Construtora has been financing itself mostly through working capital while trying to dramatically increase capacity. It can build 20,000 houses in a year and CEO Marcelo Miranda wants that up to 30,000. In another year, the company will start looking at raising some funding to help grow faster, he says. For now, he wants to give the valuation some time to build, given all the growth the company is seeing. The houses go for between $15,000 and $140,000, for nicer-non-Lost-like models. The company is also developing some new four-story models to get farther into the commercial market.BS Construtora gets a few big corporate or government funded projects like the village described aboveâ\\x80\\x94a $120 million-plus projectâ\\x80\\x94but the bulk are developed and sold on the real estate market. The former is likely lower margin but less volatile, and the latter is the opposite. Between the two, though, the company generated an impressive $100 million in revenues last year &#8211; made all the more impressive by the fact that this is a startup that hasn&#8217;t received any external funding, operating in an emerging market.In a decline-of-America-side-note, Miranda recently completed Stanford&#8217;s Sloan Program for management which is like a mini-one-year MBA. He got 13 other job offers upon graduation, including some impressive ones to head up multi-national divisions in Brazil. (He asked me not to disclose specifics.) He gutsily chose to take this rather uncertain post at BS Construtora last yearâ\\x80\\x94at nearly half the pay he was offered elsewhere&#8211; despite the fact it was mostly an idea with little execution.Whyâ\\x80\\x99d Miranda go back to Brazil? Part of it was a desire to build something in his homeland. Part of it was when he interviewed at companies in the US they intimated that there was pressure to hire only Americans. â\\x80\\x9cIt was the wrong time to be there,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cThe feelings were not good for a foreigner like me.â\\x80\\x9d Looks like that brain drain isnâ\\x80\\x99t limited to India and China.Drilling Your Teeth the P-Diddy Way: Another Fundo Criatec investment is CVD. (I know, itâ\\x80\\x99s not nearly as well named as Bug.) This company makes man-made, multi-crystal diamonds, with technology spun-off from the Brazilian equivalent of NASA, INPE. Aeronautics was big during the dictator days and there was a need for super-hard materials that were durable and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t corrode, so it started experimenting with growing diamonds and using them in space. Much like the early days of NASA gave American things like the EKG and Tang, Vladimir Airoldi (left) is working to make this diamond technology applicable to everyday life.The key to CVDâ\\x80\\x99s edge isnâ\\x80\\x99t so much the diamond itself, itâ\\x80\\x99s the way it preps the diamond to be adhered to another surface. The first product is tips of dentist drills. Diamond powder is already used on drills, but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t stay on well. Because CVDâ\\x80\\x99s adhesives are so much stronger it can drill with an ultra-sonic, not rotational motion, which means no pain, no bleeding and no anesthetic, the company says. Early adoption has been a challenge. Dentists are trained a certain way and donâ\\x80\\x99t like to deviate. So far just 5,000 dentists in Brazil have tried it and 3,000 are still using it. Another early use is drilling into the earth. CVD did a pilot-sale of some diamond-adhered drill tips to Petrobras a few months ago.The hope is to turn CVD into a platform company that can spin out lots of these ideas, and partner with others to take them to market. Obviously, the challenge here will be the latter. The technology is there, and Airoldi, a CalPoly grad who got his ideas about tech transfer from his experience in California, can come up with dozens of use cases off the top of his head. Focus is going to be a key for this company.But, like Bug and BS Construtora, CVD is trying to introduce new technology into industries that many other entrepreneurs have forgotten about. If thatâ\\x80\\x99s going to be the new green field â\\x80\\x93 or blue oceanâ\\x80\\x94opportunity, Brazil is a good place to bet.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Live video streaming on the web is becoming more and more popular, and for news organizations and brands who don&#8217;t want to shell out thousands of dollars a day for a satellite truck there is another option.  At SXSW, Kyte is going to release a new product called Kyte LivePro Unwired with Spin magazine.  LivePro is a computer in a backpack connected to six data cards all uploading live video at the same time, balancing the load  across three different carriers (Sprint, AT&amp;T, and Verizon).  It is made by LiveU and Kyte will be reselling it to its larger customers.  (LiveStream uses the same technology in its Livepack).  Kyte CEO Daniel Graf came by my office the other day to show me the technology (see video below).  It is incredible that a backpack can now replace a satellite truck.  You won&#8217;t get HD quality, but you can get broadcast-TV quality, and it is certainly better than uploading video from your mobile phone, which Kyte also allows.  He says that typical livestreaming rates with the backpack are 700 kilobits to 1 megabit per second.Some customers using Kyte&#8217;s online video platform include Fox News, MTV, and Calvin Klein.  Graf says Kyte is now streaming 100 million videos a month across its network, up from 50 million last summer.CrunchBase Information',\n",

And today their passion got a little boost: from Google.Google is announcing tomorrow at the National Bike Summit in Washington, DC that Google Maps will now include biking directions in the U.S. Apparently, this was the most-requested feature for the service, as some 57 million Americans ride bikes.Thousands of miles of bike trails have been added to the maps. And there is also step-by-step directions, much like you can see for driving or public transportation directions in the maps. There is also a new layer that shows bike trails and bike-friendly areas on roads. Yes, it&#8217;s a bike-lover&#8217;s dream.To make this new feature happen, Google partnered with Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, a nonprofit group that converts old rail lines into bike trails. The group have given Google information on some 12,000 miles worth of trails in the U.S.To coincide with the launch, Google also has a cycling contest.Â\\xa0To enter, you simply have to tweet with the hashtag #bikewithgoogle. The randomly selected winner will get a voucher for $2,500 to be used atÂ\\xa0American Cyclery.I fully expect that hashtag to be dominated by members of Yahoo&#8217;s cycling team tomorrow.Find out more about the new feature in the video below.

       "  'comments_content': 'A new study by Comscore will be released on Wednesday that may give hope to social gaming startups trying to monetize users. 35% of the survey respondents said that they engage in &#8220;marketing actions&#8221; to earn virtual currency (such as watching a video, filling out a survey, etc.), and 53% said they be willing to consider marketing action for currency if given the choice.The study was conducted by Comscore, sponsored by Offerpal, and included responses from 799 Comscore panelists who play games on social networks at least once per month. 54% of panelists play games at least daily.This is good news for game developers who&#8217;ve had their monetization choices somewhat fenced in over the last few months.  Gamers 25-34 are the most likely to earn virtual currency for marketing actions, according to the study &#8211; 71% of panelists in that age group said they are &#8220;very likely&#8221; to consider this.The study also showed that about 30% of panelists don&#8217;t have the ability to pay cash for virtual currency. But more than half of all panelists, including a majority of those that can pay cash and a majority of those that cannot pay cash, were willing to consider marketing actions.The bottom line of the study is that even users who have the ability to pull out their wallet want options when it comes to social games. And as long as they don&#8217;t get scammed along the way, we&#8217;re just fine with it. Watch a video in exchange for Zynga points? That&#8217;s a better deal than the credit card.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'With SXSW starting Friday in Austin, Texas, every location-based service out there is right now finalizing updates that they hope will be the one that gets them used more than all the others. Loopt, is betting on events integration.The latest version of the app, due to hit the App Store tomorrow will feature a new Pulse tab. Here you&#8217;ll find events populated from a ton of sources including the live music tracker SonicLiving (SXSW is first and foremost a music event, after all) and most notably, Facebook. This pre-population is important, because it means the events will already be in the system so users won&#8217;t have to do anything other than share it with friends, or check-in if they&#8217;re going.Â\\xa0The feature also uses you current location to show which events are happening around you at any given moment that a lot of people are at.As you might expect, you also also tell who is already at the event, and which of your friend is supposed to be going. The later feature works with Facebook Connect. You can RSVP to an event right from within Loopt and see who else is scheduled to go.Calling it the &#8220;best event ever from an app,&#8221; Loopt founder Sam Altman believes they&#8217;ll have every single event taking place at SXSW in their system. A newer startup, the recently fundedÂ\\xa0Plancast (started by TechCrunch alum Mark Hendrickson),Â\\xa0may have something to say about that statement as they&#8217;ll be debuting their own events-based iPhone app at the festival as well. And like this new Loopt feature, a key Plancast component is Facebook event integration.Gowalla, meanwhile, has a full list of events straight from SXSW itself â\\x80\\x94 which is highlighting the app on it&#8217;s main site. Gowalla is Austin-based.Loopt was one of the original hot players in the location space, launching an iPhone app alongside the App Store launch in 2008. However, their initial bet was on always-on location updates, which the iPhone cannot do because it will not allow third-party apps to run in the background. Loopt found a loophole (see what I did there?) to that through AT&amp;T, but by then the momentum has already swung to the check-in based location services like Foursquare and Gowalla. Last year, Loopt pivoted its app to be more predicated around check-ins.Look for the latest Loopt app tomorrow in the App Store.Disclosure: Loopt offers a TechCrunch branded version of the serviceÂ\\xa0here.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Business to business software can be a tough sell. Online B2B can be even a harder sell. While there is certainly money to be made, unless you&#8217;re one of the big players, the likelihood you&#8217;re going to succeed is pretty small. Starting today, Google is taking their roll as one of the big players and extending a platform to boost some smaller players.Tonight, Google has unveiled their Google Apps Marketplace. This is an app store for enterprise apps in the cloud. Using a set of APIs, these third-party apps can deeply integrate their products within Google Apps, which already some 25 million people are using. And that also includes over 2 million businesses ranging from startups, to small businesses, to Fortune 500 companies.For customers, this means a one-stop shop for a variety of applications that their business or organization can use. And it&#8217;s extremely simple to get started with apps in the marketplace â\\x80\\x94 it just takes 4 clicks, Google says (though that initial click will have to come from your domain admin to approve the use of the app). For developers, particularly small startup developers, it means instant access to more users than they can likely imagine. It also potentially means something more important: money.Like the popular mobile app stores (Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google&#8217;s own Android Market), Google is allowing developers to sell their apps through this Marketplace. And they&#8217;re actually offering a better deal: Google will keep just 20% of the revenue, while the developers keep the other 80% (compared to a 30/70 split with the Android Market). The reason for this better split is that Google believes the B2B market is a bit different, and they want to entice developers to join on board. And instead of Apple&#8217;s App Store, which charges a $100 yearly fee to developers, Google is charging a one-time fee of $100 to enroll in the program â\\x80\\x94 and that&#8217;s for as many apps as you want to create.As for what Google will do with their 20% share, they&#8217;re not entirely sure. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what will happen with the revenue, but we think it&#8217;s a very fair rev share for the value we&#8217;re providing,&#8221; Google Vice President of Engineering Vic Gundotra says.As you might expect, in the Marketplace, Google will feature certain apps on a rotating basis. And each will have a star rating system and reviews written by people who have used the app. Apps will be grouped into different categories to make it easier for customers to find exactly what they&#8217;re looking for. Once they do, the four steps alluded to above are:Click &#8220;Add it now&#8221;Agree to the vendor&#8217;s Terms of ServiceGrant access to the data that the app is requesting.Â\\xa0 Some apps require data access, some don&#8217;t &#8211; only grant access to apps you trust.Turn it on and start enjoying your increased productivitySo how does this all work? Google connection points for integration into Apps are actually done through open protocols such as OAuth. And while signing-in may seem like a pain across different apps, Google has streamlined that as well thanks to another open protocol: OpenID.Once an app is hooked in to Google Apps, it will appear on your main Apps Dashboard alongside the other Google-made apps you use. It will even appear in the &#8220;more&#8221; drop down that Google uses in the toolbar across its properties. And because these apps are so tightly woven into Google Apps, they can take advantage of the built-in Google Apps such as Gmail and Gtalk to easily communicate within the third-party apps.And there&#8217;s more. While it&#8217;s not quite ready to launch just yet, in the second half of 2010, Google plans to launch flexible billing options for third-parties using their services. Basically, this will allow companies to use Google Checkout to handle complicated billings, such as subscriptions. This could mean trouble for startups specifically in this space, such as Recurly. Also coming later will be detailed analytics for transactions, we&#8217;re told. For now, developers are free to hook up their data to their own analytic programs to run their numbers.While Google&#8217;s options for this Marketplace sound nice and open, there&#8217;s actually something even better: you don&#8217;t have to build your apps on their platform. Whereas a big player like Salesforce wants to keep the apps it works with in the Force.com ecosystem, Google doesn&#8217;t care where you build it â\\x80\\x94 it can be on App Engine, or on anything else. You simply hook your app up to the APIs and you&#8217;re ready to go. It&#8217;s a model so enticing that even a big Google competitor in this space, Zoho, is ready to work with them, and isÂ\\xa0launching as an initial partner. All told, there are more than 50 companies partnering up at launch, including a winner of the audience award at this year&#8217;s TechCrunch50, Socialwok.As to whether Google could eventually roll this app store model out to the more consumer facing apps they offer, Gundotra gave me the old, &#8220;We haveÂ\\xa0nothing to announce at this time.&#8221; That reads suspiciously to me like a &#8220;yes,&#8221; provided this is the hit it seems like it should be.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Zoho, a web-based productivity suite that was called a &#8220;fake Office&#8221; by a Microsoft VP, is announcing a significant partnership with Google today. The startup will be a launch partner for Google&#8217;s recently launched Google Apps Marketplace, which allows vendors to sell applications that compliment Google Apps. Here are our notes from the announcement. Zoho will be integrating two of its over 20  business applications &#8211; Zoho CRM and Zoho Projects with Google Apps.So starting today, Google Apps users will be able to add on-demand CRM app Zoho CRM and project management software Zoho Projects into Google Apps. While Zoho has previously rolled out the ability log-in to its applications via your Google Apps IDs, the two applications have been specially formatted for further immersion into Google Apps with App&#8217;s extended APIs. IT admins will now have an option to add Zoho Apps to their domains through Google Apps Marketplace. Once the IT admin adds a Zoho application to their domain, all users within the domain will have access to the Zoho Application through Google universal navigation. In the version of Zoho CRM for Google Apps, Zoho will allow Google Apps domain admins choose the users he or she  wants to provide access to Zoho CRM and can  import users from Google Apps contacts. And if you have Mail Add-on enabled in Zoho CRM, you can POP your email from Google Apps to Zoho CRM. These emails will show up in the CRM system automatically for each contact. Emails sent from Zoho CRM will also show up in Gmail in Google Apps. Zoho CRM and Projects will also be integrated with Google Apps Calendar. Google Apps users will now be able to subscribe and view their CRM and Projects events right within Google Calendar. Additionally, Zoho Projects and Zoho CRM allows you to attach documents directly from Google Apps. The fact that Zoho was chosen as a pilot partner for this program isn&#8217;t surprising. Although some of Zoho&#8217;s applications compete with Google apps products, the startup has consistently pushed interoperability with Google Apps. Over the past two years, the startup launched a deeper integration with Google Docs;  and the ability to log-in with Google and Yahoo IDs.  And according to our latest stats, Zoho has definitely reached over 2 million users, and has a loyal follower base. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Tonight, Google launched its Google Apps Marketplace, an online storefront for Apps products and services. Here are our notes from the announcement. And of course, the marketplace is launching with a number of pilot partners (50 to be exact). One of those partners happens to be recently launched Socialwok, a product that ads a social layer to Gmail and other Google products. At last year&#8217;s TechCrunch50 conference, Socialwok made a big splash, winning the award for best demopit startup and launching its enterprise-friendly, FriendFeed-like layer for Google Apps. The web-based application was praised for launching a social network that wrapped around the very unsocial Google Apps. And the startup just launched a gadget to allow users access all the features of Socialwok without leaving Gmail. Socialwok in the the Google Apps Marketplace allows organizations to use their existing Google Apps accounts to login into Socialwok and create a social network for their domains to share within Google Docs, Google Calendars, Google Spreadsheets and other Google objects in feeds. For example, with the Socialwok Gmail gadget, users can view, post and comment on various feeds in their organization right from Gmail.Ming Yong, CEO of the company, said that integration with the marketplace was a logical choice because of the growing number of SMBs that are using Google Apps as their productivity suite of choice. Currently Google has more than 2 million businesses using the Google Apps Suite. Over 6,000 domains and tens of thousands of users are using Socialwok. Socialwok&#8217;s standard edition on the marketplace will be free but the startup will launch a paid edition in May.Socialwok, which employs a freemium model, has steadily been adding features and improvements to its application, including releasing a new version of its HTML 5 mobile version for Android and iPhone browsers. And in the process of developing an innocative application, startup managed to catch Google&#8217;s eye. Socialwok was  chosen as one of the showcase companies for AppEngine technology at this year&#8217;s Google IO Developer Sandbox (Socialwok is powered by Google App Engine). And the startup wrote a blog post on Google&#8217;s Enterprise Blog about Socialwok. We&#8217;ve continuously written that if Google doesnâ\\x80\\x99t buy the startup, they should at least heavily promoting what theyâ\\x80\\x99re doing. And it appears that Google has taken the latter route. For now. There&#8217;s no doubt that Socialwok could face the same fate as Google Docs killer and collaboration platform Etherpad or Microsoft Word collaboration plug-in Docverse.\\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

To make matters worse, Wilkinson says that MetaLab actually bid on creating the design for FlightDeck months ago, but was turned down by Mozilla.While Wilkinson is understandably upset, at this point,it looks like the plagiarized image is just a mockup on the Mozilla wiki â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0not the actual product (though it&#8217;s obviously still in bad taste).

You can see a screenshot comparison from Wilkinson&#8217;s blog post below.Update: Here&#8217;s a comment from Mozilla, stating that the copy-and-paste design was a proof of concept:Mozilla is now aware of a post by MetaLab that shows a Mozilla developer copying prior design work. The mockups they cite were an early proof of concept created by cut-and-paste, never final designs. Mozilla respects the hard work of all designers and at no time meant to plagiarize original content. The in-progress designs for the Jetpack SDKâ\\x80\\x99s IDE are available here and following initial sign-off on the proof of concept, the IDE was developed entirely independent of MetaLabsâ\\x80\\x99 work.On its wiki, Mozilla describes FlightDeck as a tool to &#8220;enable the community to rapidly, collaboratively develop both extensions that utilize the Jetpack framework and Jetpack Capabilities crucial to the expansion of the Jetpack framework&#8217;s core.&#8220;Update 2: Wilkinson has added the following update to his blog post:I just got off the phone with the team at Mozilla, who apologized and clarified a few things. The design which used our siteâ\\x80\\x99s design elements was a development build and according to them the design has been changed in newer builds. That said, it was used in their launch video as well as their blog post announcing the product. They told me that that the team who put together the blog post and video was unaware of the similarities at the time of inclusion.

And a low 20% rev share.Over 50 launch partners.David Glazer, Engineering DirectorI want to walk you through the &#8220;how&#8221; now &#8211; build, integrate, and sell.Google Apps now has a large and growing number of extension points (we&#8217;ll be adding more over time)there is a central management systemUniversal integration to Google Apps navigation system.We use OpenID to manage authentication. Single sign-on.And we use OAuth for secure access to data. The OAuth grant of trust is built into the Marketplace.We have a complete manifest.Time for a demo. Here&#8217;s a developer showing off a &#8220;hello world&#8221; application.Easy step-by-step process to get your application in the Marketplace.It might take a couple of days for the app to show up in the Marketplace when you submit it.A domain admin simply then clicks the &#8220;Add it now&#8221; button.Then just three clicks left &#8211; 1) agree to terms of service 2) grant data access (such as to your calendar) 3) enable the appYou can even see it in the apps drop down if you&#8217;re in, say, Gmail.Here&#8217;s Intuit now showing how to take a real app &#8211; for payroll &#8211; to show how easy it is to itegrate.Intuit is the largest payroll provider in the nation.We usually serve small companies, many are less than 20 employees.Another demo, this time from Atlassian &#8211; a software development companyYou can easily embed your information inside of Gmail.The thing I&#8217;m most excited about is the studio activity bar.With this, Google Talk can be used for instant collaboration.All of this is available today. In fact it&#8217;s being used by 40 developers in a bus traveling from SF to SXSW in Austin, TX.Another demo, Manymoon &#8211; a social productivity app.We used open standards to convert free users to paid users.Everything you&#8217;ve seen so far will be live later tonight &#8211; for this next demo, it will be coming soon.Gmail contextual gadgets &#8211; like when a YouTube video is embedded in Gmails &#8211; soon third-parties will be able to use this.Here&#8217;s a demo from Appirio &#8211; a cloud solution provider.Glazer is now reiterating the main points about the Marketplace.David Garrard from GoogleWhen I joined not only was there no Google Apps, there were no apps. Gmail launched soon after I joined.I joined to lead our enterprise initiative. It was the idea to take the innovation that happens quickly on the consumer side and putting it into the enterprise apps.Cloud computing is the right formula for thatThree years ago we started with a modest effort. In Feb 2007 we immediately signed up 9,000 business &#8212; now we have 25 million active users and 2 million business.And the growth rate is accelerating.Higher education has really started moving towards the cloud with us.And it&#8217;s happening in the Fortune 500 companies. And no companies that size have gone back.Though it&#8217;s still not perfect, even today.People always ask, &#8216;when are going to build x or y&#8217; the answer is we probably won&#8217;t &#8211; we want to be a platform in the cloud.Because of that we can put emphasis on our existing apps.We&#8217;ll be talking more at Google I/O (which is already sold out).And that&#8217;s a wrap.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the last few days, a strange situation has been brewing between Amazon and a sizable number of comic book fans.  On March 7, Bleeding Cool broke the news of an apparent Amazon sale featuring high quality hardcover Marvel graphic novels at bargain-basement prices of $14.99, when their retail prices were more along the lines of $125.  Alas, it turned out to be a pricing error.  Amazon could have simply canceled the orders (which is common practice for online retailers), but instead, it tried to do right by its users and said it would honor some of the orders.  Except it didn&#8217;t actually have enough books in stock to do what it promised, leading to another wave of frustration from the comics fans.  Now Amazon is looking to smooth things over with some $25 dollar gift certificates.The tale is a bit complicated. After word of the apparent sale began to spread,  plenty of comics fans began to snatch up the books as quickly as they could, causing some of the graphic novels to climb toward the top of Amazon&#8217;s best seller lists.  Within hours Amazon fixed the pricing glitches (which affected multiple items), and told some customers that rather than canceling their entire orders, they&#8217;d still receive a single copy of the books they purchased at the heavily discounted price. The only catch was that they&#8217;d only get one copy apiece (many people had purchased multiple copies).  Quite a nice gesture considering that Amazon could have simply canceled the orders outright.Unfortunately, something went wrong. This morning, Bleeding Cool reported that many (and perhaps all) of these single-copy orders had been canceled as well, without any kind of notice or email from Amazon. As it turns out, Amazon simply doesn&#8217;t have enough books in inventory to fulfill all the orders it promised, so it&#8217;s handing out $25 gift certificates as an apology for the inconvenience.Not everyone who bought a Marvel book is getting a certificate â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0if you placed an order that was immediately canceled, then it sounds like you won&#8217;t get one.  Some people should be actually getting their books in the mail. If you got an email saying your order was cancelled, you should be hearing from Amazon about this shortly.It&#8217;s hard to really fault Amazon for this. Obviously there were some errors in miscommunication, but it really didn&#8217;t have to do any of this â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0every online retailer has a clause in their Terms of Service that doesn&#8217;t make them liable for pricing mistakes.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Later this week, thousands of ironic t-shirts will be arriving in Austin for the 16th annual South By Southwest Interactive festival.At about this time, it&#8217;s traditional for tech publications to publish handy guides to &#8220;surviving SXSWi&#8221; &#8211; packed with useful advice that&#8217;s basically interchangeable with that for any other festival since the beginning of time.&#8220;Drink plenty of water!&#8221; &#8220;Prepare for some late nights!&#8221; &#8220;Plan ahead to make sure you don&#8217;t miss anything!&#8221; &#8220;Pack sturdy shoes!&#8221; &#8220;Always use a condom!&#8221;. Useful advice for SXSWi, certainly, but also applicable for Oktoberfest, Glastonbury, Woodstock and the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia (although for the latter, replace &#8217;shoes&#8217; with &#8217;sandals&#8217; and &#8216;condom&#8217; with &#8217;sprig of silphium&#8217;).This year, though, I decided to use my experience of past SXSWi&#8217;s to produce something more useful. A very specific and completely foolproof guide on surviving this year&#8217;s event. And here it is&#8230;Tip One: Don&#8217;t go to South by Southwest Interactive.I&#8217;m serious. It sucked last year, and it&#8217;s going to suck again this year. You&#8217;re kidding yourself if you think otherwise. The idea that SXSWi is a conference &#8211; or even a festival &#8211; for people doing interesting and useful things in technology is a fallacy. In reality, it&#8217;s just a non-stop orgy of bullshit fanboyism &#8211; a chance for people with stickers on their laptops to go and add more stickers to their laptops; an opportunity for sweaty dorks in Diggnation t-shirts to line up for two hours in the hope of getting Alex Albrecht to &#8211; I dunno &#8211; sign their laptop, I suppose, or maybe give them another freaking sticker. Even the parties &#8211; which are basically the only reason to go &#8211; are horrible: the free bars runs out too soon, and they&#8217;re always rammed with the kind of people who you could be forgiven for assuming have never been inside licenced premises before.&#8220;But Pure Volume at 2am is pretty awesome!&#8221;No it isn&#8217;t. You were just drunk. You&#8217;d lined up for three months to get in with your stupid plastic entry tag and you had to convince yourself that the experience was worthwhile because the only alternative was to kill yourself. Free vodka Red Bulls are not worth the hassle. Take your lead from the pros: buy a couple of bottles of vodka and a case of Red Bull and host your own party in your hotel room. Except you can&#8217;t, can you? Because you&#8217;re sharing with your friend Dan and he has to be up early for the &#8220;Google Hackathon&#8221;.&#8220;But we&#8217;re launching a new app, and it&#8217;s going to be awesome.&#8221;No it isn&#8217;t. But I completely understand why you think it will be. With all those fanboys in one place, where better than &#8216;South by&#8217; to launch your awesome new location-based app?Two years ago, Twitter was the undisputed hit of the festival. Everyone was using it &#8211; to find parties, to silently heckle panels, to do all the things that one can do with Twitter. Last year those same people were so desperate to find the new Twitter that they mistakenly handed that crown to Foursquare on the basis that a relatively small number of Web 2.0 scenesters used it to find out where their friends were partying. And yet, despite that auspicious start, and a shit-ton of publicity since, Foursquare has failed to capture the imagination of even most early adopters, particularly those outside of San Francisco and New York. Foursquare was resolutely not last year&#8217;s Twitter. Last year&#8217;s Twitter was Twitter.That won&#8217;t, however, stop a billion start-ups blowing their entire launch budget on flying their whole team &#8211; armed with sacks of flyers and amusing stick-on bugs and branded candy and more fucking stickers &#8211; to Texas, confident in the knowledge that their app (with its stupid cutesy name) will be the hit of the festival. It won&#8217;t be. It will just be yet another location-based app sloshing about in a sea of location-based apps that may be temporarily useful while a thousand early adopters are crammed into an area of less than one square mile. The moment the festival is over, you&#8217;ll be dead.Instead, this year&#8217;s hot location-based app will be&#8230; Twitter. You&#8217;re welcome. Call me Nostradamus.Last year, while in Austin, I wrote a column for the Guardian talking about the awfulness of the event, saying..&#8220;None of this is surprising, of course, as it all fits neatly into what social media has taught us â\\x80\\x93 that the moment a service or community gets too big, too mainstream or too commercialised, the early adopters declare it &#8220;over&#8221; and move on to the next cool, niche thing. And it&#8217;s why I really hope that next year one or two of those early adopters will organise â\\x80\\x93 and I mean that in the loosest sense â\\x80\\x93 a user-generated unofficial fringe conference to sit alongside the main event. Ideally it will be a bit nerdier and more businessy, and a lot more fun, than SXSW and will have plenty of space for unofficial &#8220;core conversations&#8221; and a great product launch or two.&#8221;Sadly, unless it&#8217;s a very well kept secret, there&#8217;s no such rival event and this year&#8217;s SXSWi will be more of the same bullshit. And for that reason, I&#8217;m totally serious when I say that you shouldn&#8217;t go. Instead &#8211; while your rivals are distracted in Texas, pissing their money up the wall and ejaculating over their laptop stickers during yet another Evan Williams keynote &#8211; you should use the time instead to stay at home and work on building your start-up.Your liver will thank you, your investors will thank you, and most importantly so will millions of real-world users who really want you to create something new and innovative rather than being sucked into the hype and churning out just a better, prettier Twitter-meets-Gowalla clone for the approbation of your peers.Yeah?Yeah.I&#8217;m moderating the &#8220;Unsexy &amp; Profitable: Making $$ Without Hype&#8221; panel on Saturday at 3:30pm in Hilton A/B.See you in Austin.(Photo of Gary Vaynerchuk and Kathy Sierra by Randy Stewart)',\n",

Brian Pokorny is now the CEO of fast-growing Silicon Valley-based Dailybooth.Dailybooth, the runner up in the &#8220;best social app&#8221; and winner of the &#8220;time sink&#8221; categories at this year&#8217;s Crunchies Awards, is &#8220;your life in pictures.&#8221; Some 6 million monthly visitors share pictures and status updates with eachother. &#8220;It&#8217;s a community for self expression,&#8221; says Pokorny. A typical interaction: a users posts a photo, taken with their webcam, showing what they&#8217;re eating, what they&#8217;re feeling, or perhaps with friends in the background. Other user then respond via text or photos. Some strings go on for hundreds of responses.

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier today, Google chief economist Hal Varian gave a presentation to an FTC workshop on the changing economics of the newspaper industry.  We all know that newspaper ad revenues have been falling off a cliff for years.  Many media companies blame Google and are trying to put the genie back in the bottle with partial metered models for online news.Google is understandably on the defensive, trotting out Varian to paint an unemotional picture with as much data as he can muster.  But the picture he paints is a dour one for print media. Â\\xa0For instance, the chart above shows the decline of overall newspaper ad revenues. Â\\xa0Newspapers have taken huge hits in classifieds advertising (in blue) and national brand advertising (in red). Â\\xa0The online portion (green) is still too small to make much of a difference.The collapse in print ad revenues is coming from two places: the overall ad recession of the past couple years and the shift to online news consumption. Â\\xa0Here are some telling stats from Varian&#8217;s presentation, which is also embedded below:About 40% of internet users say read news on the Web every day.Time spent on online news sites is only about 70 seconds per day, compared to 25 minutes spent reading a print edition.Online news readers tend to read at work, not for leisure, so they don&#8217;t have much time to stick around and are thus worth less to advertisers.Overall, less than 5 percent of newspaper ad revenues come from the online editions.Search engines account for 35 to 40 percent of &#8220;traffic to major U.S. news sites,&#8221; according to comScore.The cost of printing and distributing print editions, makes up about half the cost, while editorial operations only make up 15 percent.Varian concludes: &#8220;Newspapers could save a lot of money if the primary access to news was via the internet.&#8221; Â\\xa0It sounds like he agrees with Netscape founder and investor Marc Andreessen, who recommends that newspapers &#8220;burn the boats&#8221; carrying their dying print businesses.&#8220;The fact of the matter is that newspapers have never made much money from news,&#8221; says Varian. Â\\xa0They make money from &#8220;special interest sections on topics such as Automotive, Travel, Home &amp; Garden, Food &amp; Drink,, and so on.&#8221; Â\\xa0The problem is that on the Web, other niche sites which cater to those categories are a click away, leaving the newspapers with sections which are harder to sell ads against, such as sports, news, and local.So what are they supposed to do? Â\\xa0He doesn&#8217;t really have a good answer, but ignoring the realities of consumer shifts in reading behavior and news consumption is not it.    View this document on Scribd',\n",

While the app hasn&#8217;t been updated since late November, a new build is due shortly with one big addition: native Foursquare support.What this means is that anytime someone in your tweet stream sends out a tweet from Foursquare (which, to the annoyance of some users, happens automatically at times), that Foursquare link (shown as a 4sq.com URL) will be able to be opened in Tweetie in a way that displays the location information in a nice format. When a tweet is eligible for this feature, you&#8217;ll see a purple square logo in the upper right hand corner of the tweet in Tweetie.When you click on a Foursquare link, you&#8217;ll be taken to a page that shows the venue&#8217;s address and phone number as well as the Foursquare mayor of the place. If you click on the address you&#8217;ll load a Google Map showing you exactly where it is. If you click on the phone number, you&#8217;ll be able to call the place right from the iPhone. Below all of that, there is a button to open the venue in Foursquare, which launches the Foursquare iPhone app.A couple other new features in Tweetie 2 include Vodpod video uploads and the ability to attach messages along with your TwitPics to that service.Look for this Tweetie 2 update soon in the App Store (it will be version 2.1.1). Meanwhile, Tweetie Two for Mac should be released in a private beta in about a month, according to new info shared on MacHeist today. Tweetie for Mac will soon be added to the nanoBundle 2, and in anticipation, they&#8217;ve added this message:As a MacHeist customer, you&#8217;re not only receiving a free upgrade to the upcoming, highly anticipated Tweetie 2 â\\x80\\x93 we&#8217;ve also arranged exclusive access to the pre-public beta for you guys!Have fun using the best Mac Twitter client for nowâ\\x80¦ and stay tuned for an email from us in about a month with your invite to the future of Mac tweeting.

       "  'comments_content': 'When Chomp launched eight weeks ago  in the iTunes store, it launched as an app for reviewing other iPhone apps.  The app shows you a stream of realtime reviews, which you can filter by everyone or just your Facebook freinds.  The app is showing some traction and should hit 300,000 active monthly users sometime tomorrow, according to co-founder Ben Keighran.While it started out as an app, today Chomp launched a complimentary Website with full app search capabilities and links for each app.  There, users can also see the stream of reviews, as well as dedicated pages for each app and vanity URLs for each reviewer.  Developers can now link to the Chomp reviews directly from inside their apps using Chomp Connect, which also launched today in private beta.  Chomp Connect lets developers add Chomp review buttons right inside their apps without forcing to go anywhere else.  Keighran contends that reviews on iTunes tend to have a more negative bias because people are prompted to submit a review every time they delete an app.  With Chomp Connect, developers can ask their most engaged users to submit reviews.He hopes to make Chomp a social alternative to iTunes reviews.  By driving reviews straight from their apps, developers can promote their apps in the Chomp review stream.  The more reviews, the more often it appears in the stream.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Design submissions are due on the store&#8217;s site by April 11, 2010. The top five designs will be available for community vote at Linux.com through June 6, 2010 and the winning design will be included on T-shirts available for purchase in the Linux.com Store. The lucky designer will be awarded with travel to Boston to attend the Foundation&#8217;s annual conference LinuxCon in August.The Linus Foundation has launched a number of unique initiatives to help raise funds for the organization and its open source initiatives.

       "  'comments_content': 'Facebook is finally going to enter the location game at this April&#8217;s f8 conference, according to a report this morning on the NYT&#8217;s Bits blog.  And they&#8217;re looking to take Google head on.We&#8217;ve been hearing rumors about Facebook&#8217;s location features for a long time, but the buzz has picked up in the last few months.  Those rumors got legs in October, when we noticed that the site had added language explicitly talking about location features to its rewritten privacy policy.The question now is exactly what this location sharing will look like.  I&#8217;ve heard that Facebook has tested simply attaching location data to user status updates, similar to the way Twitter does it. According to the report, Facebook will also offer an API to third parties, presumably allowing services like Foursquare to send their location data into Facebook (it&#8217;s unclear if data will also flow the other way, but I suspect it will once Facebook can get the privacy settings right).Perhaps the most interesting part of the Times piece is the assertion that Facebook isn&#8217;t looking to beat Foursquare, Gowalla, and similar location based services â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0something that I believe it could easily do if it wanted to. Rather, it&#8217;s looking to beat Google in the small-business advertising space. The Times report doesn&#8217;t say much on how exactly Facebook is going to do that, but I suspect it will involve getting as many third parties as possible to integrate its API.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The service has just turned on geolocation on its website today for the first time.While Twitter&#8217;s geolocation feature has been live through its API since last November, there was no sign of integration into the main twitter.com site until now. As you can see in the screenshot above, for tweets tagged with location, right next to the source of the tweet there is a location placemarker. When you hover over it, it turns blue, and clicking on it brings up a little Google map showing the location that tweet was sent from.You can see these maps as overlays both on individual tweet pages, and on tweets in your main stream. In some cases, depending on how Twitter geolocation API is being used, it looks like place names are even passed through to Twitter. For example, here&#8217;s a tweet sent from Foursquare that also says where the tweet is being sent from.The timing of this move by Twitter is significant. Earlier today, the New York Times reported that Facebook would unveil its answer to location next month at its f8 conference. Twitter&#8217;s first-ever Chirp conference takes place just one week before f8. Google, meanwhile, is in the game with Latitude and to some extent Buzz (but could have been in it a lot more). And of course, every app and their mother appears to be launching with some sort of location functionality at the SXSW in Austin, Texas, which begins on Friday. Many of those apps use Twitter&#8217;s geolocation API to pass the data back to Twitter, so it makes sense that this would be a good time to turn the functionality on for the website.Update: It looks like Twitter has just turned off the location functionality after having it on for a bit. Look for it to come back shortly â\\x80\\x94 certainly some time before SXSW.[thanks Chad]CrunchBase Information',\n",

In fact, 75 percent admitted to falling asleep with the iPhone in bed with them, and 69 percent said they were more likely to forget their wallet than their iPhone when leaving in the morning.Is this really addiction? It&#8217;s not clear how many students shed other accessories &#8212; like a watch or an alarm clock &#8212; as a result of their iPhone. I suspect a lot of people are happy to ditch a stand-alone alarm clock at home in favor of using their phone for that task in order to simplify their lives. I&#8217;ve been using my phone as my alarm clock for several months now, and I&#8217;m perfectly happy with it. It goes with me when I travel, so my nighttime routine remains the same, regardless of where I am. And yes, I use my phone as my watch, since I don&#8217;t wear a wristwatch. Using a phone as a timepiece makes perfect sense, especially since the phone automatically updates as you travel around timezones.The survey is not all doom-and-gloom, thankfully:The survey also suggests there are benefits to having an iPhone fixation that may balance out the potential negatives. Over 70 percent of those surveyed said the iPhone made them more organized, and 54 percent said the iPhone made them more productive.My own experiences jive with the Stanford survey. I add little reminders to my calendar all the time to keep me focused and organized.The link above closes with the obvious observation that &#8220;the current survey didn&#8217;t cover attitudes toward other smartphone. [sic] It&#8217;s possible that other phones with similar features might be just as useful and endearing to their owners as the iPhone is to the Stanford students.&#8221; I think this is pretty obvious: I know lots of people who similarly rely on their Blackberries or Androids or Palm Pres to be organized and functional in today&#8217;s always-connected world.I think the real question is not &#8220;are you addicted to your iPhone&#8221;, but rather &#8220;do the applications and features provided by your iPhone change your lifestyle?&#8221; After all, the iPhone itself isn&#8217;t terribly useful beyond time, scheduling, and communications.

       "  'comments_content': '[Germany] Team Europe Ventures, the Berlin-based VC firm, has launched a new â\\x82¬6 million fund for early stage startups in the Internet and mobile Internet space. The fund is mainly targeting companies in Germany and Europe, but also in the USA, and the focus will be on the seed stage, with 4-5 startups being invested in per-year for a maximum of â\\x82¬500K per company.This is bound to be good news for startups in Europe, and particularly in Germany where seed funding is seen to be a problem for early stage companies in the Internet space. Pawel Chudzinski, one of the partners of Team Europe Ventures comments:&#8220;We see a gap in the area of seed investment. For example in Germany there are only very few angel investors who invest six-figure amounts; on the other hand, business angel consortia have various drawbacks, e.g. the problem that none of the investors ever feels wholly responsible, which has negative impacts during due diligance as well as when companies need support in tough times.&#8221;Another thing that Team Europe Ventures are keen to stress is that early stage means, when appropriate, early. Kolja Hebenstreit, also a partner, says:&#8220;We are able to invest in very early stages. If a team is complete, or nearly complete, we&#8217;re happy to come on board during the so called â\\x80\\x98powerpointâ\\x80\\x99 stage. Experience shows that decisive decisions are often made during the foundation phase, so we think itâ\\x80\\x99s good to speak with experienced potential partners as early as possible.&#8221;Team Europe Ventures is managed from Berlin by the its four partners Lukasz Gadowski (founder of Spreadshirt, co-founder of StudiVZ), Kolja Hebenstreit (early employee at Spreadshirt, seed investor in StudiVZ), Pawel Chudzinski (formerly Grennhill &#038; Co.) and Steffen Hoellinger.The firm is currently a shareholder in 15 self founded companies or lead investments as well as 40 co-investments.Aside from the Team Europe Ventures management themselves, the fund&#8217;s investors consist of other Internet entrepreneurs as well as active business angels, including Arend Iven and Ron Hillmann; Dario Suter (film producer, formerly StudiVZ); Matthias SpieÃ\\x9f (Spreadshirt), Heiko Hubertz (Bigpoint), Mueller Medien; GÃ¼nter Faltin (Professor for entrepreneurship and business angel); Jan Becker, Robert Wuttke and Andreas Etten (CGI AG); Kai Bolik, Michael Kalkowski and Boris Wasmuth (Gameduell); Mario Kohle and Robin Behlau (KÃ¤uferportal); Masoud Kamali (Software &#038; Support Verlag); Christoph Janz and Christopher MÃ¼nchhoff.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The debt is being provided by Kreos Capital. This is after raising Â£4m from Accel and Highland only last year. That takes its total funding so far to Â£20 million.Autoquake&#8217;s plan is to disrupt the car retail industry by selling quality used cars on behalf of large corporate fleets and leasing companies direct to consumers via virtual showrooms. High quality pictures of the actual cars on sale appear instead of the usual fuzzy pictures on the average second hand advert.It&#8217;s main draw is that the average 10% discount is higher than most traditional dealers and car supermarkets and since modern cars tend to last much longer, second hand values are higher. Total sales in 2009 were expected to exceed 15,000 cars. They are pushing at an open door. According to Capgemini 44% of consumers in 2009 were are likely or very likely to purchase a car on the internet if that functionality is available.

       "  'comments_content': '[Austria] Platogo, the social games platform, has today released its Platogo Wrapper that enables casual games developers to easily integrate their games with Facebook by inserting a few lines of code.Essentially, it lets any casual game take advantages of the basic social features offered through Facebook, such as the ability for a user to invite and play with friends in their social graph and see how their scores compare, challenge each other, and display their gaming achievements on their Facebook wall.The idea was to offer a solution that &#8220;automatically transforms any casual game into a social gaming experience.&#8221; says Florian Landerl, Product Manager at Platogo. That &#8217;social gaming experience&#8217; on Facebook, of course, also means a casual game has the basis to go viral.Also important from a developer&#8217;s point of view, the actual Facebook app created is owned by them and not Platogo. And so is the relationship with users who can become fans so that developers can keep them updated using Facebook&#8217;s built-in communication channels.Platogo says that its solution also removes the headache of keeping up with Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s endless policy changes. If the social network changes its app rules, Platogo will adapt its wrapper leaving developers to concentrate on making games.As well as a comprehensive API so that, should they wish, develops can add further Platogo-enabled social features, the company offers its own virtual currency for use within games. Called &#8216;Platogo Coins&#8217; it enables developers to earn money by selling in-game virtual goods and is, presumably, how Platogo will make money too along with a share of ad-revenue.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Online private sales is a growing business model that is rapidly becoming a staple of online shopping. Ideeli, Gilt Groupe, Vente-Privee, HauteLook and others are quickly gaining millions of users each and attracting significant amounts of venture funding. But the one issue I find with these sites is that it&#8217;s annoying to have to check each site every day for sales. I subscribe to almost a dozen different sites, which means sorting through the notification emails each day and then logging in and trying to shop on each site. Often the sales take place at the same time, so I need to prioritize which site has more appealing goods for a given day. Today, MyNines is emerging  to streamline the private sale space by offering a Kayak.com for private sale sites. MyNines aggregates products from various online sample sale sites and allows shoppers to find them all in location.  Users can search and filter by designer, category, highest discounts, as well as deals ending soonest, most viewed items, deals under $100, and newly listed. MyNines currently aggregates from 14 different private sale sites including, Billion Dollar Babes, Ebay FashionVault, Wired For Wine, Gomatta Girls, Guiltless Purse, Left Lane Sports, Reverse, Enviius, BeautyTicket, BonVoyou,  Editor&#8217;s Closet,  DD Push and JomaShop. You can also set up customized alerts to notify you via email or SMS whenever products or designers of interest go on sale from the sites MyNines partners with. The site makes money off of affiliate fees on CPA basis. The site also wants to generate revenue down the line from providing white-label platform solution to traditional retailers. The idea behind MyNines seems brilliant, especially considering the success of Kayak when it comes to the online travel industry. But one of the challenges of the model is signing on the private sale sites to release their API to MyNines. But the startup&#8217;s founder Apar Kothari says that she is currently in talks with a number of other well-known sample sale sites. It&#8217;s unclear whether the private sale market will be open to the type of convergence that has taken place in the travel industry. First and foremost, most, if not all, of the vendors will need to be on board with the aggregation model in order for it to succeed. As of now, MyNines has been able to attract some of the more well known players in the space, including Billion Dollar Babes and eBay&#8217;s FashionVault. And if consumers respond in a positive way, then other sites like Gilt and HauteLook may jump on board. CrunchBase Information',\n",

That is how many sites are running on the hosted version of StatusNet, which went into private beta at our Realtime CrunchUp last November.  Today, StatusNet is opening up its hosted service to all comers in a public beta.You can think about StatusNet as the WordPress of microblogging.  StatusNet is open-source software which can either be downloaded and run on your own enterprise servers or now on StatusNet&#8217;s hosted servers.  Basic service is free, with plans to charge for premium levels down the line.  The premium versions will be ad-free, support unlimited users, larger file sizes, your own domain and design, Facebook and Twitter integration, and XMPP feeds.CEO Evan Prodromou describes the various ways StatusNet can be used: as an open-source microblogging server akin to WordPress, as the basis for an online community &#8220;(ning.com for microblogging); for enterprise (Open Source Yammer), or for a single user to own their social media presence (your own ping.fm).&#8221;  One of the cooler features of StatusNet is OStatus, which lets you follow people on different social networks all from within your hosted microblogging enevironment.The largest site hosted on StatusNet is the company&#8217;s own identi.ca, but StatusNet will also be hosting microblogging sites for ABC News, Shit My Dad Says (not live yet at the time of this posting), the Twit Army, Kirsty Ally&#8217;s weight loss community Phitter, Germany&#8217;s Bleeper, and Today&#8217;s Mama.  All together, there are more than 1 million registered users across all 10,000 StatusNet sites.Shit My Dad Says has 1.2 million followers on Twitter and a TV pilot in the works starring William Shatner.  He will use StatusNet to push his updates to Twitter while controlling the advertising.  ABC News plans to use StatusNet as a central dashboard to push out its headlines and updates to different social networks.  Update: Apparently, ABC News changed its mind and won&#8217;t be using the service now.StausNet is based in Montreal and raised $1 million in seed capital last year.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;ve written about Plancast, a &#8220;Foursquare For The Future,&#8221; that essentially broadcasts your plans to your online social circle. We&#8217;re big fans of the startup, which just raised seed funding from an impressive group of investors. Startup Go Tribal is rolling out a different take on the social planning application, launching a site for a more targeted audience: women. Go Tribal has simple ambitions. The site basically aims to help women answer the question, &#8220;who&#8217;s down to go out?&#8221; Users can sign set up an account and  broadcast message to their friends to see who is down for going out. Of course, you can tap into your social graph via Facebook Connect, Gmail and Twitter, but all of the planning needs to take place on Go Tribal&#8217;s site and each participant needs to sign up for an account to start &#8220;planning.&#8221; Once you see which friends are available, you can vote on, discuss, and finalize your plans. In terms of privacy, there are three levels of privacy for plans.  You can opt to go public with your plans, private (plans are only visible to your Go Tribal friends) or locked (plans are only visible to the people invited to the plan). Go Tribal is oriented towards helping member form informal plans, like grabbing a impromptu dinner with friends. Shruti Challa, CEO and co-founder of Go Tribal, says the service aims to eliminate planning via text, email or Facebook. But one of the virtues of these mediums and networks is that all three can be easily accessible from your mobile device. Although Go Tribal  doesn&#8217;t have a mobile app available, the startup offers SMS notifications so that you can stay up-to-date with any changes to a plan. So how does the startup make money? Well, because Go Tribal has a targeted audience, it can offer targeted advertising to restaurants, bars and other local establishments. Challa says that the site is also in the process of incorporating deals at certain restaurants and bars. It should be interesting to see if Go Tribal can take off. The conventional behavior for people to make casual plans usually takes place over email, Facebook or SMS. It may be tough for the startup to change that natural behavior right away, but with an attractive interface and the proper partnerships (I&#8217;m thinking a Yelp or CitySearch partnership), the site could find a loyal following.

       "  'comments_content': '3D TVs are coming whether we want them to or not. TV makers and content providers aren&#8217;t testing the water &#8211; they&#8217;re jumping head-first and pulling consumers in, too. But like high definition a few years back, early adapters will be forced to pay a high premium and suffer through a format war of sort before it really catches on.Take a look at Sony&#8217;s just-announced 3D lineup: The company announced eight 3D BRAVIA TVs for the Japanese market along with a set of necessary 3D accessories, which will compete against Panasonic and Samsung sets when they all eventually hit the market in the coming months. Nevermind that the US models might be slightly different. Let&#8217;s talk about the multiple steps needed to watch 3D content on your brand new 3D TV.First you have to get a 3D TV. That much is obvious and you&#8217;ll have a few options to choose from. Sears is already taking pre-orders for Samsung models and Best Buy is kicking off 3D TV with Panasonic this morning. At this point we really don&#8217;t know which brand or model is better, so let&#8217;s assume they are all nearly the same and go with the new Sony&#8217;s for the sake of moving forward.So you have your new Sony 3D TV. Good for you. But you might have noticed that your brand new TV didn&#8217;t come with 3D glasses. Those cost extra &#8212; $140 in Japan. At least they will be available in gray, blue, and pink. But you&#8217;re still not done. You&#8217;ll need to buy the $60 3D &#8220;synchro transmitter&#8221; that ensures the glasses stay synced with the TV.But you still can&#8217;t watch 3D content because there isn&#8217;t any right now. A few 3D Blu-ray movies are scheduled to come out this summer, but you&#8217;ll need a special Blu-ray player to watch them. Sony just started sell a few, but they can&#8217;t output the 3D content until they receive firmware that&#8217;s supposed to be out in a couple of months.It&#8217;s true that ESPN and Discovery announced that they both plan on launching a 3D TV station. ESPN will start broadcasting only special events like the World Cup this summer. Discovery 3D should be on the air sometime in 2011. But it&#8217;s up to your cable or satellite provider to get you the station.This is a hot mess, right? It gets worse, pal.Let&#8217;s say you jump in and spend the cash on a nice Sony 3D setup, complete with the Blu-ray player and pink glasses. Those same 3D glasses will not work on your buddies Samsung 3D TV or with your NVIDIA 3D Vision computer setup. You&#8217;re stuck watching the World Cup alone because each brand of 3D TV requires its own 3D glasses.There is no denying that 3D is here to stay. It&#8217;s the only viable option manufacturers have to get consumers to upgrade from their just-purchased HDTV. But it might be wise to sit on the sidelines for the first couple of rounds until the TV makers get some standards hammered out. You just saw Avatar in 3D anyway and soccer is probably just as boring in 3D as it is is in 2D.',\n",

Today Sobees is releasing a new version of its Windows native desktop app built in .NET, complete with realtime search, a redesign and more. The new client includes support for Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, FriendFeed and LinkedIn (which was added  late last year). The most significant addition is the availability of realtime search on the client, with the ability to search Twitter, Friendfeed, OneRiot and FacteryLabs from within the application. Sobees integrated elements of its newly launched realtime web dashboard to power search in the client. Sobees has also added drag and drop technology for columns in order to change the place of a column within the client. Other technical updated include the ability to preview Tweets and maps, translate messages, and see pictures posted on TwitPic from within the Tweet. And Sobees will break out threaded conversations you have with friends. Sobees is competing in a crowded space where each client continues to innovate and offer users more options for managing their social media accounts and the reealtime web. For example, Seesmic has incorporated Ping.fm, to allows users to update more than 50 different social networks at the same time.  And TweetDeck now incorporates YouTube and Flickr within its client. For now, Sobees doesn&#8217;t have any mobile clients but we are told that iPhone and Android apps are coming soon. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google&#8217;s recently announced $25 million acquisition of DocVerse represented one saga of an ongoing war between Google and Microsoft over dominance in the productivity suite place. Today, Israeli enterprise software company Mainsoft is launching a Docverse-like plug-in that may up the ante in the battle. Harmony is launching free plug-ins that bring Google Docs documents and Microsoft SharePoint document libraries directly to Microsoft Outlook. Once downloaded, Harmony for Google Docs will open in a sidebar pane within Outlook. The new Harmony sidebar enables people to share a single, centralized copy of the document, eliminating the many intermediary steps associated with sending e-mail attachments back and forth. The plug-in allows users to locate, share, and work on Google documents directly from their email client. Once logged in to your Google account, you&#8217;ll be able to drag any files (ie Microsoft Word files, PDFs) directly from an email to the Harmony sidebar to upload and convert them to Google documents. You can drag a Google document from the sidebar to create links in your e-mail messages and meeting requests to other users and viewers. Harmony automatically shares the document with the recipients. You can decide to give recipients read or write access. Recipients simply click the link in the message to open the document in their browser and don&#8217;t need to have Harmony installed to view the document.Harmony also allows you to search document contents on Google Docs from the Harmony search box and locate documents using the View Bar, which allows you to switch between common views, such as spreadsheets, starred items, items owned by or shared with you, and more. One of the major features of Harmony is the ability to actually open and edit Google documents from directly in Outlook. All your changes are saved online and are available to your colleagues. You can organize and create folders to store Google Docs and also save Google documents in Office format. Harmony can export Google documents to Office, Open Office, PDF, RTF, HTML, TXT, and image formats.The SharePoint plug-in isn&#8217;t nearly as sexy as as the Google Docs app but still offers a useful set of tools for enterprise users. The plug-in aims to transform Microsoft Outlook into a collaboration console, with access to documents stored on SharePoint.  Similar to the Google Docs plug-in, you can drag e-mail attachments or entire e-mail messages to publish them on SharePoint. You can search the contents of documents in your current SharePoint site or library and share documents via e-mail message, calendar appointment, or task. You can edit a document from within Outlook, view document history and more. Harmony was built using SharePoint Web Services interfaces and Google Docs open APIs and in the process has transformed Microsoft Outlook into a more collaborative application. Most importantly, the Google Docs plug-in makes the transition between web-based documents and the desktop email client seamless. It gives Microsoft users the best of both worlds, much like Docverse did with Microsoft Word documents and web-based files. If you use Microsoft Outlook and Google Docs, the plug-in seems like a no brainer to download. Plus its conveniently free. Considering the fate of Docverse, it may only be a matter of time before Microsoft and Google come sniffing around Harmony. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Since its launch almost exactly a year ago, Foursquare&#8217;s website has largely had the same basic design. Tonight, it looks like that&#8217;s finally getting updated.While it looks like the update is still in the process of rolling out to all the pages, Foursquare.com now clearly has new system-wide toolbars, a brand new sign-up page, as well as some new settings. You might also notice a new, name-only logo.While it&#8217;s been clear for a while that Foursquare has been working on a site redesign, only in the past few days have signs started to show that it was coming. For example, a completely revamped History area showed up a few days ago, one allowing for venues to have categories as well as show which friends you checked-in with at places.The biggest part of the changes currently rolling out is to the sign-up page. The new step-by-step process looks highly influenced by Twitter&#8217;s sign-up page (which they too tweaked a few times over the years). The process now allows you to sign up, easily find friends already using Foursquare via Twitter or Facebook Connect, as well as link up to those aforementioned networks. After you do that, there&#8217;s a one-page rundown of what you can do with Foursquare (such as download one of the mobile apps, earn badges, and explore cities).These sign-up pages are important for convincing new users to not only sign up, but also showing them what to do. With Foursquare signing mainstream deals left and right, they&#8217;re going to need this.Something else that appears to be new: an option in the setting page for Â\\xa0letting local businesses see that you have checked-in at their venue. When you click the link to learn more, it says:We allow verified venue owners to see statistics about checkins at their venue. These stats include recent visitors, most frequent visitors and most popular checkin times. You can always opt out if you&#8217;d rather not share this data with the venues you visit.Sadly, with the redesign, there is still no way to check-in from the site itself. You have to use one of the app, the mobile web, or text messaging to do that.Speaking of mobile apps, Foursquare is about to launch a completely redesigned iPhone app as well. All of these moves are necessary if Foursquare is going to keep up with its better-designed rival, Gowalla (which also just revamped its website).Something else interesting from tonight: apparently the concept of &#8220;checking-in&#8221; made its onscreen debut on the popular TV show Gossip Girl. Co-founder Dennis Crowley noted the move and tweeted out a picture of it captured from the show. While there is no specific mention of Foursquare, it seems obvious (at least to Crowley) what they&#8217;re paying homage to. And Foursquare actually has paid homage the other way, with its &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221; badge.The move towards the mainstream continues â\\x80\\x94 or maybe Elizabeth Fisher was just actually checking-in to that hotel.

No purchase is required at any store, and karma points can be redeemed nine predefined good causes. Big brands like Kraft Foods and Citi (both are on board) then turn the karmas into real dollar donations to those causes. Food for poor families, water in Sudan, trees in the Amazon, etc. are examples of the causes.The company has now donated about half of the original $500,000 donated by Kraft and Citi for the test period. And these brands seem to be happy. CauseWorld has been downloaded more than 300,000 times, probably putting it on par with location based check in networks like FourSquare.

And now Citi will announce that it is expanding it&#8217;s support of CauseWorld. It&#8217;s total contribution is now at $700,000.The charity angle on CauseWorld is brilliant and gives users an added incentive to check in at retail stores.

Citi&#8217;s total contribution now stands at $700,000. About half has already been given to the causes by Citi on behalf of CauseWorld shoppers.Citi also announced that the CauseWorld application would add two microfinance organizations â\\x80\\x93 BRAC and ACCION USA â\\x80\\x93 to its cadre of causes to which shoppers with the app may now donate.&#8220;Already, the CauseWorld app is having a strong impact. It speaks volumes about the potential power of location-based mobile services. Citi continues to explore ways to bring new value, including convenience and smarter ways to use money, to customers and potential customers by working with leading companies, VCs, and startups like shopkick,&#8221; said Jeff Semenchuk, head of Citiâ\\x80\\x99s Growth Ventures unit.  &#8220;Citi is committed to meeting our customers&#8217; emerging mobile, retail and payment needs,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The CauseWorld app is proving to be a very effective way for Citi to support leading social impact-focused nonprofit institutions. The fact that shoppers are making the decisions makes it all the more interesting. We&#8217;re pleased that the CauseWorld app will also now include two of the leading microfinance organizations, BRAC and ACCION USA,&#8221; said Robert Annibale, Global Director of Citi Microfinance and Community Relations.ACCION USA brings affordable microfinance solutions to small business owners.

Shopper-generated â\\x80\\x9ckarmaâ\\x80\\x9d will help provide microcredit loans to give poor women in Africa the tools they need to generate income for themselves and their families.CauseWorld users will be able to donate to BRAC and ACCION USA immediately.Since its December 23 launch, Citi has helped support a number of important causes through CauseWorld, including providing clean water for  people in developing countries such as Sudan, providing  meals to families in the US, planting  trees as well as donating books. CauseWorld users are also benefiting Haitian and Chilean earthquake relief efforts.&#8220;Citi saw the potential in CauseWorld before the app was even built,&#8221; said shopkick CEO Cyriac Roeding. &#8220;It&#8217;s every entrepreneur&#8217;s dream to work with people who &#8216;get&#8217; the idea, even before it becomes reality.  Citi&#8217;s new microfinance causes and additional financial contribution underscore their focus on creating sustainable impact.&#8221;  shopkick is backed by Kleiner Perkins and Reid Hoffman.The CauseWorld application, available for Apple&#8217;s iPhone and Google&#8217;s Android, was released in December.  The CauseWorld app works by allowing iPhone and Android users to collect &#8220;karmas&#8221; by opening the app and &#8220;checking-in&#8221; when they come close to, or enter, retail stores. Karmas are then funded by Citi and Kraft Foods so that the user can spend collected karmas on real world charitable actions like planting trees, feeding families in America or providing clean water to people in Sudan.Once the chosen action has been carried out by the charity partner, users can publish their good deeds to their Facebook feed, so all of their friends can see their pride and join in supporting good causes. A list of participating retail stores is included in the CauseWorld app and no purchase is necessary at the stores to earn karmas. With the addition of BRAC and ACCION USA, eleven charities have partnered with the CauseWorld App including: American Red Cross, Feeding America, American Forests, GlobalGiving, DonorsChoose.org, Prevent Child Abuse America, Carbonfund.org, American Humane Association and Room to Read.How it works:Â·           Users download the free app on their iPhone.Â·           Collect karmas, the currency created from sponsorship money from Kraft Foods and Citi, by visiting participating retail locations.Â·           Spend karmas on real world charitable actions like planting trees, feeding the hungry and providing clean drinking water.Â·           Charities carry out the actions.Â·           Publish on Facebook to show friends and family.Â·           Build up a profile with icons showing all your karma expenditure.Â·           Earn badges and level up by earning more karma.The CauseWorld App is available for free from the App Store on iPhone or at www.causeworld.com/iphone.

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s a little surprising to see a Twitter application coming out of Fuze Box (formerly CallWave), which creates visual collaboration product. The company has clearly caught the Twitter bug (albeit a little late) and today is launching Tweetshare, an third party Twitter app that allows anyone to immediately publish any type of content to the web, including  HD video, presentations, images and more and automatically start Twitter conversation threads around their content. It&#8217;s kind of like FriendFeed meets Twitpic or Twitvid. Tweetshare has also rolled out a companion iPhone app that allows mobile  users to upload content, tweet and create discussions on the Tweetshare platform. A social alternative to static landing pages, Tweetshare aims to be a Twitterfied-Facebook Fan Page. Twitter users can post relevant content, such as presentations, images, videos and PDFs, and can also Tweet from the platform. Any comments made on a Tweetshare page or similarly, made on Twitter in response to posted content is also threaded on the page. A free application, Tweetshare also provides measurement and analytics tools, including polling functionality and the ability for users to become a fan of a brandâ\\x80\\x99s Tweetshare Fan Page. And similar to YouTube channels and Facebook pages, Tweetshare Fan Pages can be branded and customized. The site is missing Facebook connect, but Fuze Box says this will be rolled out soon. Of course, Mixx offers branded Twitter channels through TweetMixx, which offer some of the functionality of Tweetshare. And Tweetmeme also offers a similar product. Its unclear if there is any monetization that can be made from the Tweetshare, but the application seems that it could be useful. Fuze Box has a pretty unique history as far as startups go. CallWave was founded in 1998 and went public in 2004, trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol CALL. After reaching a peak soon thereafter of over $15 per share, the stock dropped steadily, dipping as low as 50 cents early this year. Deciding to cut its losses, the company delisted itself from NASDAQ on Monday after buying back shares from public shareholders at a 44% premium over the current market value and paying out a total of $10 million. Last summer, the company rebranded itself as Fuze Box and launched Fuze Meeting, which itâ\\x80\\x99s pitting as a sleeker, lighter, and cheaper alternative to services like WebEx. Although the company has experienced some tough times over the past few years, it appears to be in a better place now. And the startup is obviously broadening its product base. However, while a little late to the Twitter frenzy, Fuze Box is moving in the right direction. \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last October, developer Loren Brichter set the App Store on fire with the sequel to his brilliant iPhone Twitter client, Tweetie. It looks like he&#8217;s about to do the same to the Mac.Brichter sent out a series of teasing tweets today indicating that Tweetie Two is coming soon for the Mac. One, from his atebits account, reads:Ready&#8230; ready?! News about Tweetie Tw&#8230; ROOOOOAAAAR!! NOOOO DON&#8217;T EAT M *BLAM BLAM*. *CHOMMMPP* Aaaaararrrrrgghhhhhh.While clearly he&#8217;s about to say &#8220;News about Tweetie Two,&#8221; that in and of itself isn&#8217;t very useful. The more useful tweet comes from his personal Twitter account, where he links to a &#8220;leaked&#8221; screenshot, &#8220;Shhh, @atebits doesn&#8217;t know I&#8217;m leaking screenshots.&#8221;Â\\xa0To which he replies to himself, &#8220;Damn you @lorenb!&#8221; Cute.Better is the screenshot itself (below). While it doesn&#8217;t show much of anything beyond what seems to be a frame for Tweetie Two (which he humorously calls &#8220;Tweetie Too&#8221;) â\\x80\\x94 or just an awful-looking joke â\\x80\\x94 the fact that work is far enough along to for him to feel comfortable talking about it at all is a good sign.Brichter released Tweetie for Mac last April, following the success of Tweetie (the first one) for the iPhone. It costs you $20 for the ad-free version, but it is well worth it if you&#8217;re addicted to Twitter want want a native, non-AIR app (though Echofon has a nice one as well).So what else do we know about Tweetie Two for the Mac? Brichter actually set up a Formspring.me account where he has answered some questions himself. Notably, the pricing for Tweetie Two will be the same as the first one. Brichter basically spends all his time on the project. And he even designs it himself. Also, &#8220;The interface is going to be substantially different,&#8221; he writes.Finally, when asked if he plans to develop for the upcoming iPad, Brichter has just two words, &#8220;Hell yeah.&#8221; Tweetie for iPad, anyone?Update: Brichter emailed us to say that the tweets were &#8220;Just having some fun (have been so busy that I haven&#8217;t had much time to tweet recently).He also notes that there&#8217;s some interesting news involving Tweetie tomorrow at MacHeist. Judging from the page, it looks like Tweetie 2 could be added to the nanoBundle 2, a collection of excellent Mac apps for just $19.95.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Less than 3 months later, Lima Sky has managed to triple an already impressive haul.At 99 cents a pop, this game has pulled in at least $2.97 million in revenue since it launched in March of 2009. Given that Apple takes 30% of all sales revenue, that works out to about $891,000 for the folks in Cupertino, and $2.08 million for the two brothers behind Lima Sky.

       "  'comments_content': 'Every place and object in the world has a secret past: who lived there, who passed by, who touched it. The secret lives of objects are filled with such details.  If only you could make them talk.  But what if you could give any physical object a story simply by sticking a barcode on it and appending a message to that barcode?  The message could be a photo, a text message, a video, or a voice note.  All anyone would need to unlock the message is a phone with a special barcode scanning app.Stickybits is that app.  Founded by Billy Chasen (the original programmer behind Chartbeat)  and Seth Goldstein (chairman and founder of SocialMedia), the startup just closed a $300,000 seed round from Polaris Venture Partners and Mitch Kapor.  Officially launching this week at Austin&#8217;s SXSW festival, stickybits is a new mobile app for both the iPhone and Android.  It lets you scan any barcode and attach a message to that physical object.  The barcode in a greeting card , for instance, could trigger a video message from the sender.  One on a box of medical supplies could inventory what is inside.  A business card with a code on it could link to a resume or LinkedIn profile.  Museums and theme parks could use them for audio tours and maps.  Local merchants could use the barcodes to track deliveries or place them in their storefront windows to distribute digital coupons and offers to passersby.  The possibilities are endless.The app is free, but stickybits sells packs of 20 vinyl barcode stickers for $10.  You also can download and print your own barcodes for free, or scan an existing one on a physical product like a can of Coke.  (Future business model: charge brands to claim their barcodes and place their own messages first).  Each barcode is programmable by the first person who scans it and and leaves a photo, video, audio, or text message.  The next time somebody scans that barcode, the previous message will appear on their phone.  Anyone can add a new message to the same code, resulting in a stream of messages connected to whatever object or place the barcode is stuck on.  Each scan, and related message, is geo-tagged so you can see as an object moves around how its story evolves.  The app lets you follow people and see their object stream, or get notified whenever one of your objects is scanned, moved, or new bits are attached to them. You can toggle between stream and map views. It supports Facebook Connect for login and any scan can be broadcast out to Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare.  With Foursquare, it actually gives you the option to check into the place where you are by scanning the barcode.If stickybits sounds like science fiction that may be because they share some attributes with author Bruce Sterling&#8217;s concept of &#8220;Spimes&#8221; (later fleshed out in his book Shaping Things):The most important thing to know about Spimes is that they are precisely located in space and time. They have histories. They are recorded, tracked, inventoried, and always associated with a story.Spimes have identities, they are protagonists of a documented process.They are searchable, like Google. You can think of Spimes as being auto-Googling objects.Sterling predicted Spimes will eventually be designed into all objects, and contain their histories, raw materials, ingredients, ownership history and other data.  Perhaps stickybits are first steps in that direction.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Tomorrow it will be exactly one month since the launch of Google Buzz. The song remains the same: it&#8217;s a mess. Normally, that wouldn&#8217;t bother me so much â\\x80\\x94 after all, a lot of services are a mess â\\x80\\x94 but Buzz has a lot of potential. But again, it&#8217;s been a month. I&#8217;m starting to wonder if it will ever reach that potential. I&#8217;m also starting to wonder if it shouldn&#8217;t have been introduced as something entirely different.Despite its many annoyances, I&#8217;ve been using Buzz regularly over the past month (Gmail integration tends to shove it in your face and I hate unread counts). The one thing I keep coming back to is that Buzz on the iPhone and Android is pretty impressive. Specifically, the location functionality as run through the mobile web is impressive. In fact, that&#8217;s what I think Buzz should have started out as.Yes, I know Google already has a location-based service: Latitude. But let&#8217;s be honest: no one uses Latitude. Or if they do, they likely don&#8217;t even realize they&#8217;re using it because it&#8217;s just turned on in the background. And that&#8217;s precisely why Latitude doesn&#8217;t work.The past several months have proven that consumer demand for location services is contingent on one thing: the ability to &#8220;check-in.&#8221; That is, rather than having a service that is always on in the background transmitting your location (like Latitude), people are actually using the services that allow you to dictate when and where your location is sent out (like Foursquare and Gowalla). There&#8217;s a reason that services like Loopt has pivoted from one method to the other.Checking-in works for people because of two main things: simplicity (of the concept) and privacy. People prefer checking-in because it makes sense. You hit a button to say you&#8217;re somewhere, and it gets transmitted. You don&#8217;t have to worry about whether your mobile device is always transmitting because you&#8217;re in complete control of it. In the future, as people become more comfortable with the concept, I suspect some form of &#8220;always-on&#8221; location will become the norm, but for now, it&#8217;s baby-steps.And that&#8217;s why Latitude, as it&#8217;s currently built, doesn&#8217;t work for most people. But Buzz â\\x80\\x94 the mobile version, at least â\\x80\\x94 is the location-based service that Google should have built. It has the idea of checking-in built into it; you simply do so by buzzing from your device. When you do that, Google offers you the opportunity to tag your buzz to a certain place and instantly send it out to your followers.That&#8217;s another key to why Buzz (and check-in services as a whole) works as a location service: with it, Google finally understands that people don&#8217;t want to let others know their GPS coordinates. That means nothing to most people. Instead, Buzz lets you select an actual place (like a restaurant, for example), and send that out with your message.People understand the concept of places, not coordinates. And Google, thanks to its Search and Maps businesses, happens to have databases of more places than probably any other company out there. With Buzz, they&#8217;re finally using it.As a sharing service within Gmail, Buzz isn&#8217;t ready for primetime yet. As a location service, Buzz could have been a serious challenger to Foursquare, Gowalla, Brightkite, Loopt, and all the others preparing for big launches at SXSW later this week. Imagine Buzz as a location-based iPhone and Android app (or even just a web app). It still could have been linked to your Google Profile and perhaps would have even been a better gateway drug to making Google more social because it would have been a more gradual build-up.And to ensure some usage beyond Google Profiles, Google could have put Buzz in Gmail Labs, as an option for Gmail. As a broken social sharing service, Buzz in Gmail is annoying. But as a location-based stream of check-ins (that people could still comment on and like), it&#8217;s potentially interesting. And it still would have been exposed to millions of potential users that way. And some users could have even used browser location features to use it within Gmail (Google Chrome is one of the browsersÂ\\xa0testing this natively).Google could have kept the Buzz button on its mobile interface for easy check-in/update ability from all of its mobile apps. And Buzz built-in to the native Maps application on Android is simply brilliant.As a location-based app, Google would have likely been instantaneously bigger than all of its rivals. This is the key reason people suggest that when Facebook enters the location game, it will wipe out the other players â\\x80\\x94 it&#8217;s the huge built-in user base.Then the next step could have been to more directly emphasize the concept of sharing. That would have been to opposite approach of Twitter, which first was all about sharing, and more recently hasÂ\\xa0added the location layer (which Facebook is also likely to do at some point this year).Â\\xa0But that makes sense for Google, since the social elements have been their weak point and no one yet has a huge stranglehold over the location space.Instead, right now, Buzz is oddly split between this sharing service within Gmail and this location-based service that exists on the mobile web. They should have focused on the latter, used the location buzz (pun intended) at SXSW to take out their upstart rivals, and then morphed into a social sharing service down the road. Then they would have been well-positioned (and perhaps more importantly, better prepared) to take on the more established social sharing sites, Twitter and Facebook.Oh well. Time to go mute some more posts on the Buzz we&#8217;re stuck with.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the last month or so, Apple has clearly been on a mission to trim down the App Store to applications that are useful and family friendly.  First, it removed thousands of sex-themed applications, and it&#8217;s also been making moves to crack down on overly simplistic &#8216;cookie cutter&#8216; apps. But there may be yet another segment of the App Store on the chopping block: Books.  According to a recent report, books represent 27,000 of the App Store&#8217;s 150,000 applications, making them the most abundant type of application on the App Store.  And they&#8217;re becoming increasingly redundant.Before developers get alarmed, I should make it clear that I haven&#8217;t heard anything about Apple removing the myriad book apps from the App Store.  But given the impending release of Apple&#8217;s own iBooks app alongside the iPad, and the recent App Store cleanup spree, I won&#8217;t be at all surprised if they do something to change the way books are treated on the platform.There are a few reasons why Apple might want to do this.  First and foremost, there&#8217;s the user experience for new iPad users.  One of the iPad&#8217;s highly touted features is its ability to read books using the new iBooks application, which serves as both a book store and a very nice looking eBook reader.  But according to Apple&#8217;s website, iBooks won&#8217;t come pre-installed on the iPad.  You can be sure that Apple will give its own application top billing on the App Store, but there will still be plenty of room for confusion.Imagine what will happen when a new iPad user boots up the device for the first time and decides to buy Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but instead of doing it through the iBooks app, they simply run a search on the App Store.  There are at least 25 different standalone applications featuring the book, selling for between 99 cents and five dollars.  Each of these applications has its own book reading interface, many of which aren&#8217;t nearly as polished as the iBooks app Apple has shown off.  And every time the user downloads a different book from the App Store, they&#8217;ll be using yet another new interface.  That doesn&#8217;t seem like the sort of user experience Apple typically strives for.And then there&#8217;s the issue of App Store clutter.  As I mentioned before, Apple seems to be focused on eliminating many of the frivolous applications from the App Store. There are plenty of high quality book applications available, but there are also quite a few â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0perhaps even the majorityÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94 that amount to little more than a Project Gutenberg text wrapped in an overly basic reader. Which is exactly the sort of thing Apple is tired of.  Books already make up the most popular category of application on the App Store;Â\\xa0if they keep growing at this pace, they&#8217;ll eventually represent the majority of applications available.To be clear, I don&#8217;t think Apple is going to ban book markets like Amazon&#8217;s Kindle reader or Stanza. These generally have much more functionality than a basic book app, and eliminating them would be blatantly anti-competitive. That may not have any legal repercussions, but Apple badly needs high quality applications on the iPad to make it a success â\\x80\\x94 it would be unwise to scare off major developers wary of having their app blocked because Apple has a competing product (this is one reason, I think, that iBooks is not included with the iPad).All of that said, there are some reasons why Apple may not do anything on this front.  For one, Apple is probably making a decent chunk of revenue from paid book applications, so it may not particularly care whether it gets its revenue cut from the app vendor or the publisher itself through iBooks.  And then there&#8217;s the PR cost. Apple got away with unceremoniously removing thousands of &#8217;sexy&#8217; applications because nobody is going to stand up and defend their right to view titillating bikini photos.  But if Apple pulled thousands of books from the store, the headlines could be more damaging, with imagery of book bonfires abound (despite the fact that the same content would likely be available through iBooks).Or Apple may find some middle ground. It could hide book apps from iPad search results and keep them iPhone-only Â\\xa0(though the iPhone will probably get a version of iBooks, too).   It might just start blocking new book submissions but leave the existing apps be.  Or perhaps it will include some kind of banner on relevant searches like &#8220;Did you know this title is also available on iBooks?&#8221;. In any case, while I am by no means advocating such a change, I suspect that if you want to download one of these standalone book applications in the not-so-distant future, you&#8217;re going to have to go out of your way to do it.Update: As commenter Peter Cooper points out, iBooks is only going to be available in the US at launch, and some developers are working towards books that can do far more than &#8216;normal&#8217; book readers (including iBooks).  So there are clearly reasons to keep the Book section intact, but I still suspect changes are coming to the way Apple handles book applications (at least the basic ones).Apple&#8217;s iBooksTop image by AustinevanCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'One common complaint about Foursquare is that in a increasingly crowded location-based space, it&#8217;s not pretty enough when compared to the likes of Brightkite and Gowalla. The new iPhone app launching soon should help that. But for some, it still won&#8217;t be enough. Those people should definitely check out Fourface.Fourface is a free iPhone app built using Foursquare&#8217;s API. It takes the basic functionality of the service (check-ins, seeing who else is at a venue) and puts a stylish user interface on top of it. Specifically, you can choose from &#8220;Arcs,&#8221; &#8220;Clouds,&#8221; &#8220;Bubbles,&#8221; and &#8220;Spots,&#8221; for your new interface. Each offers a slightly different way to interact with Foursquare, and different ways to do things such a check-in. With Bubbles, for example, you simply find the venue bubble you want (represented by different colors) and hold it to check-in.Another view, Spots, allows you to click on different areas to see how many people are there (represented by different color bubbles), or get a list of names for who is actually at the venue. Other new interfaces are in the works that you will be able to purchase through the app, apparently.Fourface is the work of Nodesnoop, a Los Angeles-based iPhone app house that also makes a couple games for the platform. One of them, Mobzombies, is also location-based and also works with Foursquare data.You can find Fourface in the App Store here.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'We have written repeatedly that Windows itself is one of the main reasons why touchscreen computers have never caught the general public&#8217;s attention. The interface just wasn&#8217;t designed for finger input. Like it or not, that&#8217;s the truth. Windows was designed to be used with a mouse, and to a lesser extent, a pen or stylus.That&#8217;s fine. Windows 7 works great. I&#8217;m writing this on a Win7 machine. But I hate Windows on my tablet computers for the aforementioned reason. It&#8217;s also the reason I&#8217;m very apprehensive of the upcoming onslaught of slate computers. I&#8217;m afraid that wonderful hardware will be passed up in favor of the disappointing iPad because of the interface. But Adobe gave me hope today in its demo of Flash and Air on the HP slate device.The first minute or so of the demo is Adobe&#8217;s Flash Product Marketing manager talking about this and that. The real fun comes at the 1:30 mark. That&#8217;s when we get a glimpse of what appears to be an HP app manager that has clearly been designed for a touch interface. The buttons are large, uses stars to mark favorites programs or Internet shortcuts, and seems responsive enough. It&#8217;s probably safe to say that it&#8217;s an Adobe product seeing as it makes an appearance in this demo.Even the browser seems to have been made over for the touch interface, which seems to be a custom build of Firefox. Of course it has all the multi-touch goodies like pinch zooming and two-finger scrolling, but it also feels different, too. That&#8217;s just as important as using standard Firefox or Chrome on a touchscreen is a drag without a bunch of plug-ins. And of course, Flash is fully functional, which is a clear shot across Apple&#8217;s bow.You notice a few times throughout the demo that there are a couple of different user notifications to compensate for web&#8217;s smaller buttons and higher-resolution interface. There appears to be a small water ripple effect at 1:42 when the user hits the play button for the online video and then aÂ\\xa0dramaticallyÂ\\xa0larger one at the end of the Photoshop.com demo at 3:45 when he presses and holds. These effects are not shown during the HP Home demo or NYT Air app lending to the thought that they&#8217;re a browser-only effect, designed to assist browsing.Now Adobe wouldn&#8217;t show off Windows in its demo. This was strictly an Adobe demo, but that&#8217;s fine. It answered a lot of questions about HP&#8217;s upcoming slate device. First, a full version of Windows is very much present, which is awesome. None of us wants a watered-down OS â\\x80\\x94 except for iPad buyers, of course. But the demo also shows that there will be a versatile, touch-friendly interface for most tasks and multi-touch capabilities toÂ\\xa0exploit all the potential uses.Hopefully HP, Dell and all the other mainstream tablet makers are on the same page with Adobe. They have the ability to stand up to theÂ\\xa0monstrosityÂ\\xa0that is the Apple App Store if they agree to slate standards, which will allow app developers to code one version of the their program and not worry about various screen resolutions and hardwareÂ\\xa0variations.Devin adds: This is an improvement on the smaller tablet we saw at CES. It&#8217;s about iPad-sized, which is to say a little smaller than a sheet of paper. I&#8217;m guessing an 8&#8243; screen is what they&#8217;re working with there, though who knows what the final hardware will be. I still think that shrinking Windows is a bad start for a tablet device, as much so as puffing up the iPhone in the case of the iPad. The only device that may actually hit with a truly tablet-only OS seems to be the Courier, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m genuinely excited about it. The slate race does appear to be hotting up, though, and that&#8217;s a good thing.',\n",

While I&#8217;m dubious that many of us need a portable scanner, the device is small enough to fit in a briefcase and is quite light &#8211; about 3 pounds. It is USB-powered &mdash; it requires two ports (one for power and one for data) however, which is a pain &#8211; and the top is collapsible for portability.There is one button &#8211; Scan &#8211; and that&#8217;s it. You install the software, press the button, and rock out with single- or double-sided scanning. The scanner can grab eight double-sided pages per minute and it can hold card as well as standard stock. It scans a maximum of 600DPI in color and 1,200 dpi in grayscale.Once a document is scanned Fujitsu&#8217;s ScanSnap service kicks in and asks you what you want to do &#8211; scan to file, to email, to Word, to Excel, or to CardIris, the card scanning service. This is where things get hairy.I tested the scanning features using a standard spreadsheet I made in Excel and printed twice.One I essentially ruined with a magic marker and the other I simply signed. I scanned both back in into Word and Excel.As you see, all of the text scanned perfectly, except for where I adulterated it. While it&#8217;s obvious that a ruined page won&#8217;t scan correctly, I wanted to give it a bit of a challenge.I then scanned them both into Word and Excel. The results are fairly heartening. The unadulterated version came out great in both Word and Excel and larger scanning jobs a I ran earlier also worked fine. The adulterated version &#8211; well, not so much. Obviously this is drastic example, but its food for thought if you&#8217;re planning in scanning handwritten notes. Scanned into WordScanned into ExcelBottom LineI&#8217;ve yet to become completely paper-free in my record-keeping but this would definitely be a step in the right direction. For quick jobs as well as spreadsheet and document storage this portable scanner did a more than adequate job. Product Page: Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300',\n",

But there was no indication that the partnership extended beyond that.Then a reader noticed that facebook.eventbrite.com linked to a page showing the image above (the page has since been removed). The message says:Collect money for your event with EventbriteEventbrite is partnering with Facebook to enable you to collect money for your event. Your attendees pay with credit card and Eventbrite collects the money on your behalf and sends you a check when your event is over. We charge a small service fee for every ticket sold. 5.5% + $.99c, which attendees pay, costing you nothing.Eventbrite has helped event organizers around the world sell over 10 million tickets. We&#8217;re excited to help you sell your and put some delightful cash in your pocket.Like the F8 event, this is set up on Eventbrite&#8217;s site, and it seems likely that Facebook will send users there that want to monetize events, have them log in via Facebook Connect, and finish the process.We interviewed Eventbrite founders Kevin Hartz and Julia Hartz last last year when they announced funding from Sequioia Capital. The company is growing fast and expects over $100 million in gross ticket sales this year. A Facebook partnership would add a lot of flow to the service, obviously. And even though only a small percentage of events need ticket sales, lots of them want to give out free tickets. Eventbrite does that without any fee and calls it viral marketing.When we asked Eventbrite&#8217;s Kevin Hartz about the screenshot he said Sorry, &#8220;Mike, can&#8217;t comment at this time/We never comment on deal speculation.&#8221; Facebook hasn&#8217;t yet responded to our request for comment.Update: Facebook says &#8220;We&#8217;re always testing Connect implementations with various sites and have nothing to share at this time.&#8221;CrunchBase Information',\n",

But a change in Canadian tax law last week is designed to spur U.S. venture investments in Canadian startups and make Canada less of a leper colony for tech entrepreneurs.The change allows foreign investors in most Canadian startups to avoid &#8220;literally hundreds of pages of documents&#8221; to be filed and processed on a sale of a startup, sometimes by each limited partner in a venture fund. That burden meant that most venture firms simply ignored the Canadian market, says Deloitte:A 2007 survey by Deloitte and Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity Association (CVCA) of 528 VCs from around the world found that 40% of U.S. respondents and 28% of global respondents cited Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s unfavourable tax environment as a key reason for not investing in Canadian companies. This level of concern is five times higher than for any other country in the survey and reflects the current investment crisis within Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s venture capital industry. The survey also found that Canada is attracting the attention of just 11% of U.S. VCs as a primary country for expansion â\\x80\\x94 behind China (34%) and India (24%).â\\x80\\x9cI predict that over time this farsighted tax legislation will help propel Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s extraordinary technology into global industry leadership in numerous markets, and will likely be viewed in the future as a defining moment for the Harper government in Canadian innovation,&#8221; says Stephen Hurwitz, a partner at U.S. law firm Choate Hall &amp; Stewart.That may be a bit optimistic, but the tax change is a nice start. Perhaps over time our frozen neighbors to the north will be known for being great at something more than playing hockey and eating poutine. A robust startups community would be very welcome.More information:Change in tax law sends a strong signal to international investors that Canada is â\\x80\\x9copen for businessâ\\x80\\x9dGovernment removes tax barriers and stimulates flow of capital across Canadian borderTORONTO, March 4, 2010 â\\x80\\x94 Canadian companies across the country are likely applauding todayâ\\x80\\x99s federal budget, which contains tax law changes that give them the advantage they need to compete on the global stage. By amending the definition of â\\x80\\x9ctaxable Canadian propertyâ\\x80\\x9d to exclude shares of Canadian private companies (where not more than 50% of their value is derived from real property in Canada, Canadian resource property or timber resource property), the government has significantly reduced administrative and, in some cases, economic barriers to foreign investment in Canadian-based innovation and technology. This change puts Canada at the top of the list of places to invest globally. â\\x80\\x9cThe changes in tax legislation announced in todayâ\\x80\\x99s budget are among the most significant changes to capital gains taxation since the introduction of taxation of capital gains in 1972,â\\x80\\x9d explains John Ruffolo, Global Tax Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications Leader, Deloitte. â\\x80\\x9cThe Canadian government has listened to the financing community, understood the severity of the problem and removed the major tax barriers that have prevented critically needed international investment capital from crossing our borders.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAt a minimal cost to the government, this amendment will have an immediate, positive and direct impact on Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s ability to grow a robust Canadian technology industry,â\\x80\\x9d explains Terry Matthews, Chairman, Wesley Clover. â\\x80\\x9cBy sending a clear message to international investors that Canada is â\\x80\\x9copen for businessâ\\x80\\x9d, the government will make Canadian companies more attractive to foreign investors overnight. This will help Canadian companies raise the capital they need to achieve global leadership status.â\\x80\\x9d The change means a much more welcoming environment for foreign investors. In the vast majority of cases, non-residents who were not taxable on the disposition of their investments in such shares due to Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s broad international tax treaty network, are now exempt from tax under Canadian domestic law without having to apply for treaty relief.  As a result, they are no longer required to comply with the Section 116 tax clearance certificate procedure or file a Canadian income tax return. The changes also remove what were perceived to be insurmountable barriers for many venture capitalists who considered the previous administrative requirements and economic delays for each investor to be strong deterrents to investing in Canada.  â\\x80\\x9cThe removal of the Section 116 tax barrier is a tax master stroke by the Canadian government enabling Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s emerging technology companies to access deep pools of international capital and the vast global customer markets to which those pools are connected,&#8221; notes Stephen Hurwitz, Partner, Choate Hall &amp; Stewart LLP in Boston. â\\x80\\x9cI predict that over time this farsighted tax legislation will help propel Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s extraordinary technology into global industry leadership in numerous markets, and will likely be viewed in the future as a defining moment for the Harper government in Canadian innovation.â\\x80\\x9dBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE SECTION 116 TAX BARRIERSThe following describes the tax barriers that were removed in todayâ\\x80\\x99s budget and that are no longer preventing international investment in Canada:â\\x80¢\\tWithholding and Section 116 certificate process â\\x80\\x94 The overwhelming majority of foreign VCs are not subject to Canadian tax when they sell an investment, but face a delay of many months to work through the Section 116 tax clearance process until funds can freely flow to them. Many foreign VCs are structured such that each of the investors in the VC â\\x80\\x94 sometimes hundreds or even thousands â\\x80\\x94 is subject to this clearance process as if they held the investment directly. This delay results in lower returns and frequently causes direct financial loss to investors. Canadians who invest in the United States, the United Kingdom and other major global markets do not face such taxes or delays from red tape. â\\x80¢\\tRequirement to file Canadian tax returns by foreigners who donâ\\x80\\x99t owe taxes creates hundreds of pages of unnecessary paperwork â\\x80\\x94 Canada imposed tax filing requirements in circumstances where no taxes were payable by these investors. When a foreign VC sells an investment, each investor of the foreign VC has to file a Canadian tax return even if they donâ\\x80\\x99t owe any taxes. This results in literally hundreds of pages of documents that are required for signature and processing for a single sale. This tax return filing issue also applies to certain Canadian public companies. Why Canada was perceived by VCs as having an unfavourable tax environmentA 2007 survey by Deloitte and Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity Association (CVCA) of 528 VCs from around the world found that 40% of U.S. respondents and 28% of global respondents cited Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s unfavourable tax environment as a key reason for not investing in Canadian companies. This level of concern is five times higher than for any other country in the survey and reflects the current investment crisis within Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s venture capital industry. The survey also found that Canada is attracting the attention of just 11% of U.S. VCs as a primary country for expansion â\\x80\\x94 behind China (34%) and India (24%).

Between its crazy form-factor and the hidden trackpad tucked on the back of the display, everything we took as merits at face value have devolved into novelties.Worst of all, it seems AT&#038;T has taken a page from their time with the iPhone that no one wanted them to take. Like the iPhone &#8212; but unlike any other Android handset we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; the Motorola Backflip can&#8217;t install applications from any sources beyond the official, on-handset application store.By default, all Android handsets are soft-limited to installing applications solely from Google&#8217;s Android Market. If a user tries to install an app through the browser with a brand new handset, they&#8217;ll get an error message telling them that they&#8217;ll need to flip a switch in the configuration screen before they can download from &#8220;Unknown Sources&#8221;. Alas, this switch is no where to be found on the Backflip.While it can be said that Android&#8217;s less-restrictive market should make this a non-issue, it doesn&#8217;t. Certain  applications, like the paid-version of Junefabric&#8217;s PDANet  tethering application, can only be installed through the browser. Other times, developers will want to release their applications in beta form to a limited number of users outside of the market &#8212; something which, as it stands, Backflip owners will be unable to partake in.What do you think? Knowing that AT&#038;T is trying their damnedest to play gatekeeper on Android, would you still buy a Backflip?[Thanks John R.!]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As gaming on social network grows by leaps and bounds, there&#8217;s been a proliferation of startups that are helping game developers monetize by offering virtual currency deals in conjunction with advertisers. Offerpal, gWallet,  Cherry Deals and others all partner with both developers and advertisers to offer virtual currency deals within games. Today, Boomerang Networks is entering the arena with its newly launched offer platform, Offerwall, which offers users the ability to rate and review virtual currency offers. As more users participate in clocking and buying into the deals, good offers float to the top and bad offers are kicked off the system. Users can rate each advertising offer, giving it a thumbs up or thumbs down. Based on their experience, users can also write reviews and comments, which are then visible to the game&#8217;s entire community of users. Offerwall&#8217;s algorithm that sets the order in which advertising offers are displayed, allowing popular offers to rise to the top and unpopular or poorly related offers to be eliminated all together. If the user gives a thumbs down to an advertising offer, that particular offer, as well as similar offers, are never presented to that user again. Similar to gWallet, Offerpal and others, Offerwall promises to avoid distributing spammy offers by employing a direct sales team that works with advertisers directly. Offerwall is also targeting international markets for its in-game offers and can be translated into all major languages including German, French, Italian, Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Russian. Boomerang has also built partnerships with international payments providers, tailoring payment options to the region where the deals are being offered. At launch Offerwall is being used by 50 game applications, including BarnBuddy from TheBroth and MouseHunt by HitGrab. As more players enter the virtual currency space, startups are developing innovative ways to make their offers more attractive. Offerpal recently launched Offerpal Tasks,  gWallet  just launched a new placement format for offers and Cherry Deals offers Groupon-like local deals to earn virtual currency. Offerwal&#8217;s international strategy and user-reviewed and rated format could help separate the startup from its rivals. \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

Announced last week at the American International Toy Fair, a Xachi (pronounced &#8220;ZAH-chee&#8221;) Pet is an iPhone-controlled toy. It looks kind of like a Furby with a giant LED screen in place of its face. And, yes, you interface with your Xachi Pet through your iPhone/iPod.It&#8217;s pretty a simple concept, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen someone pull it off. The closest thing to an iPhone-enabled toy on the market is a helicopter with your iPhone as a remote control, and that&#8217;s not exactly cute and cuddly.The Xachi Pet is produced by Taptic Toys, and is not yet in production. They expect it to cost $40 or less. It&#8217;s got an 8-bit speaker, an accelerometer, robotic legs that can dance, and a LED screen for animation. Similar to a Tomagachi, you track and maintain its hunger, thirst, health, and happiness from your iPod/iPhone &#8211; you can feed it, give it water and play with it to keep it happy.You can also play games with your Xachi Pet. I got to try out a few and found them to be enjoyable, and I can see a youngster absolutely loving this thing. There&#8217;s a game where you use your iPhone as a bubble blaster and try to burst the bubbles on the Xachi Pet&#8217;s screen. Another game lets you control the Xachi Pet so it dances to the tune of a track on your phone. There are learning games (like simple math or spelling games), and the possibilities go on.Three of Taptic Toys&#8217; four founders met at Battle Bots, a brutal competition where teams create robots that try to massacre each other in an enclosed arena. Yes, this is the same Battle Bots you watched with glee on Comedy Central 10 years ago.Is there a market full of kids with iPod Touches? According to Admob&#8217;s report, over 65% of iPod Touch owners are 17 and under &#8212; so there just might be. I don&#8217;t know jack about what kids like to do these days, but my inclination is that Xachi Pets has a lot going for it. It looks like a Furby, feels like a stuffed animal, and has the added cool factor of being iPod Touch-friendly. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how kids take to it, but for now, let us know what you think in the comments section.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Tokyo-based jig.jp has been developing mobile browsers since 2003, claiming its &#8220;jig browser (which was downloaded over 4 million times so far) is the worldâ\\x80\\x99s first Java-based browser that made it possible to view PC sites on cell phones. And now the company has released an ambitious Android app called SPIDERSS, which combines a browser with an RSS reader and an aggregator for social network updates.Available in English and Japanese, the free app&#8217;s main selling point is that all elements are accessible from a single screen: You can either choose to directly type in a URL or search term in the top bar (to then open a full browser window), check your Facebook newsfeed and Twitter timeline in the &#8220;Application Deck&#8221; under that or scroll through your RSS feeds in the bottom part. All feeds and web pages can be easily shared by SMS, Email, Twitter or Facebook with the push of a button.The Webkit-based browser supports HTML 4.0.1/XHTML 1.1 and JavaScript 1.5, provides native support for the VGA and QVGA resolutions and can be used with Android OS 1.5 or higher (full specs). Feed formats supported include RSS (0.9, 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0) and ATOM (0.3 and 1.0). Users can bookmark pages, use tabs, choose between four different search engines, keep a record of links visited etc.The browser is pretty hard to use though, as it &#8220;magnifies&#8221; websites, displaying the top left part first (skip to 1.00 in the video below to see what I mean). SPIDERSS does offer different layouts and a zoom-out function (50% maximum), but still, most of the times you need to scroll in various directions to view a website in its entirety.    But SPIDERSS is still in beta, with jig.jp saying future updates will bring a better overall browsing experience and additional functions (versions for Nokia (Ovi) and Windows phones are scheduled for release in the near future). The app is free, so take it for a spin if you&#8217;re not satisfied with your current Android browser.Other Android browsers available or currently in development include Opera Mini, Steel, Dolphin, Firefox Mobile and Skyfire.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'To many in the industry, Techmeme is hands down the best aggregator of technology news. So it makes sense that they&#8217;d try to take their combination of algorithms and editors to other verticals. But they&#8217;ve tried in the past, and it hasn&#8217;t worked. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re giving up.Today, the people behind Techmeme are rolling out Mediagazer, a new site focused on aggregating and serving up all the best media news from around the web. The timing seems perfect given the level of interest surrounding the slow but interesting death of print media. And the interest around exciting new devices like the iPad, which may or may not reinvigorate the industry.But why chose to focus on media?&#8220;Media news has several things going for it:Â\\xa0lots of new coverage every day,Â\\xa0lots of interlinking,Â\\xa0a variety of subtopics (video, blogs, journalism, newspapers, etc.)Â\\xa0and (we hope) a potential audience withÂ\\xa0interest in several of those subtopics,&#8221; Techmeme founder Gabe Rivera tells us.Rivera has tried in the past to roll the Techmeme idea to other verticals such as celebrity news (WeSmirch), political news (Memeorandum), and even baseball news (Ballbug). All those sites still exist, but none have gotten the level of interest that Techmeme has.So why will this be different?Â\\xa0Aside from the interest in media, this is the first site Rivera has rolled out since switching over to using human editor curation. And actually, Mediagazer will be launched under the control of Megan McCarthy, the first human editor Rivera hired in late 2008. Rivera has since made other hires to round out a full staff that can work around the clock for Techmeme.Says McCarthy, &#8220;Media is tumultuous. Some areas are growing, some shrinking, and there&#8217;s no clear path of where things are going. There&#8217;s talk about the future of journalism, consolidation of media ownership, bloggers, Twitter, etc. It affects daily life (look at how the Oscars were blacked out in New York City and how many people were touched by that). This is an industry that is filled with such disruption &#8212; you need to have a way to clearly view the big picture. Mediagazer does that.&#8220;And a bit more about how it actually works from Mediagazer&#8217;s about area:We gather all the important stories about media and present them to you in a timely, thorough, and organized manner. Our story selection method uses the power of our freakishly smart algorithm combined with direct editorial input from knowledgeable human editors.We collect every relevant take on an issue and package them together in a comprehensive group of links. That way, you not only get the lead opinion on an issue, but you can easily see all the supporting, opposing, smart, controversial, notable, and previously unseen viewpoints.

       "  'comments_content': 'First launched back in April 2009, TweetPhoto has been steadily building out its service with  multiple useful features, including Foursquare integration and aÂ\\xa0partnership with Kodak. Today, the site is getting a huge overhaul with more social features and a new iPhone app.TweetPhoto has now added the ability to sign in with Twitter OAuth, Facebook Connect, MySpace OAuth and Foursquare OAuth so that a user of any one of these social networks can use TweetPhoto as a stand alone photo sharing service. The site will also be rolling out  LinkedIn support in the next few weeks. In addition to login capabilities across all four of these services, TweetPhoto users can also link these social networking accounts together. Once you link your Facebook, Twitter, MySpace , or Foursquare accounts on the site, your photos uploaded to TweetPhoto can be simultaneously broadcast to all of the networks. Third party applications that use TweetPhoto as the default photo uploader such as TweetDeck and Seesmic&#8217;s BlackBerry app, will also include this functionality.TweetPhoto&#8217;s new, free iPhone app, called TweetPhoto Pro, is a suped-up version of its sister iPhone apps. The app allows users to upload photos, see their friends photos, the public photo stream, popular photos (usually celebrities or breaking news), and can link their social network accounts. The startup has also submitted similar apps for Android and Blackberry platforms.In connection with the new social broadcast features, TweetPhoto is rolling out a new API to include over 35 new API calls. And as we wrote last year, TweetPhoto got into a bit of a pickle over its logo. That combined with Twitter&#8217;s trademark of the word &#8220;Tweet,&#8221; is resulting in TweetPhoto completely rebranding its service. The first step of this effort is a new logo, which we&#8217;ve attached above. A new name is forthcoming, says TweetPhoto, and its focus will be much more on the mobile side of things.While TweetPhoto is still not getting the same amount of traffic as the leaders in the space, TwitPic, the site is edging out fellow competitor yFrog, according to January&#8217;s Compete numbers.  But as TweetPhoto, which met with a little bit of scandal last fall, makes its offerings more social and interactive, the site could even give TwitPic a run for its money.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Mochi Social allow developers to build social features into their games such as inviting friends, sending gifts, or posting to an activity stream. Mochi Social allows for the ability to broadcast in-game notifications to deliver news about game updates, friend activity or challenges.The aim of incorporating these features, allows for a game to transcend one social network by plugging into users social graph across all of their social media identities.  The platform currently integrates with Facebook, MySpace and Twitter with more sites to be added in the near future.  Currently in private beta, Mochi Social will be rolling out its first enabled game â\\x80\\x9cKingdoms at Warâ\\x80\\x9d by A Thinking Ape next week. A joint effort between Mochi Media and parent company Shanda Games, Mochi GAME Developer Fund is a $10 million fund that will help promising Flash and social game developers support their games through sponsorship, licensing and publishing deals. The fund will be used to assist indie Flash game development studios and game developers. Participating developers will gain access to technical, design and testing resources from Shanda Games, as well as development tools and distribution to nearly 40,000 websites from Mochi Media. Initial investments will be as much as $100,000 per game title. It&#8217;s nice to see Mochi using its backing from Shanda to good use. And the addition of social features to Mochi&#8217;s development platform will no doubt be useful to game developers. As of June 2009 100 million people were playing games that included Mochi Media. The company also launched a payments platform for game developers last year.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Online retail sales aren&#8217;t growing at the torrid pace they once were, but they continue to grow steadily.  Forrester Research put out a new five-year forecast today predicting that e-commerce sales in the U.S. will keep growing at a 10 percent compound annual growth rate through 2014.  It forecasts online retail sales in the U.S. will be nearly $250 billion, up from $155 billion in 2009.   Last year, online retail sales were up 11 percent, compared to 2.5 percent for all retail sales.In Western Europe, Forrester expects a slightly faster 11 percent growth rate for online retail sales, going from $93 billion (68 billion Euros) in 2009 to $156 billion (114.5 billion Euros) in 2014.  Forrester&#8217;s estimates exclude online sales of autos, travel, and prescription drugs.Some other stats from the U.S. forecast:e-commerce sales will represent 8 percent of all retail sales in the U.S. by 2014, up from 6 percent in 2009In 2009, 154 million people in the U.S. bought something online, or 67 percent of the online population (4 percent more than in 2008)Three product categories (computers, apparel, and consumer electronics) represented more than 44 percent of online sales($67.6 billion) Â\\xa0in 2009While $155 billion worth of consumer goods were bought online last year, a far larger portion of offline sales were influenced by online research.  Forrester estimates that $917 billion worth of retail sales last year were &#8220;Web-influenced.&#8221;  It also estimates that online and Web-influenced offline sales combined accounted for 42 percent of total retail sales and that percentage will grow to 53 percent by 2014, when the Web will be influencing $1.4 billion worth of in-store sales.  Yet there is a lot of room for improvement in helping consumers go from doing online research to in-store purchases.  Only 61 percent of consumers who cross over from one to the other are satisfied with their buying experience, compared to 82 percent for those who end up buying online.  Forrester draws the lesson that retailers need to do a better job appealing to online consumers in their physical stores.  I come to a different conclusion: avoid going to real stores and buy online whenever you can.  You will be happier.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Brazil is sort of a strange country to throw into the â\\x80\\x9cemerging marketâ\\x80\\x9d category. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a particularly young country like India or Israel, nor is it a country like China or Russia that embraced capitalism fairly recently. Brazil is as old as the US and has had a decently built out infrastructure of things like roads and phone lines for some time.Yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s a growing country with a young and stabilizing democracy that has a long way to go in terms of technology, modernization and bridging a quality of life between very wealthy and very poor. In that sense, it shares enough in common with emerging markets that Wall Street, at least, tosses it in the â\\x80\\x9cBRICâ\\x80\\x9d bucket. Indeed, Wall Street has had a way bigger crush on Brazil to date than Silicon Valley.That seems to have had two effects on the startup scene in Sao Paulo. The first is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good deal of innovation in the finance space. Banks in Brazil had to become advanced, many people told me, because of the runaway inflation that plagued the country for so many years. As opposed to other huge markets like Mexico, China or India that lagged in the adoption of checking accounts and other basic services, in Brazil you had to have your money in the bank, because the value of cash changed so rapidly.Â\\xa0 So itâ\\x80\\x99s no surprise more of those thereâ\\x80\\x99s-a-better-way spin-offs have come in finance than, say, Web 2.0 or mobile. (Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a ton in agriculture and other sectors outside the cities too, but more on that in a future post.)My favorite finance company that I met during my February trip to Brazil is called Crivo, and it left me wondering if that great wave of finance innovation might come from our Southern neighbors, not us.Crivo has developed a way to do lightning-fast, three-second credit checks. Its servers pull information from a variety of sources, including all the places you&#8217;d expect but but also sources like utility records to verify an applicant&#8217;s address or ensuring that their phone number doesn&#8217;t just go to a payphone. â\\x80\\x9cEven a single piece of information can be useful in detecting fraud,â\\x80\\x9d says Daniel Turnini, one of Crivoâ\\x80\\x99s founders. (Pictured above, on the right, with his co-founders.)Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing like a FICO score in Brazil so, in the past, credit decisions were made based on negative data and positive data. In other words you are â\\x80\\x9cgoodâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cbadâ\\x80\\x9d in the bankâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s little record for positive data in Brazil, because the wealthiest people donâ\\x80\\x99t want how much they paid for a house or a car in public records. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a security issue, Turnini says. That only leaves negative data.So if thereâ\\x80\\x99s no information about you, itâ\\x80\\x99s assumed youâ\\x80\\x99re a good credit risk. But miss one payment and you have a â\\x80\\x9cdirty name,â\\x80\\x9d Turini says. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a flawed system. Many good credit risks (indeed Iâ\\x80\\x99d bet most people) have missed a payment before, and itâ\\x80\\x99s a huge assumption to make that someone with no credit history would be a good borrower. In recent years there have been banks, insurance companies, and similar institutions vying to cash in on Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s emerging middle class and increasingly wealthy upper classes, but had no real way of knowing how to extend credit.Sound like great timing? It would have been if Crivo wasnâ\\x80\\x99t started in 1998. Back then, few banks in the US would have been early adopters of something like this, let alone banks in Brazil. (Ok, most banks in the US still wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be.) Nailing that first customer was near impossible. The founders kept thinking they were on the right track because potential customers would freak out when they saw how quickly the software worked, but they&#8217;d never quite pull the trigger on a purchase. Always hoping things would finally click the next year, the founders kept bootstrapping the company. Finally, it did. Toyotaâ\\x80\\x99s Brazilian financial arm bought their software and used it to rapidly approve people for loans, beating other car makers who were flooding into the growing market. The company has been on a sharp growth rate for five years now. They did roughly $12 million in revenues last year, and expect that to double in 2010, Turini says. Crivo says it has more than 80 employees and 100 customers today.There are clear ripple effects if Crivo does well. More people getting credit cards helps grow spending and ecommerce, more small businesses can get loans, and more people who canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to pay in cash can buy houses &#8211; to name just a few advantages. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen the benefits of â\\x80\\x9cgreenfield marketsâ\\x80\\x9d when it comes to innovation in telecom and even physical infrastructure, like roads and trains. Might Brazil be able to come up with some greenfield solutions for finance? Itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to see how a FICO score could be improved on and, ahem, really easy to make the argument that way too much credit has been extended in the US in the last ten years. But while we have a system in place, who is going to upend the apple cart and force widespread-adoption of a newer, smarter system? Itâ\\x80\\x99s South Korea and telecom all over again.And thereâ\\x80\\x99s another benefit to an emerging market that plays host to lots of finance and consulting multinationals. While countries like Israel and India have gotten a raft of talented coders thanks to US outsourcing, their own startups struggle when it comes to finding locals with sales and management expertise. Those jobs are usually kept in the US or done by transplanted Americans.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In the wake of Apple&#8217;s sudden decision to remove nearly all &#8220;sexy&#8221; applications from the App Store, we&#8217;ve been hearing that the company is also clamping down on so-called &#8220;cookie-cutter&#8221; applications â\\x80\\x94 iPhone apps that are built from templates using one of the many app-building services available.  This would be yet another major change for the App Store, as it already features thousands of such applications.  And, perhaps more important, quite a few companies have sprung up to facilitate building iPhone applications.  I&#8217;ve reached out to Apple to ask if they&#8217;d like to clarify their stance, but given their lack of transparency in the past, I&#8217;m not betting on getting anything definitive.  To try to get to the bottom of the current situation, I spoke with multiple developers (some of whom wished to remain anonymous) to find out what Apple was telling them.Between the developers I spoke to, the consensus was this: Apple doesn&#8217;t appear to be opposed to &#8216;app generators&#8217; and templates per se, but in the last month or so it has started cracking down on basic applications that are little more than RSS feeds or glorified business cards.  In short, Apple doesn&#8217;t want people using native applications for things that a basic web app could accomplish. For some of these services that&#8217;s bad news, because that&#8217;s exactly the sort of application they produce; any new applications they submit are going to get rejected. But all hope isn&#8217;t lost for them, provided they can make their apps more useful.Unlike the &#8217;sexy&#8217; app ban that took place a few weeks ago, when Apple gave developers no options to keep their apps on the store, over the last month the company has been reaching out to at least a few app building services to suggest what they should be doing.The founders of Appmakr, which has been used by publications like The Atlantic to build iPhone applications, say that the process has been quite positive (though they are quick to clarify that applications built with their tools are more full-featured than the basic RSS apps described above).  After some suggestions from Apple, the service is integrating new features like in-app purchases, instant notifications, offline access, and landscape viewing modes to their app templates.  Another developer mentioned that they might include a tip calculator for restaurant apps.  Appmakr&#8217;s hope (and one that I&#8217;m sure is shared by other developers) is that applications generated using their tools will eventually be given an accelerated path through the App Store&#8217;s approval process, because Apple is familiar and happy with the kind of apps they produce.However, from what I&#8217;ve gathered not everyone is having as much luck as the Appmakr team. Multiple developers mentioned that they&#8217;d heard of some app vendors that Apple wasn&#8217;t being nearly as accommodating towards â\\x80\\x94 I suspect services offering the most basic templates are getting hit hardest.  That said, the developers I spoke to said that they&#8217;d only heard about Apple blocking newly submitted applications, and that there wasn&#8217;t an indication that Apple is going back and removing all of the overly-basic apps they can find.So why is Apple doing this? Here&#8217;s what Medialets CEO Eric Litman had to say, which I think perfectly summarizes the situation.This is the ongoing balance point between encouraging innovation and growth on one side and wanting to tightly control user experience on the other. Apple wants iPhone apps to be superior to Web experiences because they are extremely sticky and drive people specifically to buy the iPhone over competing smartphone platforms. Apps that are too simple or largely indistinguishable from the Web, other apps or particularly other apps on other platforms send the message to end users that the iPhone app ecosystem might not be particularly special.Now the challenge for Apple is that the app building platforms are extremely attractive to a wide swath of the market that would otherwise be reluctant to bear the cost and complexity of developing an app from scratch. We have already seen apps from personal bloggers up to major media brands using some of these platforms, and many of the folks in that spectrum have content Apple would certainly want in the App Store. Interestingly, some of those same developers also have fully custom-built apps in the App Store, too.So what are the platforms to do about the recent crackdown from Apple? There&#8217;s really only one choice if they want to continue to exist on the iPhone: invest in building out considerably more flexibility into their platforms to allow each app to differ from the others they build. Integrate more features and take the time to nail the design and UI elements to be representative of what Apple wants to see in every app.For better or worse, Apple will be looking more closely at apps from the platforms than from individual developers. AppLoop, the first startup to announce and iPhone-specific app builder, is already gone. Others will almost certainly follow.Overall, this will almost certainly result in a better experience for users as they have to deal with fewer spammy apps. But, as I wrote when Apple launched its war on sex apps last month, the policy change may also scare developers.  After effectively sending a message to developers that basic applications were okay, Apple is again changing its mind. Â\\xa0Some developers may be hesitant to build their businesses around the iPhone, knowing that at any moment Apple could have a change of heart and cut off their only mode of distribution.Thanks to Robert Strojan for the tipPhoto by GoosmurfCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As has been made abundantly clear to me over the past two weeks, just about every location-based service is planning big things for the SXSW festival, which starts later this week in Austin, Texas. A few of the players have already started rolling out small changes, such as aesthetic upgrades. But a new, subtle update by Foursquare may have much larger implications.As we noted last week, Foursquare has begun revamping the &#8220;history&#8221; area of its website. This is likely part of the larger goal to completely revamp the website itself (which isn&#8217;t very useful right now), and this data also ties in to the new Foursquare iPhone app set to launch later this week. But another update makes the history area show not only where you checked-in, and the category of the venue, but also who you checked-in with.Basically, Foursquare has just turned on a new layer to your location history data. And this layer is very interesting because it goes back in time to show you who you were with at a certain venue when you were there.Now, to be clear, it only shows you the friends you were with â\\x80\\x94 not all Foursquare users. (But this means that they have that data as well.) Still, this data paints a clearer picture around your location history and potentially enrichesÂ\\xa0your social graph. It&#8217;s one thing to say you&#8217;re &#8220;friends&#8221; with someone on a social network, but another to have checked-in to the same venue at the same time over and over again. Either you&#8217;re torturing yourself, or you really are good friends with that person.This is a huge part of location asÂ\\xa0the bridge between social networking and actual social activity.Foursquare has highlighted similar data for a while on the stats page, showing you who you check-in with most often. But this new history data takes that to the next level.Â\\xa0And while the data right now only seems to go back to last December or so, Foursquare plans to implement it all the way back to 2003 â\\x80\\x94 yes, 2003.That&#8217;s because before Foursquare, co-founder Dennis Crowley ran a similar service called Dodgeball, which Google bought in 2006, and deadpooled last year. But users were able to import their old Dodgeball data before it went under, so Crowley now hopes to build a full location history social graph going back that far for long-time users.&#8220;We gotta backfill some of the data (easy, but for those who imported their Dodgeball history before Google took the site down, we can give you a good idea of the trends around who you&#8217;ve been hanging out w/ going back to 2003.) It&#8217;s awesome awesome awesome,&#8221; Crowley writes in an email to us.Something else Crowley is excited about is the potential for the visualization of this data. While this location history + friends isn&#8217;t yet in the API, it definitely will be, he notes. Depending on how that data is shared, that may raise some privacy issues, but Foursquare has made it clear that they&#8217;re well aware and very serious about the issues surrounding the sharing of location data.Even on the most basic level, this new layer of location history data should be interesting to people. It&#8217;s great to look back and see not only where you were on a certain date, but who you were there with. That&#8217;s what social data is all about.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Rather, before the days of Sirius XM and DirecTV, there was no more of a way to charge for freely accessible radio waves than there was to charge for air or sunshine.  Making content free, and charging for advertising interspersed in that free content, was pretty much the ONLY business model back then.And it worked pretty well, because supply (advertising â\\x80\\x9cunitsâ\\x80\\x9d) was limited by the amount of content produced and, more importantly, by the narrow â\\x80\\x9cchannelsâ\\x80\\x9d where such content was made available.  With such low supply, high demand, and massive reach, it was easy to reach large swaths of the populace.  The advertisers couldnâ\\x80\\x99t really quantify their results, but they came up with a wide variety of methods to attempt to do so.  Market research firms such as ACNielsen flourished to fill the need for â\\x80\\x9cmetrics.â\\x80\\x9dBut, as I argued in my last piece, brand advertising doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really work â\\x80\\x93 or, perhaps better put, is superseded by â\\x80\\x9ctransactional advertising.â\\x80\\x9dThe old logic went like this &#8212; people were more likely to buy Coca-Cola versus Carbonated Dark-Colored Sugar Water X because Coca-Cola had a brand (which Coca-Cola has spent billions on).  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the value of Coca-Colaâ\\x80\\x99s brand?  Pure math â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s the Net Present Value (NPV) of the difference that consumers will pay for Coca-Cola versus, say, RC Cola, for the lifetime of the consumer and duration of the brand.  When you pay $1 for a Coke versus $.50 for an RC Cola, the $.50 difference is chalked up to the â\\x80\\x9cbrand.â\\x80\\x9d (Yes, perhaps there are differences in taste, too â\\x80\\x93 but even with an identical formula and taste, I would argue RC Cola wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t sell as well as Coke).  Multiply $.50 times billions upon billions of cans of Coke, and you see the power of brand.I donâ\\x80\\x99t disagree with this notion, but I would argue that it is becoming largely irrelevant for a large class of goods and service providers (think soda or television set, not Rolex or BMW), and that the â\\x80\\x9cbrandâ\\x80\\x9d advertising money can be better spent, thereby imperiling expensively produced, freely distributed content.  To wit: what if Walmart refused to stock Coca-Cola, instead stocking just RC Cola?  Granted, Walmart stocks Coca-Cola because consumers demand it, and consumers demand it because of the brand that Coca-Cola has created, but that can easily be reversed.  If Walmart decided to stock only RC Cola and expel Coca-Cola from its shelves, this would change RC Colaâ\\x80\\x99s fortunes, and harm Coca-Cola, quite a bit.  Preferential placement of a good or service at/near the point of a transaction is something I call â\\x80\\x9ctransactional advertising,â\\x80\\x9d which I predict will expand as a category in the coming years.  Transactional advertising describes a clear food chain of brand and positioning; the titans at the top are Google, Amazon, Walmart, and other â\\x80\\x9caggregatorsâ\\x80\\x9d who themselves hold considerable brand equity and/or organic traffic.  Smaller players exist in niche fields: BankRate, Shopping.com, Edmunds.com, Lending Tree, even Diapers.com have become destinations that steer consumer decisions.  These have potential to be the new â\\x80\\x9cmediaâ\\x80\\x9d companies in a transactional advertising universe, odd as that might sound.This form of transactional advertising exists today, although you might not know it.  Proctor &amp; Gamble spends great effort and expense (though it pales in comparison to their brand advertising spend) to ensure eye-level placement wherever its products are sold.  Many retailers â\\x80\\x9cchargeâ\\x80\\x9d for shelf-space, with the clear understanding that better merchandised goods have a better chance of ending up in consumersâ\\x80\\x99 shopping carts.Today you see very little in the way of transactional advertising online; rarely does one brand pop up in another brandâ\\x80\\x99s checkout experience.  Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good chance that will change in a major way in the near future.  If old media companies can figure out how to attach themselves to more transactions, they have a fighting chance of sticking it out online.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;ve always had mixed feelings about the DMCA.On the one hand, as an author, I like that it gives me a way to stop illegal copies of my work being distributed in the US, so ensuring that I can continue to make a living without having to get a proper job. On the other hand, as an occasional journalist, I hate that it can also be used by trigger-happy lawyers to prevent certain embarrassing documents entering the public domain.Thus conflicted, it was with some trepidation that I received news from the old country that Gordon Brown&#8217;s government is getting ready to enact its very own version of the DMCA. Called the Digital Economy Bill (DEB), the new statute aims &#8211; amongst other things &#8211; to halt the rising tide of intellectual property theft on the Internet. But unlike the DMCA, its reach  won&#8217;t be limited to national borders: any site anywhere in the world that&#8217;s accessible from the UK needs to obey the law or else it&#8217;s liable to find itself blocked from the entire country. I&#8217;m not kidding, this is China-level enforcement.The bill originated in the House of Lords (our second law-making chamber) where it&#8217;s being tweaked and plucked, with various clauses added and removed &#8211; before being sent to the Commons (our first chamber) for debate and a final vote. Here in a nut are the key clauses as it currently stands:Firstly, if the law passes, ISPs will be obliged to keep track of all allegations of illegal file-sharing made by copyright owners. These complaints will be used to produce an  list of &#8220;persistent offenders&#8221; (subscribers who had received more than, say, 50 complaints about them) which will be made available on request to the copyright owners. The list will be anonymised, with subscribers identified only by a reference number, but copyright owners can then apply to the British courts to subpoena the names and addresses of the subscribers involved. Copyright owners can then take legal action directly, claiming substantial damages for each violation. The government is also able to take action: demanding that ISPs cut off internet access from households identified as persistent offenders.A second &#8211; and even more controversial &#8211; clause was bolted on by members of the House of Lords in response to the claim that over 35% of copyright breaches occur not through P2P sharing, but rather through media hosts like YouTube and file locker services like Rapidshare. The new amendment will give the courts the power to demand that British ISPs block access to any site that knowingly and unlawfully hosts copyright material. That&#8217;s not just sites hosted in the UK but any site anywhere in the world. As with the DMCA, the ISP won&#8217;t be liable until they are notified of the illegal content (the &#8217;safe harbor&#8217; defence) providing they then take immediate steps to block the sites hosting them. If, however, the ISPs refuse to act, they will be liable to the full legal costs of the copyright owner. But unlike the DMCA, the amended bill contains absolutely no penalties for copyright owners who file bogus or spurious claims. The effects are about as chilling as can be: it is in the copyright owners&#8217; interests to make as many claims as they like, and in the ISP&#8217;s interests to immediately block every site they&#8217;re notified of in order to avoid potentially huge legal costs.Opponents of the bill point out that most cases will never come to court as ISPs will roll over immediately, as they frequently do under DMCA in the US. But the opponents don&#8217;t stop there. Hell, they don&#8217;t really stop anywhere. Between the amended blocking clause which could, in theory, see sites like YouTube blocked from the UK &#8211; and the potential for having one&#8217;s entire house disconnected from the web, the DEB has come in from a veritable gale of criticism, much of it vented right here in the blogosphere. Who&#8217;d have thunk it?TechCrunch&#8217;s own Devin Coldewey notes that the &#8220;persistent offenders&#8221; list won&#8217;t just affect domestic file-sharers. Internet cafes, hotels and anywhere else that offers public wi-fi access could find themselves taken offline if their customers are found to be swapping copyright files. If anything, these public access points are even more at risk as it doesn&#8217;t take many teenagers using your cafe to rack up 50 copyright violations: this despite there being no way for the establishments to police what their customers are doing online. As Boing Boing&#8217;s Cory Doctorow put it, almost entirely without hyperbole, &#8220;UK Digital Economy Bill will wipe out indie WiFi hotspots in libraries, unis, cafes&#8220;In fact Doctorow is one of the bill&#8217;s harshest critics, writing numerous posts about its dangers. Not only is he vehemently opposed to the persistent offenders clause but he also rails against the site-blocking amendment, arguing that it will essentially ban file lockers from the UK, even when much of the content hosted on them is perfectly lawful. In response to Doctorow and his ilk, thousands of UK web users have signed petitions opposing the bill. Even members of parliament have come out to publicly attack the proposed measures &#8211; as Tom Watson MP told me on Twitter: &#8220;Enshrining net filtering at ISP level scares me half to death&#8230;. Law has to have a starting point. This isn&#8217;t it. Copyright reform for the internet age should be Step One. Rip it up. Start again.&#8221;A clusterfuck, then. A total shit show, even more draconian than the DMCA and even more packed to the gills with chilling effects. There&#8217;s an election coming up in the UK and the government is apparently anxious that the law be pushed through before then, but to do so would be a travesty &#8211; instead the bill should be scrapped and revisited in the next parliament.Or at least that was my first thought. Then I actually read the bill.And, you know what, it&#8217;s actually not that bad.For a start, the first point of contention &#8211; the compilation of a persistent offenders list, and the potential banning of them from accessing the Internet &#8211; isn&#8217;t quite as unfair as it sounds. Despite Doctorow&#8217;s claim that &#8220;your entire family [can] be cut off from the net if anyone who lives in your house is accused of copyright infringement, without proof or evidence or trial&#8221;, there are actually multiple points at which evidence comes into play, and the accused file-swapper is given a chance to defend themselves. The bill requires the creation of an independent tribunal body to hear claims of unfairness arising from the new laws, and alleged infringers have not one but two rights of appeal to the tribunal. With each alleged breach, the new law demands that the ISP send a letter to the subscriber putting the allegations and the evidence to them.Only once a significant number ofÂ\\xa0 breaches have been alledged (the drafters of the bill suggest 50) will the subscriber be added to the persistent offenders list. Again, they will be notified. Only at this point can the copyright owner appeal to the court &#8211; using a law that has been around for 36 years &#8211; to get the name and address of the offender. Even then, though, they won&#8217;t be taken to court. Instead, the copyright owner has to send the subscriber yet another letter (this will be their 52nd) warning them that legal action is imminent if they don&#8217;t stop. It&#8217;s only then that legal action will be taken, leading to a possible fine and &#8211; only at the extreme end of the scale &#8211; their Internet access being disconnected.The second point of contention &#8211; the blocking of file-sharing sites &#8211; is still pretty bad, but again it&#8217;s not quite what some commentators [*cough* Cory *cough*] suggest with headlines like &#8220;Lords seek to ban web-lockers (YouSendIt, etc) in the UK&#8220;. Yes, the courts will have the power to require ISPs to block sites that egregiously host copyrighted files. But they can only do so if the site involved has refused to remove the copyrighted files &#8211; a last resort against foreign file lockers who ignore British court injunctions. More importantly it&#8217;s also a power that the British courts have had since the 2002 E-Commerce Directive Regulations (with ISP&#8217;s being similarly liable for inaction): the new legislation simply creates a DMCA-style process for making take-down requests easier to issue.After several hours of reading &#8211; not just the proposed new law but also all of the existing copyright law, plus the current World Intellectual Property Organisation Treaty (the UK is a signatory) and also hundreds of pages of discussion around all of the above &#8211; a few things became clear&#8230;For one thing, many of those opposing the bill don&#8217;t seem to be opposed to the bill itself so much as they&#8217;re opposed to the entire notion of copyright law, particularly when it&#8217;s used by &#8220;greedy record companies&#8221; or &#8220;rich recording artists&#8221;. As one commenter put it on the Guardian: &#8220;If you want to be solely a &#8216;recording artist&#8217; and find you&#8217;ve been caught short &#8211; tough. No one owes you a living. You&#8217;ve been rendered obsolete by technology (not me) and you either adapt or fade away like so many other industries.&#8221; The only copyright law that people like that will accept is one that lets them steal whatever they like.Far be it from me to suggest that Cory Doctorow has an anti-copyright agenda, but there&#8217;s no doubt he&#8217;s the world&#8217;s leading proponent of the &#8216;give everything away free and reap the tangential rewards&#8217; model of intellectual property protection. Creative Commons might work perfectly for a man who makes his living writing and speaking about how he gives things away free, but it&#8217;s not always the answer for musicians, authors and filmmakers who don&#8217;t have that particular sideline. And I say that as an author who just gave his last book away under a Creative Commons license and who isn&#8217;t going to go broke any time soon.Whatever Doctorow&#8217;s biases, headlines like &#8220;UK Digital Economy Bill will wipe out indie WiFi hotspots in libraries, unis, cafes&#8221; or &#8220;Leaked UK government plan to create &#8216;Pirate Finder General&#8217; with power to appoint militias, create laws&#8221; do nothing to encourage rational debate. In fact, they&#8217;re curiously reminiscent of &#8220;Obamacare will kill grandma&#8221; claims from Republicans in the US. Why debate facts when you can drive people to your way of thinking through scary headlines?And yet, shrill objections aside, it&#8217;s equally clear that the Digital Economy Bill has its fair share of potential problems. There&#8217;s not a huge amount of new law in the bill, but there are a whole bunch of new processes &#8211; new takedown notices, persistent offender lists etc &#8211; all of which will need to work properly from day one. In the British government&#8217;s haste to rush it through before the upcoming election, there&#8217;s a huge risk of passing a bad statute which will prove impossible to enforce.Most clear of all though is that, beyond a general call to &#8220;scrap the bill and start again&#8221; (again: paging the Republicans), none of the opponents of the bill are suggesting a credible alternative. For all of our fears of &#8220;chilling effects&#8221; the fact is that the Internet is shitting all over the intellectual property rights of the UK creative industries (industries which account for 7.9% of the nation&#8217;s GDP). Existing law offers almost all of the protections required by copyright owners, but it&#8217;s too slow and costly to enforce in the face of widespread online infringement. A shake-up of the enforcement process is much needed &#8211; not just to protect fat cat record companies, but also to ensure the livelihoods of thousands of musicians, authors, filmmakers, photographers, artists and the rest who contribute to our cultural landscape. To those people, the effects of an online copyright free-for-all are just as chilling. If the DEB isn&#8217;t the right bill , then it is beholden on those attacking it to suggest an alternative.Here&#8217;s mine:1) My parents run a business that offers free wi-fi to their customers. I know it&#8217;s impossible for them to act as copyright police and so, alarmed by the proposed bill, they&#8217;ll likely choose to close down their wi-fi hotspots. To avoid that, the law needs to distinguish between domestic and business internet users when it comes to the persistent infringers clause. For domestic users, the 50-strikes and you&#8217;re out clause &#8211; and the disconnection threat &#8211; should stand: it&#8217;s a powerful deterrent, and there are plenty of points at which householders can appeal. For businesses and public wi-fi providers, the disconnection threat should be dropped entirely &#8211; it&#8217;s clearly a disproportionate punishment &#8211; but the fine should remain. In both cases, though, the burden should rest on the copyright owner to prove complicity in the infringement. Domestically, this is as simple as proving multiple breaches from the same IP address &#8211; there is a duty on the homeowner to lock down their wi-fi and to know what is happening under their roof, especially after receiving multiple notifications. For businesses, though, the copyright owner should face the (almost impossible) task of showing that the business owner is knowingly permitting copyright breaches on their premises. They&#8217;ll basically have to send private detectives round and catch the owner in the act &#8211; something only worth doing in extreme cases.2) The current site-blocking amendment should be dropped entirely. Instead it should be replaced with a virtual carbon copy (quelle irony) of the DMCA&#8217;s takedown procedures, but with even more severe punishments for copyright owners who file spurious claims. If an alleged infringer files a counter-notice but the copyright owner decides not to then pursue legal action, the former should be immediately entitled to claim damages against the latter, set at a fixed amount (say Â£250 &#8211; a little under $400) for every day each affected file was offline. In the case of entire sites being blocked, these damages could be enormous. The result: copyright owners will have a costly disincentive against filing spurious claims.3) Finally, and most importantly, the bill should be abandoned until the next parliament. Rushing through legislation is almost never a good idea &#8211; and it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s going to be a vote winner, either for this government or the next one. With the full lobbying force of the creative industries behind a new law, there&#8217;s virtually no chance that it won&#8217;t be passed in the next twelve months so MPs should take the next few months to revise it, to consult with experts, to explain it to critics and generally to ensure that everything that can be done to make it fair has been done.The UK&#8217;s creative industries generate Â£112.5 billion in revenue for the British economy. The Digital Economy Bill should be passed, and it should be passed soon. But more than all of that, it should be passed right.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier this week, we reported on a number of new security enhancements that we expect Gmail to launch in the next few days, including oAuth support.  It looks like we were right: a small startup called Etacts, whichÂ\\xa0launched last month, has just implemented oAuth for Gmail IMAP accounts, allowing Etacts to securely tap into your email without the security risks associated with handing over your Gmail password.  This appears to be the first public implementation of Gmail IMAPÂ\\xa0oAuth support. For email services, this is a big deal. Â\\xa0We expect Google to announce support for the new feature more broadly this week.So why does this matter?Â\\xa0Etacts isÂ\\xa0a powerful tool for making sure you keep in touch with the friends, family, and business associates that are important to you. But at launch, it came with one significant flaw: it required users to hand over their Gmail account passwords (without them, the service wouldn&#8217;t be able to automatically pull in your new email).  Even though Etacts seems trustworthy, handing over a password carries risks â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0if the service was ever hacked, there&#8217;s a small chance your password could have been compromised.  With oAuth, this isn&#8217;t an issue.Now instead of entering your password, Etacts redirects you to a special Google site, where you can elect to grant Etacts access to your account information (you can revoke this permission at any time). Â\\xa0Etacts still stores your email header information, which contains the subject, timestamp, and recipients of each message, but most people probably won&#8217;t have an issue with that.Now, oAuth isn&#8217;t a magic bullet for securityÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0if you give a malevolent service access to your Gmail account, they can sift through your email.  What they won&#8217;t be able to do, though, is access any of your other Google services (Calendar, Google Checkout, etc).  And they won&#8217;t have your password stored anywhere, so in the event that their servers get hacked, you won&#8217;t have to worry about your password being compromised.It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Google offers oAuth access to some of its other services, like Calendar and Contacts, but this is the first time they&#8217;ve offered it for email.

       "  'comments_content': 'There was recently a little skirmish on the web regarding the question of whether or not Microsoft has stopped innovating &mdash; whether the internal corporate culture there has thwarted new ideas, and so on. Well, I think we can all agree that Microsoft hasn&#8217;t exactly been an innovation machine in recent years; although, with as little currency as the word &#8220;innovation&#8221; has these days, that&#8217;s not saying much &mdash; but the fact is that its products haven&#8217;t shown as much ingenuity as its competitors in nearly every arena. And like a dragon guarding its hoard, it has striven primarily to maintain its stranglehold on enterprise, which makes up the vast majority of Microsoft&#8217;s treasure intake. Who can blame them? You wouldn&#8217;t give up a goose that laid golden eggs either. But the the goose is getting old, and people are getting tired of eggs. What&#8217;s the next step?Gates once famously said his greatest fear was &#8220;someone in a garage who is devising something completely new.&#8221; So the solution is simple: start building garages.Of course, we must be fair to Microsoft and say that they probably have as many metaphorical garages as anyone else in the world. Microsoft Research and Microsoft Labs, among many other experimental sections, employ an immense amount of people, and frequently come out with really cool stuff. The trouble is that something in the structure of Microsoft&#8217;s complex interlocking-teams method of management prevents these things from being anything other than great ideas. Look at Google. Their &#8220;release early, release often&#8221; strategy not only familiarizes people with the products, but also inures them to the &#8220;beta&#8221; process (some more than others), and lastly, allows Google to gauge the weight each project should have. It&#8217;s not a failure when something like Orkut doesn&#8217;t take off: it&#8217;s a successful risk assessment.The trouble, I feel, lies in the middle layer of the cake &mdash; as it does so often in real life (damn the jelly). The issue is that the best ideas often occur on the lowest levels, as much because those levels are highly populated as that they are the youngest and freshest, and these ideas must trickle up. That is, from what I understand of Microsoft (very little), in fact how it was designed. Good projects gain members and budget by degrees and snowball until they reach product status. The idea is that the whole process is smooth and practically automatic. And isn&#8217;t it pretty to think so? Unfortunately, when you factor in the inevitable corporate friction, you&#8217;re looking at years of development for a product which may or may not even be worthwhile. By the time the sausage is made, everyone has already moved on to quail. If there were an easy solution to this I&#8217;m sure everyone would take it, but Google&#8217;s seems to be the best approach when you&#8217;ve got a steady supply of golden eggs, as both they and Microsoft do in the form of advertising and enterprise revenue respectively.Microsoft is simply too big and too inflexible to really push truly interesting products out the door as fast as they need to. This isn&#8217;t any sort of big revelation, but it&#8217;s a problem with a solution: turn the company upside-down. Give the people with infinite power to crush and elevate projects direct access to the &#8220;garages&#8221; (or rather, give the garages access to them) and let them rule their arbitrary way. If they&#8217;re really as smart as they should be in order to hold a position of such power (no guarantee there), then you&#8217;ll nip non-starters in the bud and get millions into the market-breakers. The Microsoft method of slowly advancing employees&#8217; responsibilities has created so many middle men that there is hardly any other kind of person working there any more.The best examples for this are also the best examples of the current system failing. I&#8217;ll be honest: these are in fact my favorite pet projects of Microsoft&#8217;s and are by no means successes yet, though in my fantasy alternate universe they might have been.Item: SurfaceWhat does it tell you when an innovative and forward-looking project has had the same hardware for some four or five years, and despite getting a nod from Gates himself in 2003, took four years to reveal &mdash; and three years later it&#8217;s still completely inaccessible to consumers? Sure, it&#8217;s &#8220;not a consumer device.&#8221; Who do you think made that decision? Not the project team, who almost certainly envisioned a number of consumer applications. Someone limited the scope of the project and restricted its growth, even when the iPhone came out and vindicated the consumer concept. The aborted tablet project of the early 2000s and Surface might have been pushed together by a budget-slinger with vision, and they might have put out the iPad in 2006. Which brings us to the Courier.Item: CourierPop quiz, hot shot: the entire tech world is buzzing with the idea of a tablet device by one of your primary competitors. Someone leaks video of a project that is totally original and totally doable, and the internet goes wild (kind of). What do you do? A: shower the team with gold and see how fast they can whip out a prototype, which you can show at CES, pre-empting your competitor? or B: continue working on a boring design with a vanilla PC maker, that is in fact something no one wanted when you showed it last time. To be fair, it seems that Microsoft may have done a little bit of both. But Ballmer himself professes ignorance of the Courier project, and we still have yet to see one in the wild. This could have taken a lot of bit out of the iPad announcement.We had word yesterday that the Courier is running Tegra 2 and will implement some Zune stylings. Well, that puts it at least on a hardware par with the iPad and it fits with the increasingly Zune-reliant design of Microsoft&#8217;s handheld devices. Unified interface? Office applications? E-book functionality? Check, check, and double check &mdash; but instead they lay money on an awkward and underpowered shrink-down of Windows 7. Again, who made this decision? Some board room jockeys likely voted 7 to 4 to &#8220;emphasize existing properties.&#8221; If there was an informed and alert adjudicator with a nice big slush fund, this thing might have been hands-on at CeBit.Item: Multi-touch miceWhat can I say? Get a team of talented, creative people, refuse to settle on a design, and watch your competitor put out the exact product you were thinking of. All it would take is for someone to walk into the same room I did, get the same demo I did, and then point with his index finger. &#8220;That one.&#8221; Call up in-house prototyping and you&#8217;ve got a working model in two months. It&#8217;d break a few hearts to scrap the excess designs, but how many designs do you think Apple scrapped for the iPod? Those heartbroken designers now live in houses of solid gold. And they eat pearls for breakfast. Not an exaggeration.Item: Windows Phone 7 SeriesWhat better icon for Microsoft&#8217;s inertia than Windows Mobile? Every release has been more and more out of date, by reason that its competitors moved faster and didn&#8217;t have quite the legacy install base to worry about. When you make a big deal out of something like 6.5 years after the iPhone, and when Google is putting out Android 2.0, you might as well be selling telegraph poles. Meanwhile, slouching slowly towards release is Windows Phone 7 Series (yeah &#8211; they&#8217;ll need to change the name), which while still behind the times (and getting more so every day it&#8217;s released in Q4 2010), is a shot in the arm for Microsoft&#8217;s entire mobile division. A whole new design aesthetic! Apps! A decent media player! They knew they had a winner on their hands sometime before the launch of the Zune HD, which they rightfully called part of a new platform.Once again: whose idea was it to wait until WinMo 6 had completed its graceful conversion into a complete wreckage? Well, someone worked real hard on the 6.5 app store and Today screen, and they wouldn&#8217;t want to steal 6.5&#8217;s thunder (cough) by announcing its successor at the same. Here is where, a year and a half ago, a smart person with a free hand might have said &#8220;sorry guys, you&#8217;re polishing the knobs on the Titanic. Finish what you&#8217;re working on, then you&#8217;re going to App development for the new hotness.&#8221; No sales would have been lost, and 7 would have launched (consulting arbitrary number calculator) six months earlier. Or something.Okay, okay. I admit it. The only point I&#8217;m really making (in so many words!) is one that&#8217;s so obvious that it&#8217;s hardly worth saying: &#8220;Smart people should be giving money to promising projects and culling projects that have no future.&#8221; Any company could use more of that, and in the end this is mostly just a rant about the inertia that takes over big companies. But Microsoft has a track record of getting beaten to the punch because of a simple lack of boldness. They&#8217;re on the cutting edge and they refuse to acknowledge it.  I&#8217;m slightly ashamed to say that I am reminded of the bar scene in Swingers where Jon Favreau is assured that he has claws and just doesn&#8217;t know what to do with them.What I&#8217;m seeing, though, is that maybe Microsoft is starting to get this. The projects above were major breaks from Microsoft&#8217;s staples, but are finally getting the juice they deserve. I feel like I&#8217;m at a &#8220;mandatory innovation seminar&#8221; saying this, but taking a few serious risks is the only way Microsoft will be able to stay competitive for the rest of its dwindling lifetime. If they can put their trust (and their war chest) into the hands of a few worthy idea wranglers, they&#8217;ve got a fair chance of turning Microsoft Research into Microsoft Pile Of Money.The bad news for Microsoft is that the only products anybody is excited about are the ones most unlike what they&#8217;ve been doing for 20 years. The good news for Microsoft is that they&#8217;re making products unlike what they&#8217;ve made for 20 years, and people are excited about them. It might just be too late and every project I mentioned will be torn to shreds by Apple, Google, and the other wolves pawing at Microsoft&#8217;s door. But I think that at the final accounting, people will be able to look back and say &#8220;Well, it didn&#8217;t save them, but towards the end there, they actually started to get it.&#8221;TL;DR:',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Legend has it that when Cortes landed in Mexico in the 1500s, he ordered his men to burn the ships that had brought them there to remove the possibility of doing anything other than going forward into the unknown.  Marc Andreessen has the same advice for old media companies: &#8220;Burn the boats.&#8221;  Yesterday, Andreessen was in New York City and we met up.  We got to talking about how media companies are handling the digital disruption of the Internet when he brought up the Cortes analogy. In particular, he was talking about print media such as newspapers and magazines, and his longstanding recommendation that they should shut down their print editions and embrace the Web wholeheartedly.  &#8220;You gotta burn the boats,&#8221; he told me, &#8220;you gotta commit.&#8221;  His point is that if traditional media companies don&#8217;t burn their own boats, somebody else will.Andreessen once famously put the New York Times on deathwatch for its stubborn insistence on trying to save and prolong its legacy print business.  With all the recent excitement in media quarters recently over Apple&#8217;s upcoming iPad and other tablet computers, and their potential to create a market for paid digital versions and subscriptions of newspapers and magazines, I wondered if Andreessen still felt the same way.  Does he think the iPad will change anything?Andreessen asked me if TechCrunch is working on an iPad app or planning on putting up a paywall.  I gave him a blank stare.  He laughed and noted that none of the newer Web publications (he&#8217;s an investor in the Business Insider) are either.  &#8220;&#8221;All the new companies are not spending a nanosecond on the iPad or thinking of ways to charge for content.  The older companies, that is all they are thinking about.&#8221;But people pay for apps.  Wouldn&#8217;t he pay for a beautiful touchscreen version of a magazine?  Maybe, if it were something genuinely new that blew him away.  It would have to be more than an article with video and graphics though. (I agree, otherwise it&#8217;s no better than a CD-ROM).   Oh, and he points out, that the iPad will have a &#8220;fantastic browser.&#8221;  No matter how many iPads the Apple sells, the Web will always be the bigger market.  &#8220;There are 2 billion people on the Web,&#8221; he says.  &#8220;The iPad will be a huge success if it sells 5 million units.&#8221;  Despite trying time and again, Andreessen&#8217;s observation is that media companies have no aptitude for technology, nor do they really understand what technology companies do.  The one thing technology companies do really well is deal with constant disruption.  &#8220;Microsoft is going through this right now,&#8221; he points out, &#8220;Ballmer is not complaining about it.&#8221; He&#8217;s tackling it head on.  So did Intel when Andy Grove gutted it to shift from memory chips to microprocessors.  So does every technology company CEO. It is ingrained in the industry Andreessen comes from, so it is just obvious to him: &#8220;You are cruising along, and then technology changes.  You have to adapt.&#8221;  Media companies need to learn that lesson fast.  To the extent that their products are now delivered and consumed as digital bits, they too are becoming technology companies.Beyond the iPad, he believes that all the talk once again from big media companies about erecting paywalls or somehow charging for news, articles and video online is shortsighted at best.  He comes back to the simple fact that the open Web is where the users are.  Talking about paywalls and paid apps is like saying, &#8220;We know where the market is and we are not going to go there.&#8221;  Print newspapers and magazines will never get there, he argues, until they burn the boats and shut down their print operations.  Yes, there are still a lot of people and money in those boatsâ\\x80\\x94billions of dollars in revenue in some cases.  &#8220;At risk is 80% of revenues and headcount,&#8221; Andreessen acknowledges, &#8220;but shift happens.&#8221;  You&#8217;d have to be crazy to burn the boats.  Crazy like Cortes.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Instead it is a place where flesh-and-blood, average Joes and Janes are given leave to pass judgement on the work of others and, depending on their sugar intake, sexual activity, and general mood, arbitrarily dismiss or accept that work on a whim.

       "  'comments_content': 'My last post triggered some interesting debates in the blogosphere about whether entrepreneurs were a product of nature or could be nurtured. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not black or white. People are a product of their upbringing and education. Average humans can achieve extraordinary feats when they really try. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll concede that, like some great athletes, some great entrepreneurs may have something different about them that gives them a special advantage (this is a topic that I am presently researching). But not every entrepreneur needs to reap the same fortune as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg to qualify as a success. You can build a good lifestyle business that pays the bills, or that does good for the world, and be considered a successful entrepreneur. (And youâ\\x80\\x99ll probably be happier and gain more respect than most billionaires do.) Entrepreneurship isnâ\\x80\\x99t all about the IPO.I hold steadfast to my belief â\\x80\\x94 based on my experience in building two great technology companies and in mentoring around 200 entrepreneurs over some years and on what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned from my academic research into the background and motivations of entrepreneurs â\\x80\\x94 that entrepreneurs can be made. People born into entrepreneurial families may have the advantage of knowing the ups and downs of business, and, all else being equal, people from entrepreneurial families are certainly more likely to become entrepreneurs than others are. But the skills required to build, manage, and grow a business can be learned, and this education can level the playing field. VCs who judge entrepreneurs based on age, sex, ethnicity, or family background are doing their limited partners, and society, a great disservice.There was one criticism of my last post that caused me to do serious introspection.Â\\xa0 The question: was Bill Gatesâ\\x80\\x99s dad an entrepreneur? I cited Gates Jr. as an example of an entrepreneur who didnâ\\x80\\x99t come from an entrepreneurial family. A number of readers, including Jason Calacanis, pointed, out that Gates Sr. was a partner in a law firm, and so an entrepreneur, arguing that my citation was therefore faulty.Iâ\\x80\\x99ve debated and written about this issue before. The broader question is whether anyone who starts a business, whether it is a law practice, a computer consulting firm, or a dry-cleaning store, is an entrepreneur. Management guru Peter Drucker would have answered with a definitive No. He wrote, â\\x80\\x9cNot every new small business is entrepreneurial or represents entrepreneurshipâ\\x80¦ entrepreneurs innovate. Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship.&#8221; Drucker didnâ\\x80\\x99t mince words.When I told this to some of my friends, I heard loud protests. Murali Bashyam, who started an immigration-law practice, insisted he was as much an entrepreneur as Bill Gates and his dad. Murali threatened, â\\x80\\x9cif you decide that Iâ\\x80\\x99m not an entrepreneur, I might decide that the daily stress of growing and running a business, financial risks involved, and all the other headaches that come with creating something out of nothing is just not worth it. Maybe Iâ\\x80\\x99ll close up and go work for someone, where I can earn a steady and high salary and go home at 5 pmâ\\x80\\x9d.Similarly, Sue Drakeford, who was Miss Nebraska 2001, had started a production company to host its own pageants and teach other African American women like her to gain the confidence and skills to compete in the real world. She wanted to provide a wholesome alternative to what she called the â\\x80\\x9ccold-blooded cutthroat world of modeling and beauty pageantsâ\\x80\\x9d.Â\\xa0 But Sue was working full-time at a bank and ran this business on the side. Was she an entrepreneur?Â\\xa0 Sue insisted she was.After agonizing over this for weeks, I went to my friends at the Kauffman Foundation, and they referred me to their book titled â\\x80\\x9cGood Capitalism, Bad Capitalismâ\\x80\\x9d. Carl Schramm and Bob Litan wrote that all who take the risk are entrepreneurs, but that there are two types of entrepreneurs: â\\x80\\x9cReplicative entrepreneursâ\\x80\\x9d, who constitute the vast majority of small businesses (such as restaurants and dry cleaners), and â\\x80\\x9cinnovative entrepreneursâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 the rare few who bring new products/services to market or who pioneer new production methods (such as Walmart, eBay, and Dell).Under the Kauffman definition, Sue would qualify as an â\\x80\\x9cinnovative entrepreneurâ\\x80\\x9d, because she is developing new services and pioneering new methods. In contrast, Murali would be a â\\x80\\x9creplicative entrepreneurâ\\x80\\x9d, because he delivers a standardized service in a field that charges primarily by the hour for its time. Murali could well end up running a huge law firm and be worth many millions, but that doesn&#8217;t make him particularly innovative in his business model.So Bill Gates Sr. was a â\\x80\\x9creplicative entrepreneurâ\\x80\\x9d, and Gates Jr. was an â\\x80\\x9cinnovative entrepreneurâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 whom Silicon Valley calls an â\\x80\\x9centrepreneurâ\\x80\\x9d. TechCrunch founder, Mike Arrington, who used to be a lawyer for Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, would qualify as an â\\x80\\x9cinnovative entrepreneurâ\\x80\\x9d, because he created a new product (a blogging site) and was a pioneer in the new-media world.You can bring innovation to â\\x80\\x9creplicativeâ\\x80\\x9d fields as Arrington did. Take the example of SunRun. The company installs solar cells â\\x80\\x94 which is as mundane or â\\x80\\x9creplicativeâ\\x80\\x9d a business as you can get. But its CEO, Edward Fenster, developed a new business model under which his company installs solar panels on a customer&#8217;s house for little to no upfront cost and only charges for the power that customers use.Â\\xa0 SunRun also insures, maintains, repairs, and monitors the system, and provides a money-back guarantee on the system&#8217;s energy production. This has made solar power available to the masses at an affordable cost and the company has become largest residential solar company in the country, operating in five states, and growing at more than 400% per year.Another great example Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen of an entrepreneur who has innovated in a replicative industry is Nand Kishore Chaudhary. He brought automation, supply-chain management, and professional business practices to the mundane process of carpet weaving and distribution in the desert state of Rajasthan, India.Â\\xa0 By implementing modern production practices and ERP technology, he was able to grow a small business, Jaipur Rugs, that heâ\\x80\\x99d run from his home into a world-class production and distribution company, which employed 40,000 workers and generated $21 million in revenue in 2008. This is in a land where PCs were, until recently, as scarce as rainwater.Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the moral of the story? Donâ\\x80\\x99t listen to the naysayers who are simply defending their informed views and biases by telling you that itâ\\x80\\x99s nature or some special DNA that makes entrepreneurs or leads to entrepreneurial success. Donâ\\x80\\x99t even be discouraged if youâ\\x80\\x99re in a mundane, replicative industry. You can learn the skills needed to become a successful entrepreneur, and you can innovate.Editorâ\\x80\\x99s note: Guest writer Vivek Wadhwa is  an entrepreneur turned academic.

       "  'comments_content': 'One of the cofounders of Zynga, the company&#8217;s executive vice president of sales and business development Andrew Trader, is no longer with the company, we&#8217;ve confirmed. He has been quietly removed from the company&#8217;s management page. Remaining cofounders &#8211; Mark Pincus, Michael Luxton, Eric Schiermeyer, Justin Waldron and Steve Schoettler, remain. As of a month ago Trader&#8217;s title had been downgraded  to VP of Partnerships and Studio Services, although no top sales or business development replacement executive has yet been named.Why is he gone? No one is saying. CEO Mark Pincus says only &#8220;AT [Andrew Trader] and zynga have parted ways. He made an awesome contribution. We need to continue scaling the company.&#8221; Trader hasn&#8217;t yet returned a phone call asking for his comment.Zynga&#8217;s revenue growth has been nothing short of astronomical over the last 18 months, so it would be hard to blame him for not bringing in the dollars. Perhaps he took the fall for the Scamville saga although that has largely blown over now.  Trader was with Zynga nearly three years, so he&#8217;s vested on a lot of his stock. Given how much money is at stake, the whole story about why the first cofounder of Zynga has left the building may never come out. Zynga raised $180 million in December 2009, at a rumored valuation of above $2 billion.And no, I have no idea why he&#8217;s holding a banana in the picture.Update: Trader was a member of the Zynga &#8220;founding team,&#8221; but didn&#8217;t join until August 2007, about nine months after the company was founded.Update 2: Trader emails: &#8220;Iâ\\x80\\x99m leaving Zynga to pursue other entrepreneurial opportunities and to spend more time with my family.  My passion and strengths are really in company building at the early stages and Iâ\\x80\\x99m excited about returning to those efforts soon with a new venture.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m leaving Zynga with 800 employees, more than 230 million monthly users,  and with the high-class problems of scaling a massive and successful organization.   Iâ\\x80\\x99m incredibly proud of the results I helped Zynga achieve as both a member of the founding team &amp; senior executive.   I was a company builder in many areas including revenue management, business development, marketing, recruiting, and business operations.   Iâ\\x80\\x99m departing on great terms with the company and I continue to believe deeply in Zynga, its mission, and its people.

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s hardly a secret that all of the major location-based players are planning big updates to their services to coincide with the SXSW festival starting next week in Austin, Texas. One of them peeked out a bit early: Foursquare.Earlier today, the latest version of Foursquare, 1.6, went live in the App Store for a brief period of time. I&#8217;ve been using the build for a couple of days, and while the functionality isn&#8217;t all that different from the previous versions, the look-and-feel has been completely revamped.This is notable because the vast majority of Foursquare users are still using the iPhone (67%). So this update will be a welcome change for many, especially as Foursquare and Gowalla continue to compete. Gowalla, while smaller than Foursquare, is generally considered to be the prettier of the two. Certainly, with its new website revamp, Gowalla still holds that title on the web, but the new Foursquare app looks pretty nice compared to the Gowalla iPhone app now.So what&#8217;s different? The entire color palette is now a mixture of silver, blue, white, and bright green. Some may not like the bright green elements, but it&#8217;s effective to let people know where to click when you want to check-in. Also new is the fact that the &#8220;Shout&#8221; button is emphasized on the upper left part of the main screen. &#8220;Shouting&#8221; is basically the equivalent of tweeting out a message, it allows you to send a message to your followers without having to check-in at a place. It&#8217;s a bit odd that this is now a main button on the left side while the &#8220;Check-in&#8221; button is on the right side (considering most people read left to right).Another new element is the idea of categories. As we wrote about a couple of days ago, Foursquare is starting to categorize venues into certain categories. While there isn&#8217;t much you can do with these yet on the new iPhone app, you are able to see icons that represent how a venue is categorized.Something else new that is nice is that you can click on individual venues in your friend stream to load that venue&#8217;s main screen (which now shows who is there, right away). Previously, you had to click on your friend, then click over to see the venue â\\x80\\x94 so this saves time.While using the app, I wondered if Apple would approve it given that it uses the text, email, and phone icons used by the iPhone itself within the app (see screenshot below), but apparently if they accidentally put it in the store today, they&#8217;re going to be okay with those icons. These icons are shown on the new profile pages, which also show how many mayorships a member as, as well as how many badges they&#8217;ve earned. Interestingly, the point-based element of the app has been depreciated a bit, as that&#8217;s how a harder-to-get-to area of the app.As a bonus to this advanced iPhone preview that some users got today, Foursquare also launched a new version of its Android app tonight. I&#8217;ve been playing with that for a few minutes, and that seems very solid as well. Look for the new version of Foursquare iPhone app at some point late next week when SXSW starts.

       "  'comments_content': 'For the past several weeks, there have been quite a few whispers around the web about a new service called Burbn. Besides having a great name, the service is apparently in a very hot space right now: location-based services. I say &#8220;apparently,&#8221; because the service is still very much a stealth project. But it&#8217;s not so stealth that they can&#8217;t get a seed round of funding.Burbn has just closed a $500,000 seed round, we&#8217;re hearing. According to sources, both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz participated in the round. From what we can tell, right now, Burbn is just a one-man shop: Kevin Systrom, a former Googler. With the funding, you can probably expect that to change soon.So aside from potentially being the location space, what is Burbn? Well, the current splash page where you can sign up to get for information, tells us a little bit more: &#8220;Burbn is a new way to communicate + share in the real world.&#8221; While that may sound like Google Buzz or a handful of other services, the key to that is &#8220;in the real world,&#8221; again, this reeks of location.We&#8217;ve also heard that the site currently being tested is a mobile web app that uses HTML5 to work in both iPhone and Android browsers.

       "  'comments_content': 'Late last year, Ustream and qik launched iPhone applications that let you stream videos from the iPhone to the web and allow others to watch them as they&#8217;re being recorded. And now there is an iPhone app called TwitCasting Live (iTunes link), which offers the same basic functionality, but is &#8211; as the name suggests &#8211; much more deeply integrated into Twitter.The free app is essentially a live streaming app and Twitter client rolled into one. TwitCasting Live splits the iPhone screen in half, allowing you to view your Twitter timeline, update your status, access the web etc. on the bottom half, while recording (broadcasting) video on the top.When the recording begins, you can automatically tweet out a specific URL for the broadcast (&#8220;I&#8217;m live on Twitcasting!&#8221;) to your followers who just need to hit the link to watch the live stream on the web or even on their iPhones (iPhone users won&#8217;t hear sound though). The app comes in especially handy during events, for example. After the broadcast, you can choose to save and archive the recording on the TwitCasting website.TwitCasting Live works with both the iPhone 3G and 3GS, under Wi-Fi or 3G. Results were OK during tests with my 3G under a Japanese 3G network (I live in Japan), but naturally performance is best when using the app with Wi-Fi and a 3GS.Tokyo-based Twitcasting provider sidefeed claims video latency is as low as 0.3-2.0 seconds in most countries, adding 750 concurrent viewers are the maximum the app can handle at the moment (although this number will be boosted to &#8220;a couple of thousands of viewers&#8221; next week).Launched in Japan first, the English version made its formal debut during a demo event from TechCrunch Japan last week. Sidefeed says they have accommodated over 50,000 live broadcasts (80% over 3G) in the first four weeks and that they&#8217;re currently thinking about an Android port.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Affiliate fees are all over the web and often we don&#8217;t even know that we are clicking on affiliate links when we click through to make purchases at our favorite online retailers. On average, affiliate fees can range from 3 to 10 percent of the price of a product. Browsarity is hoping to put money collected from affiliate programs to philanthropic use, and keep a portion for itself in the process. The Y Combinator-incubated company has launched a Firefox plug-in that will rewrite any unclaimed links to a participating online retailer with an affiliate link, and donate any fees collected towards the charity of your choice. Once downloaded, Browsarity will automatically scan any links to determine if there is an affiliate program and link associated with the retailer and will underline the link in red. So if you search to buy an iPhone on Google or read a blog post with a link to a book on Amazon, Browsarity will underline the affiliate links for retailers which could result in fees that go to charity. If you purchase the item through the affiliate link, the fees will be deposited into a PayPal account operated by Browsarity.  Most of the fees in that account will be donated to a charity of your choice. Browsarity will take a 10 percent cut of each affiliate fee, so 90 percent is donated to the charity.Currently Browsarity offers nine different charities to choose from, including The Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and the Black Eyed Peas&#8217; charity PeaPod. The startup says it has partnerships with at least ten &#8220;big-name&#8221; e-retailers to collect affiliate fees for charity. There is also a viral component to the service.  You can send your friends and family links to install copies of Browsarity pre-set for a certain charity,  and the system will keep track of how much money has been generated for that charity as a result of your efforts. In an effort to preserve users&#8217; privacy, Browsarity doesn&#8217;t track individual purchases. While only available for Firefox at the moment, Browsarity will be launching plug-ins and extensions for Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer in the coming weeks. The startup faces competition from Browse For A Cause, which has a similar model. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A few weeks ago, we noted that the Denver, CO-based design company Aten Design Group was holding a funeral for Internet Explorer 6 (IE6), the much-hated browser. The funeral took place last night. It wasn&#8217;t without controversy as there were protestors, and even a bouquet of flowers sent by Microsoft. But overall, it looks like it was a classy ceremony.The blog Nonprofits and Web 2.0 was on hand and has posted several videos (a few of which I&#8217;ll embed below). There&#8217;s also a huge set of pictures in this Flickr album. As we noted originally, despite the funeral, IE6 is likely to live on for a few years as many sites are likely to still support it for the foreseeable future (though YouTube turns off support next week). And don&#8217;t forget all those pour souls in corporate jobs who are forced to use the browser because their IT departments won&#8217;t allow them to upgrade.Microsoft itself is trying to get users to upgrade from IE6 (to their updated IE8), and the flowers that they sent to the funeral speak to that. The card sent with the flowers read: &#8220;Thanks for the good times, IE6. See you all @ MIX, where we&#8217;ll show a little piece of IE heaven.

       "  'comments_content': 'San Francisco based Posterous, a fast growing publishing platform, has taken a $4.4 million investment from Redpoint Ventures. Partner Satish Dharmaraj, who is also an individual investor in Posterous, led the round and joins the company&#8217;s board of directors (and he maintains his personal blog at Posterous here).Posterous, founded in 2008 by Sachin Agarwal, Garry Tan and Brett Gibson,  is a Y Combinator company that began as a way for users to very easily post pictures online. Its appeal lies in its simplicity &#8211; users can just email a photo to post@posterous.com and an account is immediately created for them. But today people are using Posterous for videos and text blogs as well. Users can change the CSS and even use their own domain names &#8211; see Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s HolKaw blog, for example, which is run by Posterous.The company does have revenue, such as this early deal with Coca Cola for a branded site, but has stood firm in keeping the &#8220;nickel and dime&#8221; consumer fees out of the product. There are no restrictions on usage, storage, CSS customization or using your own domain, says the company. Later this year Posterous will launch a pro version of the service for bigger brands, and allow things like Javascript and site monetization for a fee, they say.All that simplicity and freeness has resulted in a lot of growth for the company. They have 12 million unique monthly visitors, they say, and 25 million page views. And they grew 30% per month in 2009, all with just 4 employees (they are up to 6 now).Posterous regularly releases new products, such as Post.ly a month ago. Post.ly lets users easily share media on their Twitter account.CEO Sachin Agarwal says that they want to continue to add new products that make it dead simple to post and share content online: &#8220;Our goal is to become synonymous with &#8220;posting&#8221; just like Google is synonymous with &#8220;search&#8221;.

In fact, because the account doesn&#8217;t tweet all that regularly (I suppose creator Justin Halpern is busy trying to write dialogue for William Shatner, who will star in the show), there are only five total tweet imported so far since February 10, when the account was started. Still, there&#8217;s a lot of activity on those five tweets, with dozens of Buzz users liking and commenting on the blurbs.There&#8217;s no way of knowing if this account is an official one since anyone can import any public Twitter account into their Buzz steam, but even if fake, the creator did a nice job recreating Justin&#8217;s father. For example, his profile says that the one thing he can&#8217;t find on Google is &#8220;my pants.&#8221; And his hometown is shown on a Google Map as somewhere just outside Columbus, Ohio. The About Me section reads the same as the Twitter bio, &#8220;I&#8217;m 29. I live with my 74-year-old dad. He is awesome. I just write down shit that he says.&#8221;The most interesting thing about this account may be its level of engagement. If I were on the Buzz team, I might point out that even though this account is doing nothing beyond importing tweets, there&#8217;s clearly a huge demand to have conversations about these tweets â\\x80\\x94 something which is much easier to do on Buzz then on Twitter. Of course, some brands are already understanding this.Also note that the account name is technically &#8220;sh1tmydadsays,&#8221; because Google won&#8217;t allow swear word in Gmail addresses.[thanks Louis]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last month, Google acquired reMail, the startup behind a very powerful application that brought full-text search to the iPhone.  That&#8217;s great news for the reMail team, but it had a major downside: Google was effectively killing off the product by removing it from the App Store (though it would continue to function for users that had already downloaded the app).  Fortunately, today comes news that reMail will continue to live on in some form: the company has just announced that it&#8217;s open sourcing the product.  You can find the Google Code site for the project here.Founder Gabor Cselle outlines what the product&#8217;s code can be helpful for:As someone who is passionate about mobile email, my hope is that developers interested in making email-related apps can use reMail code as a starting point. Part of the reason email apps are hard is because you have to pay the tax of figuring out how to download email via IMAP, parse MIME messages, handle attachments, and store data. reMail has already solved these problems. If you have a great mobile email idea, I hope you will find reMail&#8217;s source code helpful in your quest.There&#8217;s a good chance that we&#8217;ll soon see reworkings of the app for the iPhone: the project&#8217;s documentation specifically details how to get it up and running on the popular platform.  The Google Code site also includes some ideas on how to improve the application, based on some of reMail&#8217;s most common feature requests (suggestions include implementation of a landscape mode, more compatible email account types, and improved autocomplete).Google did something similar to EtherPad late last year, after it acquired the application&#8217;s developer AppJet.  At first, EtherPad was simply going to shut down as the team moved to Australia to work on Google Wave. But after significant backlash, Google and AppJet quickly made moves to open source the project.',\n",

Fiverr takes $1 off of the $5 fee. Gigs range from installing WordPress on a server to reading Tarot cards to writing a romantic sonnet. Tasks are divided into categories, including Funny and Bizarre, Social Marketing, Graphics, Writing,Technology, Business, Silly Stuff and Programming. The idea is kind of brilliant and also entertaining. While you don&#8217;t necessarily have assurance that your task will be completed to your standards, you are only shelling out $5 for the task, so it&#8217;s not a total loss if the gig falls through or isn&#8217;t done well.

Appolicious, which just raised $1.5 million in funding and debuted an iPhone app, tries to make sense of the 100,000 apps on Apple&#8217;s App Store and the 16,000 apps on the Android Market, but with a social twist. So not only can you find apps based on category or topic, but you can share those apps with your social graph on Twitter and Facebook, review apps, and more.The Appolicious Facebook app allows users to access Appolicious&#8217; recently launched Curated App Lists, which are recommended lists of apps from users based around hobbies and interests. The startup also launched Twicker, an ad format where advertisers send customized messages to the Appolicious audience via Twitter. The Tweets are seen on a ticker at the top of the site&#8217;s page. Sponsors pay a monthly fee to advertise via the Twicker. Additionally, Appolicious is rolling out the Appo.me URL shortner, which gives the ability to easily create, grab and share a shortened URL that links directly to an app. You simple type in the name of an iPhone app and Appo.me automatically completes the app name and will give you a shortened URL for the link to the app in the iTunes store and its landing page on Appolicious&#8217; directory. Appolicious&#8217; Facebook app will compete with the mPlayit, a Facebook-based mobile app directory. But the feature I find most compelling is the URL shortener, which makes it dead simple to find and link to any app on Apple&#8217;s App Store. Founded in May of this year by former Yahoo VP, Alan Warms, Appolicious is hoping to expand its platform to include Blackberry and other smartphone apps. Warms is a serial entrepreneur who sold his startup Buzztracker to Yahoo in 2007.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The company had around 40 employees working on the two games, some of whom will be reassigned to work on other projects.

The magic-themed SuperPocus launched in October, and Top Fish, a virtual aquarium app, launched in early November.  Both games were designed to turn into virtual economies that revolved around virtual gifts.

Players create and customize a single avatar and use it to play the various games that others have created. In the initial beta users needed to download software to build and play Atmosphir games. Last year the company decided to move to the Unity platform to allow for in-browser game creation and playing. Unity does require a plugin, but the experience is significantly lighter on the client.Game creators have nearly unlimited freedom to create worlds from whatever they imagine. Games can be combat or puzzle based (or both), multi-user or not, and an audience of users will jump in and try out whatever new levels/games are built immediately. This is still a beta project with a long waiting list, and the company is just starting to move existing users to the new platform. But if you&#8217;re a game designer and want in now, we have ten designer accounts to give away. Just let us know in the comments why you think you&#8217;d be a good choice for one. Check out the video below for an idea of what Atmosphir is all about.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Using the combination of camera and software on today&#8217;s smartphones to read barcodes is becoming increasingly popular. Want proof? Look no further than Google, which is building it into their own Android devices. And Microsoft, which is even offering such software on rival phones by Google and Apple. Today, one of the big players in this space, Big In Japan, is announcing the acquisition of another former player, Snappr, to beef up the offering.Big In Japan is best known as the app production house behind ShopSavvy, the mobile shopping utility. It has long been one of the cooler apps on Android, and recently it became available for the iPhone too. With it, you can simply scan a barcode in a store and find out information about a product â\\x80\\x94 most notably, if you can find it somewhere else for a cheaper price. Snappr, meanwhile, deadpooled in late 2009, but was an early player in 2D barcode scanning (particularly QR codes) with smartphones.With the acquisition, Big In Japan picks up Snappr&#8217;s technology, which they will integrate into ShopSavvy. And Snppr founder, Philip Stehlik, will join Big In Japan&#8217;s board of advisors. Snappr&#8217;s former website already redirects to a new Big In Japan holding page.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but again, this is a company that was already deadpooled, so it was most likely a pretty cheap pick up of some technology by Big In Japan.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last week, we reported on a class-action lawsuit filed in Los Angeles alleging that  Yelp was running an &#8220;extortion scheme&#8221;.  Today, the company has just gotten slapped by a second, similar suit, this time coming from the D&#8217;ames Day Spa of San Diego County, which is accusing Yelp of removing many positive reviews because the spa declined to run ads on the site.  In a very prompt response, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has just written a blog post titled Different Day, Different Lawyer, Same Meritless Claim: A Classic Race to the Courthouse in which he looks to debunk the new case.  We&#8217;ve embedded the lawsuit below, which was posted online by The Next Web.The suit claims that Yelp removed 13 out of 14 positive reviews about the Day Spa.  But Stoppelman writes that the Spa has admitted that it solicited the reviews in question, which the site has repeatedlyÂ\\xa0instructed businesses not to do.Â\\xa0 The suit confirms that the spa did solicit the reviews:In or around August, 2009, LaPausky contacted GROUPON to promote her business, D&#8217;ames Day Spa, through a mass email marketing campaign.  A GROUPON representative informed LaPausky that her business needed more on-line reviews and/or comments to be featured in a GROUPON marketing campaign.LaPausky began asking her customers to leave feedback regarding their D&#8217;ames Day Spa experiences on Yelp.com.  In a short while, D&#8217;ames Day Spa&#8217;s reviews on Yelp totaled approximately fourteen, many of them very positive and detailed.&#8221;Stoppelman also writes that this is a &#8220;copy cat&#8221; suit, driven by lawyers looking to jump on the bandwagon. From Stoppelman&#8217;s post:These copy cat suits get filed in what is known as a &#8220;race to the courthouse,&#8221; where lawyers jockey to be named the lead lawyer of the case and take the biggest share of legal fees; being among the first to file a suit increases the chance of being put in charge of the case.So, as I said: it&#8217;s not a surprise to see another such frivolous suit. In fact, it&#8217;s kind of expected.This doesn&#8217;t change a thing however: this suit, like the other, is without merit, we will fight it aggressively and we believe we will win.It&#8217;s worth pointing out that even if the reviews on Yelp were admittedly solicited, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the case is dead in the water â\\x80\\x94 the spa can still look to prove that Yelp offered to overlook these potentially fraudulent reviews if the spa purchased ads (or that Yelp removed more reviews when the spa declined).Update: Yelp has reminded us that they&#8217;ve explicitly denied that they ever offered preferential treatment in exchange for money.&#8220;Simply put, Yelp does not remove or hide negative reviews in exchange for money and Yelp salespeople do not offer to do so. Additionally, Yelp treats review content equally for advertisers and non-advertisers alike. Advertisers pay for advertising and enhanced listings, and nothing more; and businesses are not penalized for declining to advertise.&#8221;    View this document on Scribd',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'According to the site Gigatweet, we are about an hour away from the 10 billionth tweet sent since the dawn of Twitter. More incredible, this milestone comes less than 5 months after the 5 billionth tweet.The only problem? It&#8217;s not an exact science.Gigatweet isn&#8217;t counting to an exact number, but rather is extrapolating out when the 10 billionth tweet will hit based on previous tweet data provided from a range of sources. Most recently, we do know that Twitter is seeing about 50 million tweets per day now, because the service released that information. Other than that, it&#8217;s kind of a crapshoot.To determine when the 5 billionth tweet would happen, watchers were looking at the numbers appended on to the URL of each tweet when it&#8217;s sent. The same is true this time around. For example, this recent tweet has the number 9996229078 in the URL. So yes, it would seem that is tweet number 9,996,229,078, but the problem is that Twitter has altered these numbers several times over the years, notably to move up the so-called Twitpocalypse (both 1 and 2).As Twitter employee Ryan King notes, &#8220;Though its more numerology than math, it still scares me that this is my job,&#8221; followed by a link to Gigatweet. What he means is that no, it&#8217;s not exactly right, but it&#8217;s kind of cool, and perhaps close enough.An interesting side note: the guy who sent tweet number 5 billion, Robin Sloan, now works at Twitter. Who will be number 10 billion? We&#8217;ll know in about an hour.Update: And here it is â\\x80\\x94 but apparently, most of us can&#8217;t see it because that user has a protected stream.

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier today, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gave a speech at the University of Washington where he said that the company was going &#8220;all in&#8221; with its strategy to move Microsoft products to the cloud.  We&#8217;ve gotten our hands on an all-staff email sent out by Ballmer (printed below), which appears to be legitimate.  The email reiterates many of the points Ballmer said during his speech this morning, urging employees to embrace the cloud.  It also notes that Microsoft will launch an ad campaign today focused on its commercial and government businesses, which stand to benefit from cloud services.Update: We&#8217;ve confirmed with Microsoft that the email is legitimate.Today, I spoke to a group of students and faculty at the University of Washington to discuss how cloud computing will change the way people and businesses use technology. My goal was to challenge people to look at the cloud more broadly and understand the multidimensional nature of the cloud transformation happening today. Other companies have defined the cloud in a narrow, one-dimensional way. Although these companies provide some interesting components, Microsoft is uniquely delivering on a wide range of cloud capabilities that bring increasingly more value to our customers.In my speech, I outlined the five dimensions that define the way people use and realize value in the cloud:â\\x80¢       The cloud creates opportunities and responsibilitiesâ\\x80¢       The cloud Â\\xa0learns and helps you learn, decide and take actionâ\\x80¢       The cloud enhances your social and professional interactionsâ\\x80¢       The cloud wants smarter devicesâ\\x80¢       The cloud drives server advances that drive the cloudThis view fuels our investments across Â\\xa0the entire company, from datacenters to cloud platform technologies to cloud-based development tools and applications. Today, nearly every one of our products has, or is developing, features or services that support the cloud. As I said today, when it comes to the cloud, we are all in. We are all in across every product line we have and across every dimension of the cloud.Of course, this is not news to any of you. We have been making huge investments in the cloud for the past decade. Nearly five  years Â\\xa0ago, Rayâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cServices Disruptionâ\\x80\\x9d memo provided the outline for what we needed to do as a company, and with the delivery of Windows Azure at the recent PDC, we have made huge strides in making this vision real.To keep our momentum, it is critical that Â\\xa0every Microsoft employee works to deliver the full benefits of the cloud to our customers.As a part of this, I request that you do the following:â\\x80¢       Watch the speech on demand hereâ\\x80¢       Learn more about our cloud offerings and how they relate to our overarching software plus services strategy hereâ\\x80¢       Review your commitments to ensure you are landing our vision with customers and partners.Of course, there is more work to do. We have strong competitors. We need to be (and are) willing to change our business models to take advantage of the cloud. We must move at â\\x80\\x9ccloud speed,â\\x80\\x9d especially in our consumer offerings. And we need to be crystal clear about the value we provide to all our customers.To drive our message home even further, today you will see an ad campaign in the U.S. focused on our commercial and government businesses, a new website with consolidated content and case studies, and ongoing emphasis on the cloud from me and other members of the SLT in our upcoming speeches and presentations.We have an enormous opportunity in front of us. We have great products and services in the market today and a range of new ones on their way.All of our products make the cloud better, and the cloud makes our products better.Thanks,SteveCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m from a relatively small city in Ohio called Pepper Pike. If I want to find out news about it, the easiest thing for me to do is Google &#8220;Pepper Pike News.&#8221; The number one result is quite useful: Topix.In fact, Topix is the number one result for a ton of small towns across the country. That&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;ve been aggregating local news for six years. But the site has never garnered much attention in the startup scene because back in 2005 (before TechCrunch even existed â\\x80\\x94 our initial coverage was in 2007), it took a majority equity investment from three of the largest media firms in the U.S., Knight Ridder, Tribune and Gannett. Since then, the focus has been all about getting the business to work.And while Topix has been through some permutations throughout the years, the focus has always been on local and yes, topics. Aggregation was the key to all of this for a while, but in recent years, the community that uses the site has been largely responsible for a lot of the content. And that&#8217;s more clear than ever as the site is about to cross 100 million posts (comments).The milestone should be hit at some point today, as the site is getting aboutÂ\\xa0125,000 comments a day now. That&#8217;s on top of 120 million average monthly pageviews fromÂ\\xa08.8 million unique visitors. All huge numbers for a site that hardly anyone talks about.But that&#8217;s the thing, people are talking about it, you just may not realize it unless you&#8217;re in one of these smaller towns. For these people, Topix is a gathering spot to discuss the local news. Many of these cities (like Pepper Pike) may not have a daily local newspaper or website that makes it easy to discuss issues. That&#8217;s exactly what Topix does. And perhaps even a little too easy as the site has toÂ\\xa0remove some 45,000 comments a month due to things like hate speech, CEO and co-founder Chris Tolles tells us.Not just that, Topix gets about 10 subpoenas a week due to comments, Tolles says. That&#8217;s a pain, but it&#8217;s the price you pay for having such an active community.Why not ban anonymous commenting? Tolles has thought about this a lot, and done internal studies. But all conclude that it wouldn&#8217;t be good for the site. For example, while you&#8217;reÂ\\xa050% more likely to get a crappy comment from anonymous commenter, you&#8217;re also going to get five times the number of comments when you allow for anonymous ones. And if there&#8217;s a situation where a person feels the need to call out a local official, doing so anonymously allows them to feel protected, Tolles says.So, Topix has all these comments, and all this content â\\x80\\x94 but the challenge has been how to monetize it. While Topix has deals with seveal big players, including CNN, the real money remains in advertising. So Tolles has spent much of the past year building up an ad sales team. And following the ad collapse last year, it&#8217;s finally starting to pay off. Topix is seeing $4 eCPMs, Tolles says. If that keeps up, he thinks the site can turn a profit relatively soon.Something else interesting about Topix: mobile usage is huge. While the service has had (what Tolles considers to be currently a sub-par) iPhone app for a while, it&#8217;s the mobile web that people seem to be taking to to use the site. And something like 75% of the people who are actively commenting on a mobile device are visiting from an iPhone. That may seem somewhat surprising given Topix&#8217;s focus on small towns and communities, but it seems to speak to the iPhone&#8217;s appeal to the masses. The big time commenting numbers also apparently speak to Topix&#8217;s appeal to the masses.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz continued to talk about Yahoo&#8217;s regrouping strategy at an advertising industry conference earlier this week.She touched on the topics we covered in our post last week, The Steady, Efficient Decline Of Yahoo. Specifically, she&#8217;s counting on an improvement in the economy to drive Yahoo growth, and she claims to have made significant advances in display advertising tools, targeting and analytics. &#8220;People still have to display their brand in a more descriptive way than just keywords,&#8221; she told Advertising Age.When asked if Yahoo was any different from AOL, she responded &#8220;Generally it&#8217;s not different, we&#8217;re just a lot bigger. The fact of the matter is, what they&#8217;re trying to do at AOL &#8212; and I shouldn&#8217;t speak for AOL, they&#8217;re very capable of speaking for themselves &#8212; but I think it&#8217;s like a mini Yahoo.&#8221;AOL draws 110 million monthly unique U.S. visitors, says Comscore, compared to 164 million for Yahoo (January 2010).Bartz also says Yahoo will be making acquisitions to drive content. &#8220;This year it&#8217;s about what technologies: Do we need to fill in the blanks, what analytics, what tools?&#8221; she said.She added &#8220;Well just imagine whether it&#8217;s acquiring an audience &#8212; a group of female bloggers, or whether it&#8217;s acquiring some better analytics tools that help us guide campaigns with our partners, or whether it&#8217;s technology.&#8221;And &#8220;social&#8221; says Bartz, doesn&#8217;t begin and end with Facebook: &#8220;You know, social is a word that has almost become too narrow. And I think with Facebook&#8217;s immense success, all of the sudden that&#8217;s the only definition of social. But if you think back to the finance chat rooms, [those] were the beginning of social and people could actually interact. &#8230; As we look at social we want people to be on the Yahoo site and have tweets come in and have their Facebook postings come in, so that it&#8217;s a very personal place to be that helps them understand what&#8217;s going on in their social world.&#8221;In Bartz&#8217;s social world, it seems, people are reading Twitter and Facebook messages on Yahoo. But this patchwork strategy of taking a little of this, a little of that isn&#8217;t going to excite users and encourage them to spend much time on Yahoo. Despite their massive reach, time on site isn&#8217;t going anywhere. But at least we know where Yahoo stands on things. Little or no product innovation, little or no risk taking. And like I said before, a long, slow, steady decline. And despite Bartz&#8217;s last words in the interview, copied below, there is nothing exciting or crazy going on at Yahoo.For an industry that&#8217;s based on creativity and inspiring people, I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s so afraid. I don&#8217;t think it should be afraid to just try some crazy new stuff. But when I talk to people about online marketing, they just seem to freeze. &#8230; I thought this was going to be a much racier industry that wore black and got out there and rock and rolled and I see it being a little shier. I mean, I&#8217;m the crazy lady.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Remember Google Wave? No, not Google Buzz â\\x80\\x94 Wave, that other social information pump that Google launched last year. It&#8217;s hard to blame you if you don&#8217;t. While Google&#8217;s goals are ambitious with Wave, many users couldn&#8217;t figure out what to do with it, or why they needed it in their lives. Perhaps more importantly, it was basically impossible to know if someone was talking to you in Wave unless you had it open all the time. Not anymore.Wave is finally turning on email notifications to alert you about new and updated waves. From the Inbox menu, simply select the new &#8220;Notifications&#8221; option to set how often (if at all) you&#8217;d like to receive them. The Wave team recommends that if you&#8217;re not a heavy user of Wave, you should get notified &#8220;immediately&#8221; upon a change. For more active users, the team seems to have a smart approach:When you&#8217;re added to a new wave, or a wave that you are on changes, we&#8217;ll send you an email with a short summary of the text and links to go straight to your updated waves. Rest assured, we know waves can change a lot, so we will only send you one notification about a changed wave until you have logged in to look at it (i.e.: if a wave changes 10 times after we send the first notification, we won&#8217;t send 10 more emails). Waves you have open also won&#8217;t trigger updates.While Google Wave and Buzz are completely different, they do share some similarities, and are fundamentally about Google pushing newer, more social ways to communicate. Of course, with Wave, Google didn&#8217;t shove it into the massively-used Gmail, so it seems that Wave hasn&#8217;t been able to gain the footing that Buzz has â\\x80\\x94 even though Buzz arguably needs more work than Wave right now. As of December, Wave had sent out a million invites, but there are probably several times more people already using Buzz â\\x80\\x94 again, just because of the Gmail thing.The Wave team notes that this feature is still a work in progress and that there are some bugs (the ones listed don&#8217;t seem major).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'It was only December when Google officially launched extensions for its Chrome browser. Almost immediately, there were 500 extensions in the gallery as many developers had been working on them for a while. Today, Google is saying that number is now past 3,000. And that&#8217;s significant because it&#8217;s already pretty close to the browser known for its extensions (which it calls &#8220;add-ons&#8221;), Firefox.The exact number of add-ons for Firefox is a bit unclear. If you go by the category counts on the add-on site, there are 11,623. But it&#8217;s hard to know for sure if there is any overlap between the categories (I couldn&#8217;t find any, but I&#8217;m not sure there isn&#8217;t). More significantly, if you go by Mozilla&#8217;s statistic site where they tout their numbers, they claim to only have around 6,000 add-ons. To quote them, &#8220;Over 6,000 free, community contributed Add-ons for Firefox &#8211; more than for any other browser&#8220;. And in case you think this data is out of date, notes other 2010 milestones, such as the launch of Firefox 3.6.On its add-ons page, Mozilla notes that there have been over 1.8 billion add-ons downloaded and over 170 million in use. But neither of those numbers are the total number of add-ons, just how often they&#8217;ve been downloaded in total and the total (including the same ones) currently in use by people. Both of these numbers would blow away the still much smaller Chrome, obviously.So, depending on what number you go with, Chrome already has either half or one quarter the number of extensions Firefox does â\\x80\\x94 in just a few months. Why? Well, certainly there&#8217;s a lot of excitement around Chrome right now, which was just released in beta for Mac and Linux at the end of last year. In fact, certain statistics have it as the only major browser that grew in size last month. But for extensions specifically, the rapid growth is likely due to just how easy they are to make for Chrome and maybe more importantly, submit to the extension gallery.Mozilla has done a number of posts recently on its Add-ons Blog to talk about the add-on approval process (here&#8217;s a good one from last month). Much like Apple App Store, Firefox add-ons much be reviewed and approved before they can go live. Chrome Extensions, on the other hand, go live immediately except for a handful that access things such as files on a users computer (those are flagged to be reviewed). Almost all of the extension developers I&#8217;ve talked to prefer Google&#8217;s method, and most of them develop for both. The quick rise in number of extensions for Chrome seems to speak to that.Mozilla is trying to do something about the ease of development too. Its new Jetpack project allows developers to create add-ons using HTML, CSS, and Javascript â\\x80\\x94 exactly how developers create Chrome extensions. So if this method of development catches on, it could help Firefox maintain its extension lead.The battle continues.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Here we go again . . . Apple App Store Fail No. 5102928. A few weeks ago stealth Israeli startup Tawkon gave me a sneak-peak developer build of what I believe is the most important app on my iPhone. What does it do? It analyzes the cellular radiation your iPhone emits at any given moment, at any given location, whether in standby mode, or within a call.Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, that&#8217;s where Israeli hardware and software engineering prowess come into play (more on that in a second). Sadly, Israeli military training may have met its match . . . Â\\xa0the infamous iPhone App Store approval process.The purpose of Tawkon&#8217;s app is to provide the user with an indicationâ\\x80\\x94or &#8220;prediction&#8221; as they call itâ\\x80\\x94of the radiation level being emitted by the iPhone. This level changes based on environmental conditions, distance from cell towers, and even the manner in which the device is held. To illustrate: the iPhone&#8217;s antenna is located at the bottom of the device. If the user cradles the phone too tightly in the palm, the antenna has to work harder, thereby increasing radiation. The 3GS models have improved chipsets, so radiation would be lower on them compared to previous versions, and Tawkon takes this into considering when calculating its prediction.When launched, the app instantly provides users with an indication of the radiation level in the iPhone&#8217;s stand-by mode. A green/orange/red pulse makes this dummy-proof. For example, radiation levels in my office are minimal, but are much higher in the men&#8217;s room which is deeper in the building, where more concrete forces the iPhone to work harder to hold a connection to the nearest cellular base station.To find out what the radiation levels are during a call, the app lets users launch a call through the iPhone&#8217;s address book. It then monitors the radiation levels in real time and sends prompts via vibration and a tone should they reach the high-end of its threshold. The app also employs the iPhone&#8217;s proximity sensor and provides suggestions such as moving location, using a headset and even changing the iPhone&#8217;s orientation to your face.So how does Tawkon do it? Algorithmic magic analyzes your phone&#8217;s dynamic SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) levels, location, environmental factors, as well as unique smart-phone capabilities such as bluetooth, accelerometer, proximity sensors, GPS and compass. The level of radiation a person is exposed to during calls is determined by analyzing several dynamic parameters, including the impact of environmental factors such as distance from cellular towers, network and weather condition, terrain, antenna&#8217;s proximity from the body, antenna orientation (if the user is holding the phone vertically or horizontally) and travel speed.It&#8217;s perfectly natural to be skeptical about Tawkon&#8217;s app, so let me lay out a couple of things to set the record straight: first, Tawkon is not looking for controversy. They contacted me weeks before they submitted the app to the App Store with the sincere hope of not being stonewalled. Ironically, were this a gag app, not only would there have been no controversy, the app&#8217;s revenue potential may actually be higher. Second, I have no way of testing whether the app&#8217;s output is actually correct. However, I took the time to meet the three founders and feel comfortable stating that they struck me as serious, highly capable hardware and software engineers who&#8217;ve spent 18 months developing a technology they believe holds real compelling value for users. They claim the app has gone through lab testing to ensure its output is correct. For what it&#8217;s worth, I take their word for it.Tawkon&#8217;s app has been in the approval process for a couple of weeks with the App Store denying approval on the grounds that a diagnostic tool of this nature would create confusion with iPhone owners from a usability perspective. This reasoning was communicated by an App Store representative on a phone call with the Tawkon team. I find this claim questionable as I&#8217;ve been using the app and there&#8217;s nothing problematic about it in this respect.Tawkon is keeping optimistic, holding hope that Apple will approve the app which they intend to sell for between $5-$10. In the mean time, it&#8217;s plugging ahead in its development of Blackberry and Android versions.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Today marks one of the initial demonstrations of this partnership, with Yahoo Contacts now connected to Facebook. Now Yahoo allows you to add your Facebook friends&#8217; email addresses to your Yahoo Contacts via Facebook Connect. In the Import Contact landing page of your Yahoo account, you&#8217;ll be able to select Facebook (importing from Gmail and Hotmail already exists). Once you authorize the connection with your Facebook credentials, your friendsâ\\x80\\x99 email addresses from their Facebook profiles will be added to your Yahoo Contacts. Yahoo will scan the imports and delete any duplicates.  As we&#8217;ve written in the past, Yahoo&#8217;s move with Facebook shows that the company has given up on leveraging the existing social connections among Yahoo email, address book and messenger users, and thus, weakens its ability to monetize this social graph. And Yahoo also just added Twitter integration to its products as well. While Google&#8217;s Buzz may have its problems, at least Google is making an effort to try to develop technologies  that use its communications products to build a social graph.

All Web applications currently in the App Center &#8211; more than 600 by now &#8211; will automatically be converted to Chrome.The move is interesting because many believe that Google&#8217;s own upcoming operating system, Chrome OS, will overshadow Jolicloud&#8217;s effort in a huge way. If that&#8217;s your line of thought as well, check out Michael Arrington&#8217;s recent interview of Krim on that very subject.Jolicloud says the reasons for the switch, which was decided upon after evaluation of &#8220;different technologies and opportunities&#8221;, were Chrome&#8217;s speed (courtesy of its V8 JavaScript Engine), better memory usage, support for multiple authentication technologies right out the gate (Facebook Connect, Twitter Connect, etc.) and enhanced HTML5 and Web sockets support, among others.However, Jolicloud is quick to point out that the move will not its commitment to Firefox, which will still be the default browser. The startup says the upcoming version of the Jolicloud OS will feature a new desktop mode adapted for all screens larger than 11 inches and be compatible with 100% of Intel-based netbooks (see second screenshot below). In addition, an entirely new release of Jolicloud Express for easy installation on Windows netbooks is on its way.(Full disclosure: Krim will be showing off the new version of Jolicloud next week at Plugg, a conference I organize.

       "  'comments_content': 'Live video streaming on the Web is finally going mainstream.  Livestream, the NYC-based live video streaming startup, just landed a one-year partnership with the Associated Press to power all of the AP&#8217;s live video streams on the Web.  The first event to be streamed live under the new deal will be video from the red carpet at the Oscars this Sunday.The video will be hosted by Livestream at APLive, where viewers can log in to chat with their Twitter or Facebook IDs.  It will also be available on Facebook, where viewers will have to become a fan of APLive in order to watch.  (APLive only has 1,271 fans right now).  The Oscars will be the first of many live video events Livestream will power for the AP.  Under the deal, Livestream and the AP split revenues associated with the APLive video.  Revenues can come from licensing (AP-affiliated publishers can embed the video on their news sites) or advertising (partners can embed the video for free with the APLive branding, which comes with pre-roll plus overlay ads sold by the AP and Livestream jointly).  Consumers and fans can embed the APLIve player for free on their blogs or Facebook pages as long as less than 500 people watch concurrently from any one page. Livestream is seeing significant growth in live video viewership overall.  In February, it streamed 1.1 billion unique viewer minutes, compared to 650 million last August (or nearly double in six months).  CEO Max Hoat says Livestream is showing videos to 17.5 million people a month across its embedded player network, with 3 million of those on its own Website.  Other partners include ESPN, NPR, Fox, Scripps, and National Geographic.  Its biggest competitor, Ustream, is also growing rapidly and just closed a massive funding round.Will this be the year live video on the Web goes legit?  Livestream recently issued a public challenge to its competitors to do more to fight piracy on their networks.  It is clearly gunning for mainstream, and media company, acceptance.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The idea was a way to show people the best food in Japan beyond sushi â\\x80\\x94 to literally show them, in picture form. Then the thought morphed into writing to a book, where the best food in the world was shown. But that&#8217;s a lot of travel for one person. So the thought became, why not crowdsource it? That&#8217;s Foodspotting.Foodspotting is an application that allows you to take picture of a food, say what it is, and pin it (with geolocation) to the restaurant where you got it. You may wonder who would use such an app â\\x80\\x94 but just think for a second about how many of your friends on Twitter tweet out pictures of food. People have been doing this long before Foodspotting, this app just gives them more of an incentive to do so, and let&#8217;s them organize it.It&#8217;s also one hell of a new food discovery tool. And that&#8217;s exactly why the team behind it, Alexa Andrzejewski and Ted Grubb, hustled to get the official iPhone app done in time for the SXSW festival, which starts next week in Austin, Texas. With it, you&#8217;ll be able to use the &#8220;Guides&#8221; to easily find (and contribute to) the best foods in Austin. The Foodspotting team put together a few of these guides (including a scavenger hunt, and a street food one), but other users have already created others as well.From these guides, you can easily mark which foods you &#8220;want&#8221; to bookmark them for later. You can also note which foods you&#8217;ve already eaten (&#8220;nommed&#8221;). Of course, you can also use the app to search for a particular food or restaurant. Or simply scroll through the pictures on the main screen to see a stream of food (which can be sorted by &#8220;latest,&#8221; &#8220;nearest,&#8221; &#8220;best,&#8221; etc). And yes, you can use a map view to see the food too.When you yourself spot a food, you can tweet it out to your followers. Or, thanks to Foursquare&#8217;s relatively new API, you can also check-in to a venue simply by foodspotting (yes, the service hopes the name becomes a common verb).It&#8217;s one of the most interesting location-based plays that will be on display at SXSW â\\x80\\x94 a conference that will be rife with location-based services. But Foodspotting is a bit different because they&#8217;re not aiming to be a location platform like Foursquare or Gowalla. Instead, they&#8217;re happy to use location to augment their own reality-based game. That is, after all, essentially what Foodspotting is. Just like with the other two aforementioned location services, you earn some badges for tagging certain types of foods in pictures (they called them &#8220;Expert Badges&#8221;). And you earn others for participating in the Guides. And, of course, there are points for doing all of this.While the &#8220;lite&#8221; version of the app has been available in the App Store for a few months, the team has done little to promote it, waiting instead until the full version, which launches today in the App Store. Still, the lite version (and the very nice-looking website) proved that there&#8217;s a demand for this service. Already, Foodspotting has seen over 15,000 foodspottings. Top cities include San Francisco, New York, and Honolulu.So how do you make money off of this idea? That&#8217;s a question the Foodspotting team has had to answer a lot recently, as they&#8217;re currently in the process of raising a seed round of funding. The natural idea is to become popular enough that restaurants and brands want to partner with the service to promote themselves.Â\\xa0&#8221;It&#8217;s kind of like pumping a scent out of your bakery window to draw people in,&#8221; Andrzejewski says. Already, the service is teaming up with 7&#215;7, an insider&#8217;s guide to food in San Francisco to show how a partnership could work (it&#8217;s a non-paid partnership, for now).The iPhone app, created for Foodspotting by EGG HAUS, Inc, is available today in the App Store for free. Find it here. Eventually, the plan is to expand to the other mobile platforms as well. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m here at YouTube&#8217;s office in San Bruno, where the company is holding a press conference to discuss the launch of auto-captions.  YouTube Director of Product Management Hunter Walk kicked off the event by discussing some of YouTube&#8217;s goals through the years â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0one of which is accessibility.Walk said that a few years ago, accessibility meant giving users more ways to access their content (for example, through their mobile phones).  Now, the company is focusing more on making its content accessible to even more people. Google software engineer Ken Harrenstein then took the stage to walk through some of YouTube&#8217;s initiatives on this front.Harrenstein walked us through YouTube&#8217;s past feature launches, including the launch of captions and subtitles. In November of last year, the company began to roll out auto-captions on a limited scale, which use speech recognition to automatically transcribe what&#8217;s said in a video.  And now, it&#8217;s going to enable the feature for all videos uploaded to YouTube where English is spoken.This makes the videos accessible not just to deaf people, but also to viewers around the world, who can translate any video that&#8217;s in English to another language.  However, Harrenstein took time to point out that the captioning isn&#8217;t perfect, showing how the words &#8220;SIM card&#8221; got transcribed to &#8220;salmon&#8221;.Here are some of the details for uploading videos:While we plan to broaden the feature to include more languages in the months to come, currently, auto-captioning is only for videos where English is spoken.Just like any speech recognition application, auto-captions require a clearly spoken audio track. Videos with background noise or a muffled voice can&#8217;t be auto-captioned. President Obama&#8217;s speech on the recent Chilean Earthquake is a good example of the kind of audio that works for auto-captions.Auto-captions aren&#8217;t perfect and just like any other transcription, the owner of the video needs to check to make sure they&#8217;re accurate. In other cases, the audio file may not be good enough to generate auto-captions. But please be patient &#8212; our speech recognition technology gets better every day.Auto-captions should be available to everyone who&#8217;s interested in using them. We&#8217;re also working to provide auto-captions for all past user uploads that fit the above mentioned requirements. If you&#8217;re having trouble enabling them for your video, please visit our Help Center here.Google researcher Mike Cohen then took the stage to talk about Google&#8217;s Speech Technology.  The ultimate vision, he says, is to provide accurate captions for all videos in all languages.  But that comes with many problems, including a massive vocabulary, issues with poor recordings and background noise, and accents.  And every language comes with its own unique challenges.YouTube hasn&#8217;t yet run all of its videos through the new transcription service, but video owners will be able to manually request that their older videos get transcribed more quickly through each video&#8217;s options screen.Harrenstein, who is deaf, retook the stage to tell a personal story.  When he was at MIT, he didn&#8217;t go to many of his lectures because he was unable to understand the lectures (which weren&#8217;t signed).  Now, he can watch MIT lectures on YouTube, with captioning enabled.  Next, some students from the California School for the Deaf in Fremont, and their instructor Joey Baer, took the stage to thank YouTube for the launch.  Check out their enthusiasm in the video below.  Really, this is quite amazing.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Many of us take the disaster readiness of servers and data centers for granted. But for IT admins from both small and large companies, being prepared for disaster and emergency situations is complicated and expensive issue. Google has made an announcement today for any enterprise users of Google Apps; assuring IT admins that the suite is now fully prepared for disaster recovery.  Rajen Sheth, Senior Product Manager, Google Apps, tells us that as of recently, Google is prepared for disaster recovery for all of its products in the Google Apps suite, which include Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sites, Google Calendar, Google Talk and Google Video. Google&#8217;s secret sauce is live and synchronous replication. So every action you take in Gmail is immediately replicated in two data centers at once, so that if one data center fails, Google will transfer data over to the other one. Traditionally, Google says, synchronous replication can be very expensive for companies. For example, the cost to back up 25GB of data with synchronous replication can range from $150 to $500+ in storage and maintenance costs per employee. Google says that exact price depends on a number of factors such as the number of times the data is replicated and the choice of service provider. Of course, Google replicates all the data multiple times, and the 25GB per employee for Gmail is backed up for free.  And data from Google Docs, Google Sites, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Talk and Google Video, which encompass most of the applications in Google Apps, is also synchronously replicated for free. The reason that Google can offer these services for free is because the tech giant already operates large data centers simultaneously for millions of users and also balances loads between data centers as needed.  Google also claims that its high speed connections between data centers allows the company to replicate and transfer large amounts of data quickly from one server to another. Google says synchronous replication is a more attractive option than the common practice that many small businesses take by backing up email by copying the data to a tape on a weekly or daily basis, which seems to be an arduous task. Larger companies opt for a storage area network (SAN) to back up data, which Google says is an expensive process. Sheth declined to identify the timeline of when each app began to use the backup solution. Sheth did say that bringing all the apps together into replication was a complex process. Google Apps is currently being used by 2 million businesses with 20 million active users. Photo Credit/Flickr/ClayIrvingCrunchBase Information',\n",

In this guest post he argues that the fragmentation of mobile devices and platforms is here to stay, and offers some advice to entrepreneurs on how to deal with it.Mobile data is on fire. Despite a few false starts, we are now in the midst of a transformative &#8220;Open Mobile 3rd Wave&#8221; (remember WAP, and J2ME?).  We are just in the early swell of the wave; the iPhone itself is not even three years old, and thanks to continued improvements weâ\\x80\\x99re now seeing in smart phones, mobile OS platforms and 3G/4G networks, the raw ingredients are just getting better every month.  Per the views of many mobile denizens and thought-leaders such as well-known internet analyst Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley, I certainly believe there will emerge new industry-transforming Facebooks, Googles, and Yahoos in this mobile wave.FRAGMENTATION &amp; COMPLEXITYHowever, a key topic discussed by us mobile geeks and startups is the challenge of mobile platform fragmentation. There is an alphabet soup of protocols, standards, and regional differences by country which can be daunting for any entrepreneur. Just look at the range of technologies on handset platforms alone, from iPhone to Android to Blackberry, and even new platforms announced in last 30 days, from WinMo7, to MeeGo, to Samsung Bada, as if we need more platforms to deal with . . .THE MAGIC BULLETâ\\x80\\x94IT DOESNâ\\x80\\x99T EXISTOne of the worst myths floating around the blogosphere is the wait by some for a &#8220;unifying technology&#8221; that will make things &#8220;simpler and easier&#8221; to develop services and apps for the global mobile market. Â\\xa0At times, some have claimed that Java (J2ME) was the answer, then Flash Lite, then Webkit browsers, and most recently HTML5.  While each solution has its merits, there will not be any unification anytime soon.  Even as HTML5 richness has improved substantially, browser support will still vary and many, many phones will not support HTML5 for 7+ years.Anyone who is waiting for a single silver bullet to solve fragmentation issues in mobile will be waiting a very long time, especially if they want to go after the global mobile opportunity. As such, it is important for mobile entrepreneurs to wade in and sort it out for themselves. Â\\xa0No one is going to flatten the industry such as Microsoft did in the PC-era to make it simple.THE REALPOLITIK: COMMON STANDARDS Â\\xa0= COMMODITY STANDARDS FOR MANYThe realpolitik is that Mobile is truly global, and serves an extremely wide range of countries and users.  There will naturally be a wide breadth of technologies, from CDMA vs GSM protocols, J2ME vs BREW,  Mobile Apps vs Mobile Web, xHTML vs HDML, SMS vs MMS and others to serve this market.Ask former execs of PSINet (bankrupt operator), AST (bankrupt PC maker) &amp; Packard Bell (bankrupt PC maker) about the impact of the WINTEL &#8220;standard&#8221; on other PC industry players, and you&#8217;ll get a sense why Nokia, Motorola,Verizon, &amp; Sprint aren&#8217;t rushing to follow their PC-era predecessors.  Common standards = commodity standards for many players in this industry.   Sadly, whether or not there is an elegant technical answer, it will be hard to drive any single set of worldwide standards given the different economic incentives of the many players, however good it would be for developers.OK, SO AS A MOBILE ENTREPRENEUR WHAT DO YOU DO? What do you do as a mobile entrepreneur in the face of this complexity? Â\\xa0If you&#8217;re going to be successful, the winning entrepreneurs in mobile will have to learn to navigate these waters. Â\\xa0Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no simple shortcut. Several thoughts:Don&#8217;t wait for the Magic Bullet. Â\\xa0The first step towards progress is acceptance of reality.  I actually do believe that Webkit browsers, HTML5, continued progression of J2ME, Android and iPhone are all positive trends that will help make things easier for many developers, but none of them will be a single-threaded answer.  There are too many markets where these solutions are insufficient.  For example, India, one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing mobile markets is stilldominated by Nokia, which hasÂ\\xa070%+ market share.  I donâ\\x80\\x99t think developing only for iPhones will be enough to dominate the India market given their &lt; 5% share.Bound The Problem &amp; Get Down the User Learning Curve. Â\\xa0So, the critical next step is to limit the boundaries of the problem so you can actually solve it.  Are you pursuing an enterprise app or a consumer app?  Does your success require broad scale viral use, or is it perfectly good to have 2000 profitable users? Many developers focused on the consumer market are going to find that a blend of mobile web, and prototyping on iPhone-only or Android-only is the right first step and only then expand to broader platforms.  Blackberry and WindowsMobile are similarly important in business applications.  Rather than the costly efforts of chasing 4-5 platforms at once, focus in on the first one or two, prove your model, then expanding will help to bound the complexity.Geography matters. That said, it turns out that there are major differences by country in the mobile ecosystem.  Just as important as the use case, is which country/geography one is targeting first.  In Europe, 3rd party retailers such as Carphone Warehouse play a major role, reducing the influence of operator controlled stores.  In emerging markets, Nokia is still a major force to be reckoned with.  In North America, iPhone is capturing a disproportionate profit share of the industry.

       "  'comments_content': 'More and more apps are stricken from the App Store as of late, for a variety of reasons. Today, the Apple hammer hit Tokyo-based Tonchidot whose augmented reality app Sekai Camera was removed without warning.The free app, which made its &#8211; memorable &#8211; debut during TechCrunch 50 in 2008, intends to help users &#8220;tag the world&#8221; by imposing information (text, pictures, video and audio) over images in the iPhone camera.Sekai Camera uses GPS to locate the user and measure the distance to objects in the vicinity. The problem for Apple: in places with weak GPS signals (i.e. within buildings or underground), the app relies on PlaceEngine, a technology that makes it possible to determine a user&#8217;s location via Wi-Fi. Once it&#8217;s installed on a device, the PlaceEngine client collects Wi-Fi signals from nearby access points and sends the information to a server, which then estimates your location.PlaceEngine provider Koozyt says on its Japanese website Apple changed their policy regarding &#8220;the way apps access Wi-Fi devices&#8221;. Not only Sekai Camera, but a number of other PlaceEngine-powered apps were kicked out, too (including Yahoo! Maps for the iPhone). Details are still unclear at this point, with Koozyt saying they are currently looking into the issue.More information on the peculiar ban are available at The Register.Tonchidot itself cites &#8220;issues regarding the App Store review process&#8221; as a reason for the ban of Sekai Camera version 2.1.1, adding the app will make a comeback in version 2.2 &#8220;soon&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t be too surprised to see PlaceEngine get scrapped altogether.In Japan, Sekai Camera is the most downloaded iPhone app to date, and it was elected â\\x80\\x9cBest App in 2009â\\x80³ by Apple Japan late last year (it was released worldwide in December).We reached out to Tonchidot for a comment and will update this post when we have it.Update with Tonchidot&#8217;s response (edited):We have also received sympathetic words from many people across theworld, and really appreciate everyone&#8217;s support.We always strive to comply with Apple&#8217;s policies, and will fix andresubmit a version that satisfies their current requirements. Â\\xa0We donot know what the exact reason is for their recent decision, butKoozyt, among others, have been extremely helpful in helping usidentify the potential cause.No worries, will will have a new and better version back up on AppStore very soon, so please look forward to it !  Go Koozyt! Go Sekai Camera!CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Right around the time the world&#8217;s financial markets started to collapse, back in 2008, RealNetworks, the folks behind RealPlayer, released RealDVD. It was a short-lived piece of software that made making DVD movie backups fairly painless&mdash;too painless for Hollywood, which immediately took RealNetworks to court, claiming all sorts of copyright infringement hokum. That&#8217;s all in the past now, for RealNetworks has settled with the six &#8220;major&#8221; Hollywood studios to the sum of $4.5 million. Ouch.The deal sees RealNetworks, yes, cough up $4.5 million for &#8220;costs and fees in connection with the litigation.&#8221; Some deal: you bring someone else to court, then make them pay all your bills. RealNetworks will also stop supporting RealDVD, and is in the process of refunding the purchase price to the 2,700 people who bought the thing.The company&#8217;s statement is sad:We are pleased to put this litigation behind us. This is another step toward fulfilling our commitment to simplify our company and focus on our core businesses.  Until this dispute, Real had always enjoyed a productive working relationship with Hollywood.  With this litigation resolved, I hope that in the future we can find mutually beneficial ways to use Real technology to bring Hollywood&#8217;s great work to consumers.&#8220;Core business&#8221;? Hasn&#8217;t Flash (and hopefully HTML5) made RealVideo irrelevant? I liked RealDVD, if only because it demonstrated quite clearly that Hollywood has no intention of letting you use the items you buy for your own ends. DVDs copied using RealDVD could only be played on that computer where it was ripped. It&#8217;s not like I could have borrowed Doug&#8217;s copy of Movie, then shared the resulting file with the other guys or anything.The point is, RealDVD is now dead as disco, but RealNetworks may have earned itself a little bit of geek cred in trying to stand up to big, bad Hollywood.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Joost, the failed video venture started by Skype founders Janus Friis and Niklas ZennstrÃ¶m, was put out of its misery in November 2009 when Adconion Media Group decided to pick up the remains of the company for an undisclosed sum.Today, the international audience and content network operator is launching a suite of online video advertising products and services, targeting agencies and brand marketers who might be interested in running in-banner and in-stream video advertising on the Joost Video Network.Video destination site Joost.com, meanwhile, will remain up and running (gotta love that &#8216;beta&#8217; tagged logo) and will be used as a portal to showcase and distribute branded entertainment content.Here&#8217;s how Nick Higgins, director of global video at Adconion, pitches the new offering:&#8220;Adding this product offering gives Adconion a distinguished position among ad networks, as we are the only provider with in-banner and in-stream capabilities; an exclusive relationship with a branded entertainment studio; in-house creative services; and a video portal, Joost.com, that we own, operate and sell exclusively.â\\x80\\x9dAdconion stresses that this is the first product from the combined entity formed when Adconion acquired Joostâ\\x80\\x99s assets. Since then, Adconion has integrated its ad server with the Joost video player and is the exclusive video ad provider for Joost.com and the Joost video player in its embedded form. Adconion also touts its exclusive relationship with the RedLever studio for the content side of the equation. The two companies say that will work with agencies and marketers to develop fresh content, from advertisements to webisodes.According to the press release, the Joost Video Network will serve video ads on Adconionâ\\x80\\x99s network, which self-reportedly spans 2,000 premium publishers in more than 70 markets worldwide. Adconion claims it is capable of reaching more than 350 million unique users across the globe. All in all, it seems like Adconion made a good move by throwing Joost a lifeline, though I&#8217;d love to know what they ended up paying for the assets of the massively hyped venture.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'One of the advantages of having a plethora of app directories for iPhone and Android devices, is the wealth of additional  data that has emerged regarding users buying and downloading habits. Facebook-based app directory mPlayit has a few compelling stats out today that show that games are four times as popular among iPhone users than among the Android user base. BlackBerry users are twice as likely to be looking for games content than Android users, eventhough BlackBerry devices are primarily used for business purposes. According to mPlayit, 83 percent of Android app activity on the directory/store is related to non-game related mobile apps, and 17 percent of activity is towards downloading and checking out games. On the other hand, 36 percent of iPhone app activity is related to non-game related mobile apps, with 64 percent of activity towards gaming on the device. Other trends identified by mPlayit include the massive growth of location-based apps, with Loopt, Foursquare and Gowalla all receiving attention on the directory by users. But mPlayit says that even lesser known location-based apps such as FastMall and AroundMe on iPhone are receiving an increased number of downloads. Evernote continues to dominate on the Android, iPhone and BlackBerry platforms, in the Lists &amp; Notes category. Barcode-scanning apps are also increasingly popular, holding the top Utilities category slot for iPhone and BlackBerry, and the second Shopping category slot for Android and iPhone.The fact that that Android platform doesn&#8217;t support  gaming as well as the iPhone is not new. But with the introduction of powerful Android devices such as Motorola&#8217;s Droid and most recently, Google&#8217;s Nexus 1, gaming apps and functionality has improved on the device. Especially now that both devices have multi-touch technology. That being said, it may take a bit longer for both developers and users to catch on. MPlayit /2009/11/18/myplayit-launches-mobile-app-discovery-directory-on-facebook/&#8221;&gt;launched its Facebook app that allows users to discover, share and recommend a variety of mobile apps back in November and covers apps available for the iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Mobile (Java) devices. Mplayitâ\\x80\\x99s directory of apps includes a dedicated page for each app where Mplayit will post videos of the app (created either by the developer or pulled from YouTube), a detailed description of the app and reviews. You can also click to buy the app from various app markets, including Apple&#8217;s App Store and the Android Market.

The startup gives publishers access to affiliate programs of thousands of merchants across a number of affiliate networks. Each time a user clicks through and makes a purchase, the website earns a commission from the retailer. With Skimlinks, a publisher can set which links should be affiliate ones or not. The publishers makes money from content via affiliate fees and Skimlinks takes a 25% cut of the commissions. Today, the startup is launching a nifty discovery tool for publishers to search for affiliate links by keyword.The desktop tool, called a Skimkit, is powered by Adobe AIR and is essentially a live searchable database of millions of products from Skimlinks merchants. The tool lets publishers research, find and link to products they are writing about, with immediate access to deeplinks and image URLs.So, If a website publisher is searching for a link for red shoes, the user can search for red shoes on the Skimbit. The startup will produce results from retailers who have affiliate programs for links. SkimKit also features a service that creates shortened, monetized links for use in Twitter and email newsletters. SkimKit is available for free to Skimlinks publishers.Skimlinks, which was born from Skimbit, is already being uses as a monetization service on more than a half million sites worldwide and has raised a total of $2.5 million in funding.

A month later, they ensured the move wasn&#8217;t taken as a joke or gimmick by launching another app, Tag, into Apple&#8217;s App Store. Now, they have a few, including an app for Bing. And starting today, they&#8217;re doing the same for Android.Tag for Android is the first Microsoft-made app launched on the mobile platform. This is notable, of course, because Android is the mobile platform by Microsoft&#8217;s chief rival: Google. Still, as we saw with the iPhone, Microsoft has no problems getting its technology out there, even if it means using rival platforms. Aside from Android and iPhone, Tag also currently works on Windows Mobile, J2ME, Blackberry and Symbian S60 phones.Microsoft&#8217;s Tag technology allows you to use your phone as a mobile barcode reader. You simply point your phone&#8217;s camera at a tag (think: a smaller QRCode), snap a picture, and the Tag program will interpret it. This can be used to place things like coupons in physical locations, for example. Other companies, including Google, are working on these mobile barcodes as well. In fact, just prior to the Nexus One unveiling, all Google employees were given the device with a special barcode on the back that other Android devices could scan to get that person&#8217;s information.Despite the high level on animosity between Microsoft and Google, it&#8217;s great to see that Microsoft isn&#8217;t above creating apps for the increasingly popular Android platform. Microsoft made its own big mobile headlines last month with the unveiling of Windows Phone Series 7, a complete reboot of its mobile strategy, due to launch later this year. That move should help Microsoft better compete with the current hot mobile platforms, Android and the iPhone.The Tag application is available today in the Android Market; it&#8217;s a free app.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It will also be sold through Apple&#8217;s online store. VeriFone CEO Doug Bergeron disclosed this information during VeriFone&#8217;s conference call yesterday afternoon.Obviously, this placement could potentially mean a lot for VeriFone. It&#8217;s one thing to advertise your product, and say you can buy it online, it&#8217;s another to say you can go to an Apple Store and pick up the entire package in one fell-swoop (iPhone + PAYware Mobile reader). Bergeron also noted that the company plans to introduce PAYware mobile editions for Android, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile. While Square is also currently iPhone (or iPod touch)-only, the card reader itself was made to plug into a headphone jack so it should work on a variety of mobile platforms eventually.Square, while yet to formally launch, is currently being tested by a number of partners. We&#8217;ve used it a few times to accept donations, and have been very pleased with the results. PAYware Mobile also seems pretty solid. This should be an interesting battle.Here&#8217;s the key parts from Bergeron&#8217;s comments:Letâ\\x80\\x99s move on now to our PAYware mobile initiative. The iPhone version of this complete end-to-end payment solution comprise of a VeriShield Protect-enabled card encryption sleeve, an Apple-certified software app, and payment gateway service, commenced shipment in the last week of January. Channel development is key to this initiativeâ\\x80\\x99s success. To better reach individual and small business end users, we have launched a highly-effective marketing campaign that has garnered the attention of the national press, including Newsweek, CNN Money, and Fox Business news. We have also made progress in working with our traditional processor and financial institution partners to support this initiative and we will be making key announcement shortly.In addition, we have established PAYware mobile gateway processing relationships with over 70 ISOs to-date, allowing them to assist existing or new (inaudible) customers in processing payment via the iPhone. Finally, and importantly, customers will also be able to purchase our PAYware mobile solution through ourÂ\\xa0paywaremobile.comdirect sales site, which provide â\\x80\\x93 which forwards transactions to one of five blue-chip processors. And starting in March, at Apple Retail Stores in the United States and the Apple Business Store online.At the same time, we are also targeting large national, international party and in-home direct sales enterprises who may have already been outfitted with iPhones. Integrating secure, card present payments into these existing applications across hundreds of thousands of users is the next logical step. Later this year, we intend to deliver an EMV pin based version of PAYware mobile for the iPhone, allowing us to meet payment need for iPhone users worldwide. We are also planning to introduce PAYware mobile edition for Android, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Late last year, we published a list of the top 10 IPO candidates of 2010. Â\\xa0Leading that list was Facebook, which has grown to 400 million users and is finally starting to turn on the revenue pumps as it works toward its inevitable IPO.  But this evening, the Wall Street Journal published an article penned by Jessica Vascellaro that may dash the hopes of anyone who thinks that will happen in the immediate future. The lengthy piece, which is well worth reading in its entirety, touches on quite a few issues related to Facebook&#8217;s history and its future, and largely revolves around CEO Mark Zuckerberg â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0who doesn&#8217;t sound all that keen to take his company public.While the article covers a lot of familiar territory about Facebook&#8217;s past, there&#8217;s plenty of new information too.  Of note, the article says that Facebook executives have &#8220;discussed how revenues for 2010 could hit between $1.2 to $2 billion&#8221; â\\x80\\x94 figures that exceed even the $1.1 billion InsideFacebook&#8217;s Eric Eldon reported yesterday (clearly, the number is looking big). The article also asserts that Facebook is working on a tool for sharing your physical location with Facebook (something that we&#8217;ve been hearing about for quite a while, and that I believe will be key in the future).With regard to Facebook&#8217;s IPO, the article discusses Zuckerberg&#8217;s penchant for &#8220;delayed gratification&#8221;, which he says he has a special capacity for. Â\\xa0And because Zuckerberg still maintains firm control over the company, and when it will IPO, delayed gratification seems to be the law of the land.There are also a handful of interesting anecdotes about Zuckerberg. According to the article, a Facebook engineer once wrote an internal memo called &#8220;Working With Zuck&#8221;, in which he warned other employees not to hope for much in the way of back-patting from their CEO, explaining they should not &#8220;expect acknowledgment for your role in moving the discussion forward; getting the product right should be its own reward.&#8221;CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Kwedit, the innovative new alternate payment product for social games and just about any other virtual good, is on a roll. They&#8217;ve raised a second round of financing &#8211; $3.3 million in a round led by Maveron. And they were also on the Colbert Report last night. Just, not so much in a good way.Colbert ridiculed the company as a &#8220;website that hooks little kids on borrowing credit.&#8221; You can watch the clip here.One of Kwedit&#8217;s products is a sort of credit system. Users promise to pay back the Kwedit, and social game gives in game currency based on that promise. There&#8217;s no enforcement mechanism if the user doesn&#8217;t pay, other than a lower Kwedit score and difficulty in getting more in game Kwedit. See our overview here.So while the Colbert clip is funny, it&#8217;s not very accurate. The company says that they absolutely do not encourage use by young children. You must be at least 13 to use Kwedit. And while Kwedit teaches users how to use credit, it&#8217;s not actually a credit product. The credit business is about charging interest over time, ideally on balances that are never fully paid off. There is no interest in Kwedit.Kwedit says they&#8217;ve signed six new merchant contracts since launch across a variety of verticals. PokeTalk, a VoIP provider, is among them, as well as a MMO, a test prep service and a credit record protection service.PokeTalk is using the Kwedit Direct product, which allows users to agree to pay for something online and then pay for the item by mailing in cash, or by going to a local 7-11 and paying there. Pre-paid cards also require a big up front investment in printing and distribution to get up and running.Some of Kwedit&#8217;s partners seem to be very interested in that 7-11 angle. It&#8217;s very hard to get any kind of presence in those stores, but they can get in immediately by using Kwedit. In fact, says the company, they are seeing &#8220;tremendous interest&#8221; in the Kwedit Direct product.Kwedit also says that they can enable charitable donations via Kwedit Direct, and neither they nor 7-11 will charge any fees for these payments. So charities looking for a new way to accept payments will likely give this a look.As I said in our launch post, I&#8217;m very intrigued by Kwedit. It&#8217;s the only truly unique payment product I&#8217;ve seen recently and has a real chance of helping social gaming companies and other virtual goods companies increase revenue per customer in a world where only 1-3% of users are willing to open their wallet. Colbert may joke about it, but Kwedit is, actually, serious business.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Android users have a new way to search their phones today, and it&#8217;s pretty damn cool.  Google has just released a new application called Gesture Search that lets you search your phone&#8217;s contacts, bookmarks, applications, and music simply by scribbling out letters with your finger.  No hunting and pecking â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you just draw out each letter as if you&#8217;re finger painting. The new application is currently only available for devices running Eclair (Android 2.0, which is currently only found on the Nexus One and Verizon Droid).Using Gesture Search is quite simple.  First, you boot up the Gesture Search application, which you need to download from Android Market.  After installing it, your phone will prompt you to ask if you want to add the application to your home screen (which you&#8217;ll probably want to do if you intend to use it with any frequency). Tap the application, and you&#8217;ll see a black screen, where you&#8217;re supposed to start drawing the first few letters of your query. As you complete each letter, the application will refine your results. If you mess up, you can delete the last letter by drawing a horizontal line to the left (you can delete the entire word by swiping to the right).I&#8217;ve been playing with the new application, and the character recognition seems to work pretty well.  It&#8217;s still too early to tell how useful this will be on a day-to-day basis, but it has potential.  For one, it&#8217;s great for people who don&#8217;t like having to flick through long lists or use the phone&#8217;s integrated keyboard.  And because everyone knows how to draw these letters by heart, it makes for a good way to search when you can&#8217;t keep your eyes on your phone (don&#8217;t take this as a recommendation to use it while driving, though â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0that&#8217;s never safe).CrunchBase Information',\n",

A completely revamped version of the Facebook application has just gone live in the Palm App Catalog &#8211; and boy, is it an improvement.Palm has offered some level of Facebook support on webOS since the launch of the Pixi &#8211; but as we noted in our Pixi review, calling what it had &#8220;Facebook support&#8221; was probably exaggerating. You could sync your Facebook contacts, read your news feed, and.. well, that&#8217;s it.The new app seems much more properly endowed, offering up access to your news feed (with full liking/commenting support), full profiles, people search, photo albums, inbox, events, photo uploading, and more. And of course, it&#8217;s still fully intertwined with webOS&#8217; Synergy system, allowing the user to automatically sync Facebook friends to their relative contacts, complete with profile pictures as caller ID photos.We&#8217;re just cracking this app open for the first time right this second, but it certainly seems like the fully featured Facebook app that webOS deserves.Update: Added a few screenshots below!Update #2 Some people are reporting that the application in the App Catalog is still the old version.

       "  'comments_content': 'Valve is in the midst of a media blitz at the moment &mdash; not that you&#8217;d notice, since their idea of a media blitz is secretly launching a complex alternate reality game, or emailing single novelty screenshots to six different media outlets. You could be forgiven for expecting a full-site skin for 1UP, or a week-long series of &#8220;developer diaries&#8221; on IGN &mdash; that&#8217;s what every other game company out there thinks makes games sell. At any rate, GDC is coming up and the expected announcements are Steam on OS X (definite) and possibly a peek at Portal 2, Half-Life: Episode 3, or both (speculative).Of course, the idea of Steam on the Mac causes a delicate froth to appear on the lips of several kinds of fanboys &mdash; but while an excellent game-distribution client like Steam would be welcome on the Mac, it may not be the gaming renaissance people are hoping for. It&#8217;s worth taking a bit of time to look at, since gaming is increasingly a major source of revenue and a wedge to increase market share. Let&#8217;s take a look at what Steam is up against.Digital distribution on Mac is standardUnlike the majority of games and programs for Windows, Mac apps are frequently distributed whole, with a nag screen and 30-day limit or the like &mdash; shareware, essentially. This has been the standard for as long as I can remember; one example I&#8217;m sure many readers recall fondly is Escape Velocity, the demo for which was practically the whole game, except that once you passed the 30-day trial period, a rogue fighter ship piloted by one &#8220;Cap&#8217;n Hector&#8221; would harass you and steal your credits (the scoundrel). A more modern equivalent would be the ability to download, say, the Aperture 3 trial and instantly convert it to the full version by entering a license key. Add in the faultless update system in OS X (compare with XP&#8217;s monstrous Windows Update), and it&#8217;s clear that Mac users have less to gain, and more to expect, from a digital distribution platform on their OS. They take Steam&#8217;s biggest selling point for granted to begin with.That can, of course, go both ways. One could argue that Steam is a natural fit for OS X, since digital distribution and automatic updates are so very Mac-ish, but users will also tend to reject non-Apple programs that perform Apple-like duties. &#8220;Apple does it better,&#8221; they&#8217;ll say, and they&#8217;re probably right, since Apple made the OS. On that note:Steam doesn&#8217;t really fit in well with OS XThis may sound like a superficial complaint, but no one has yet successfully overestimated the superficiality of Mac users. On Windows, I&#8217;m resigned to the constant interface changes: applications with hard-coded Vista-style buttons, flash-like interfaces, or ugly (but functional) open-source programs that look like they just stepped out of Windows 95. Steam is far from ugly, but it is a custom UI, with different spacing for buttons, and an embedded browser that until recently was IE-based, and a number of other issues. Sure, it works, and it doesn&#8217;t look bad, but can you think of how out-of-place it might look on a Mac? GUI consistency is not just pretty, it&#8217;s functional. And that consistency has always been one of OS X&#8217;s strengths (notwithstanding the occasional overlap, like Marble in Aperture and whatever-it&#8217;s-called in iTunes).It&#8217;s an objection which could be overcome by Valve, but they&#8217;ve invested in the Steam look (it&#8217;s deliberately and irreversibly associated with Valve&#8217;s branding) and haven&#8217;t made too many concessions to Windows. So while they&#8217;re capable of making it look right, I don&#8217;t know that they have any inclination to do so. And that&#8217;s something which will rankle the design-conscious masses of Mac users.If a gamer on the Mac (ahem) really wanted to do it right, anyway, there are tools in place. I wrote about the launch of GamersGate&#8217;s Mac store, which I&#8217;ve used and found perfectly convenient. Its web-based interface means no commitment, but also no sweet features. Still, it&#8217;s something to add into the discussion stew we&#8217;re brewing here. I asked their opinion on Steam for OS X; their CEO said they were &#8220;glad that more people are entering the space and our hope is that more publishers will follow suit by releasing more titles that are Mac compatible.&#8221; You and me both, guy.Really now: there aren&#8217;t many games for the MacI suspect there will be some resistance to this point, but it&#8217;s kind of a throwaway since the next one is more important anyway. But let&#8217;s be honest here. There aren&#8217;t a hell of a lot of good games on OS X. At best you get big titles a year or two late, if you get them at all. 9 out of 10 games on the Mac are colorful casual games, point-and-click adventures, and the occasional inexplicably cross-platform indie game. I&#8217;m not saying there aren&#8217;t any good games coming out, but lord, they ain&#8217;t coming down like autumn leaves, that&#8217;s for damn sure. Here&#8217;s a list of Steam games with a native Mac port. Not pretty, and as commenter Scott notes, there&#8217;s no guarantee any of these games will launch with Steam OS X, though we can hope.And we&#8217;re okay with that. Apple hasn&#8217;t recovered as a gaming platform since the Great Halo Betrayal of 2000, and as some great rhetorician said, &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you, fool me &#8211; you can&#8217;t get fooled again.&#8221; How true. But maybe Steam would bring a new enthusiasm to the Mac gaming community, right? Don&#8217;t be so sure. Valve has reported that it has approached Apple many times but seen no real accommodation on their side. It takes two, you know. And when your partner is busy eying that sexy tablet form factor across the room&#8230; you might find:OS X is no longer the platform Apple cares about for gamingIf Apple has dropped the ball on PC-like gaming (FPSes and all that), it&#8217;s led the game in the casual/mobile sector. Although I wrote some time ago that Nintendo has little to fear from Apple in that area, I by no means meant to suggest that Apple was anything but a success in the mobile games world. My argument was, in fact, that games were far more successful than Apple could have guessed, and that was why they were only now starting to push them. But Apple is smart enough to pick its battles, and it needs to get into the desktop gaming business right now like it needs to get into the llama farming business.It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of faith to see that the iPad and next iPhone are going to have gaming as one of their primary foci (focuses?). What better use for the perfectly capable 3D graphics chip they&#8217;ve got in there? Recent investigation shows more similarity between the iPad and iPhone 3GS than previously supposed, so it&#8217;s likely that there will be a significant overlap in releases. Hardware and code base homogeneity is a huge advantage for games developers, and I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll see a nice blossoming of seriously cool games once the iPad hits and a value proposition is settled on.Where does that leave OS X? Out in the cold, obviously. Sure, Apple wants people to buy games for it, that&#8217;s money in their pocket. But there&#8217;s a lot more money to be made in iPhone and iPad gaming because they can leverage the App Store, against which Steam is powerless. Now, if Steam were to run on the iPhone too, that&#8217;d be insane, but I guarantee Apple would rather eat glass than have a powerful alternative to the App Store catering to a market they&#8217;re just starting to exploit.Even with all that I&#8217;ve said here, I&#8217;m still excited. The announcement, expected to be next Thursday (Valve&#8217;s Gabe Newell is scheduled to speak), could be a lot more or a lot less than what we expect. The Orange Box for Mac? Don&#8217;t get your hopes up. But when Valve does something like this (especially with such a crazy run-up as they&#8217;re doing), you can bet they don&#8217;t do things by halves. There&#8217;s more care taken in this teaser image (via RPS; the rest are at MacRumors) We&#8217;ll report the goings-on as soon as they occur, so point your browsers this way next week for that and all the rest of our GDC coverage.Update: Added Caruso comic (not my joke)',\n",

Scribd&#8217;s biggest competitor DocStoc is also growing at a nice clip and adding new features at a steady clip.Scribd is also making a big push into mobile reading by making it easy to send documents to avariety of mobile devices, including iPhones, Android phones, Blackberries, Kindles, and Nooks.

       "  'comments_content': 'Personalized search is something that we all know Google feels strongly about. Today, the search giant is adding a new feature to help users mark searches: Stars. So when you see search results, you can click to mark a star next to a result that you feel is relevant. The next time you perform a search relevant to a starred item, the result will appear in a special list right at the top of your results. The feature will be rolled out to users over the next few days and will be available to users who are signed into their Google accounts. Google says that stars will make it it easier for users to remember their favorite results because they don&#8217;t have to keep track of them after they star them. Google will essentially do all the heavy lifting by remembering starred items and presenting those results when appropriate. Stars sync with your Google Bookmarks and the Google Toolbar, so you can access your list of starred items in one place if you&#8217;d like to see them. Stars can also be used to mark pages when browsing the web; you can click the star icon in Toolbar to create a bookmark, which will show up in your starred items. Google says that stars in search will replace SearchWiki, a tool which we weren&#8217;t very fond of.  Searchwiki allowed users to customize search by re-ranking, deleting, adding, and commenting on search results. Apparently others felt the same way, because Google said that users disliked changing the order of Google&#8217;s &#8220;organic search results.&#8221; Stars appears to be an effort to personalize search results in a simpler way. Google notes that if you have been using SearchWiki, your edits will be preserved with your Google Account. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Apple and Google are engaged in a fascinating battle of mobile OS&#8217;s. Among other things, they&#8217;re duking it out on patent infringement, developer relations and carrier support. Lines are being drawn, and everyone&#8217;s taking sides.That begs the question: what&#8217;s the difference between the App Store and Android Market for developers? And how does this affect their bottom line? Mobclix, a TC50 Company, just released a report comparing the Android Market to Apple App Store. They are a mobile analytics and advertising platform whose footprint includes over 6,500 publishers including ngmoco, SGN, and NewToy (creators of Words with Friends).The data revealed that about 60% of Android apps are free of charge, compared with 20% for App Store applications. Furthermore, about 20% of Windows Mobile and Blackberry are free as well. It&#8217;s an intriguing phenomenon and a difficult one to decipher. Are Android developers more inclined to use advertising instead of direct payment to monetize? Or does the more democratic nature of the Android Market make free apps more successful?Another potential explanation is that Android doesn&#8217;t even allow paid apps in many countries, including Canada, China and India. That may be scaring developers off from the platform.Mobclix&#8217;s data also showed clear differences between average price of apps in the various stores. While Android and Apple have the largest number of apps, they are also the cheapest: the average paid Android app costs $4.10 and the average paid App Store app is $3.37. In comparison, WinMo apps average at $7.48 and BlackBerry at $8.58. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate into more revenue, but it does mean that the market dynamics of each store are causing different pricing options for developers.Vishal Gurbuxani, CTO and Co-Founder, also shared that Mobclix is nearing profitability and has served over 3.5 Billion ad impressions. By comparison, advertising network AdMob (recently acquired by Google) announced in November that they had served 1.7 Billion impressions by that date.Below is the full presentation, with more interesting data like a comparison of Android vs Apple across all categories (e.g. Books or News):',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last year we reported that MySpace founder and former CEO Chris DeWolfe was raising a big round of capital to start acquiring companies. He&#8217;s now closed on that round of capital and has made his first acquisition. He&#8217;s also &#8220;got the band back together&#8221; by bringing on a slew of former MySpace executives to help him with the new ventures.His company, called Platform G, has acquired MindJolt, a San Francisco based social gaming platform founded by Richard Fields. Austin Ventures is backing him financially with an initial injection of capital that is rumored to be in excess of $20 million. Chris Pacitti and Tom Ball from Austin Ventures have joined the Platform G board of directors, and the company is now renamed MindJolt as well.Joining DeWolfe is Chief Operating Officer Colin Digiaro (MySpaceâ\\x80\\x99s former head of Monetization and co-founder of SlingShot Labs), Chief Technology Officer Aber Whitcomb (MySpaceâ\\x80\\x99s former Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of MySpace), SVP of Business &amp; Corporate Development Josh Yguado (Former VP of Business Development at Fox Networks Group). Richard Fields is also staying with the company and heading up strategy.MindJolt has around 1,300 games from 1,000 third party developers. Those games are then distributed on Facebook and, more recently, MySpace. MindJolt makes revenue from advertising and splits it with those developers. But more importantly, those small developers get a huge platform for their games (19 million people a month play MindJolt games on Facebook alone). And usage is growing by as much as 7% per week. The company is profitable, although they won&#8217;t disclose revenues or other financial information.In the future, MindJolt says they will add additional monetization features, including virtual goods, and tools to help game developers build games as well.And the company is going to be making more acquisitions. From the beginning DeWolfe has said that he intends to execute a roll up strategy, and the company is clearly gearing up to buy more gaming companies. Austin Ventures is a good partner on this &#8211; the firm founded HomeAway, a rollup of home rental sites, and that company is worth well over $1 billion now.The company will remain headquartered in San Francisco and will open an office in Los Angeles as well. They are &#8220;hiring like crazy,&#8221; they say.Austin Ventures certainly isn&#8217;t being shy about dipping into the MySpace talent pool. Yesterday they backed a company that poached John Faith, until recently General Manager and Vice President of MySpace Mobile. I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s much talent left at MySpace people to steal, but more people will likely be heading for the exits shortly. Possibly to join DeWolfe at his shiny new startup.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Anyone who has bought a textbook, whether during college or graduate school, understands how expensive they can be. College textbook rental startup BookRenter is trying to make the process of buying textbooks more affordable through its online site which loans books to students for a fixed duration. Today, the startup is opening up its platform to other sites to allow any college or business to launch its own online textbook rental store. Competitors Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble College are pursuing similar partnerships.Partners, such as universities or campus bookstores, will be able to use BookRenter to set up a virtual store on their sites.  Partners have access to the same selection of textbooks available on BookRenter&#8217;s site (which are electronically sourced from the largest textbook supplier)s.  Partners can also use BookRenterâ\\x80\\x99s dynamic pricing engine, which updates textbook prices in real time by responding to shifts in market supply and demand, as well as its customer service support. And BookRenter offers partners analytics platform and on-demand reporting capabilities, to give them intelligence on what&#8217;s selling. BookRenter allows partners to take 8% of the rental price. The site currently has 3 million titles and and promises to rent books for 75% off the list price of the textbook. The expansion of BookRenter&#8217;s platform to other sites makes sense for the startup to expand its userbase. But, 8% is a low cut for a partner and many campus bookstores may see the rental platform as competition for their own textbook sales. BookRenter, which just raised $6 million in funding, faces competition from Barnes and Noble, Chegg, a heavily-funded player in the space (Chegg offers an affiliate API to partners). But BookRenter claims a competitive advantage over Chegg and others by offering more flexible loan schedules and faster delivery (they offer next-day delivery on many titles, and use UPS). Chegg and BookRenter recently got into a tussle over a trademark to the phrase &#8220;#1 In Textbook Rentals.â\\x80\\x9dCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last year at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, both Foursquare and Gowalla had their public unveilings. This year, with each rapidly gaining adopters (and mainstream interest), the two will likely battle it out for geolocation supremacy, along with a range of other competitors. And both Foursquare and Gowalla have already begun position themselves for the big battle.Gowalla Pretties UpA few days ago, Gowalla rolled out a completely redesigned website. Notably, the new main page features an easy-to-understand explanation of what the service is (check in, share with friends, enjoy rewards), as well as large icons to show users where to download the app on various mobile devices. It also features a &#8220;Live on Gowalla&#8221; continually updating stream of check-ins. And it has an area for &#8220;Featured spots.&#8221;Meanwhile, users&#8217; Passport pages (basically, your profile), have been revamped as well. Big icons show the spots you&#8217;ve visited, and you can also more easily see where your friends have recently been. It&#8217;s also more obvious when you have new friend requests, as the number you have are now badged in the &#8220;Friends&#8221; tab. In this tab, there is also an easier way to turn on and off push notifications if you have the iPhone app set up.Simply put, this updated site looks amazing. Gone are much of the dark green hues which many users found ugly (me included); they&#8217;ve been replaced by a &#8220;remixed&#8221; light green look. The site remains much prettier than its chief rival, Foursquare, and apparently there&#8217;s more changes comes. &#8220;This is part 1 of the redesign. There is much more to fix,&#8221; Gowalla co-founder Josh Williams notes on Twitter.Foursquare Adds FunctionalityMeanwhile, Foursquare isn&#8217;t content to rest on its quickly-expandingÂ\\xa0laurels. The site has just rolled out a new &#8220;categories&#8221; element to places. You can find this in the &#8220;History&#8221; area on the Foursquare website, as blogger Wes Novack notes. On this page, venues have a new question mark icon next to them and hovering over that will give you the option to assign the place to a category.Depending on the type of category, there may be multiple subcategories to better define what type of place the venue is. These category labels then show up on the individual venue pages on the Foursquare website, just above the Tag area.It&#8217;s not yet clear what exactly Foursquare plans to do with these categories, but an obvious answer is recommendations. For example, if you said you were looking for a wine bar close to your current location, with categories, Foursquare could easily serve that up. In that regard, it may be taking on Yelp more directly, after Yelp fired a shot across Foursquare&#8217;s bow earlier this year with the new check-in functionality (which Foursquare didn&#8217;t like too much).And this new feature is just part of the larger set of features Foursquare hopes to roll out in time for SXSW, which starts next week. When I asked co-founder Dennis Crowley about the new feature, he wrote, &#8220;it&#8217;ll make sense &#8211; trust me.&#8221;The BattleGowalla recently rolled out an updated version of its iPhone app (1.5), which doesn&#8217;t have many new features but promises to get users ready for the updates about to come. They also have an early version of their new Android app out in the wild. Meanwhile, Foursquare is said to be working on a new iPhone app in time for SXSW also. And that will undoubtedly take advantage of the new functionality being added.SXSW Interactive starts a week from Friday.[image: United Artists]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Uh oh.On at least a few occasions, Android developers have mentioned to me that the multi-touch sensors on certain Android handsets &#8212; especially the Nexus One &#8212; seemed a bit.. flaky. I&#8217;d had nothing but solid experiences while dabbling with multi-touch in all of the apps I could find that support it, so I chalked it up as a coding error on the developer&#8217;s part until something a bit more solid came forward.Well, something a bit more solid has just come forward.Our buddy Taylor Wimberly of AndroidAndMe was chatting with Robert Green of Battery Powered Games, who was reporting the same Nexus One multitouch sketchiness we&#8217;d heard of previously &#8211; but Robert had proof.Robert threw together a simple multi-touch application called Multitouch Visible Test. As the name implies, it makes your multitouch input visible by drawing large circles beneath your fingers wherever the phone thinks they are. It&#8217;s all pure sensor data right from the phone; there&#8217;s not any data processing going on here, so there&#8217;s not a whole lot of room for software bugs on Robert&#8217;s end.As you can see in the video below, the Motorola Droid seems to handle all of the default multitouch gestures with ease. The Nexus One, however, flounders; while it handles slow pinch-and-zoom motions just fine, it goes all kinds of crazy once your fingers get too close together. The output data gets flipped, reporting your fingers as being in the polar opposite locations of where they actually are.It&#8217;s somewhat understandable how this bug slipped through the cracks: for standard pinch-and-zoom behaviors, things would seem to behave correctly enough that the difference may not be noticeable. It&#8217;s a different story with games, however; imagine having to control two things on the screen at one time, and having said things mysteriously rocket off in the wrong direction because your fingers got too close together. Suck.It&#8217;s not a bug that&#8217;s likely to come up on a daily basis, but its not exactly trivial &#8211; and either way, a bug is a bug. If you have a drink tonight, cheers to the idea that this might be fixable with a software update.Have you ever noticed any multi-touch oddities on the Nexus One (or any other Android handset)?

The terms of the deal were not disclosed.Offbeat Creations has developed several popular apps on Facebook including Super Farkle. The acquisition will obviously boost Playdom&#8217;s presence on Facebook. The gaming company has largely been known as dominant on social network MySpace. Playdom&#8217;s lineup of games included Sorority Life, Mobsters 2, Lil Farm Life, Tiki Farm, Tiki Resort, Wild Ones and Poker Palace.Offbeat Creations&#8217; founders will join Playdom in leadership roles in Playdom&#8217;s Seattle offices. In November, Playdom raised a massive $43 million at a $260 million valuation. As we reported at that time, Playdom&#8217;s presence on MySpace was strong. Their Mob Wars game has 14 million or so users there, and the company was likely pulling in $60 million or more in revenue at that time. According to our stats from November, Playdom has 28 million monthly game users. 60% of traffic is from MySpace v. 40% from Facebook. They have twelve MySpace apps and 6 Facebook Apps. This acquisition should boost their number of Facebook apps. Offbeat Creations says that its games on Facebook currently exceed one million monthly users.

       "  'comments_content': 'All 10.5 million blogs on WordPress.com, including TechCrunch, just got more realtime.  Any blog hosted on WordPress is now PuSH-enabled, meaning that new posts get pushed out to feed readers such as Google Reader the second they are published.  There were WordPress plug-ins that did this before, but now WordPress is doing it automatically for all hosted blogs.PuSH stands for Pubsubhubbub, a realtime protocol designed to speed up RSS which launched at our first Realtime CrunchUp last year.  Instead of waiting for your RSS reader to ping the servers for each blog and news site you subscribe to, which can cause a noticeable delay before it actually shows up in your feed reader, it will now be pushed out immediately.  The PuSH protocol does away with the constant polling required by RSS.  Another way to speed up RSS is through a different protocol called RSSCloud, which WordPress also supports.  There are subtle differences between RSSCloud and PuSH, the most significant being that RSSCloud just notifies your feed reader there is something new, while PuSH actually sends the content with the notification via so-called fat pings.  Google Reader also supports PuSH, so if you use Google Reader, all WordPress blogs will be updated much faster than before.  Not that you&#8217;d necessarily notice unless you just came from a blog&#8217;s site or saw a link on Twitter, Facebook, Buzz or some other stream first.

       "  'comments_content': 'Excuse me while I let off a little steam. I was a tad hasty in myÂ\\xa0proclamationÂ\\xa0yesterday that the TiVo Premiere changes everything. It doesn&#8217;t. In fact, it doesn&#8217;t change anything. It&#8217;s a big pile ofÂ\\xa0disappointment and missed opportunity.TiVo doesn&#8217;t release hardware that often so when it does, it better be good. Tivos have a ridiculously long shelf life. The TiVo HD XL was their last hardware update and that came out in September 2008. That model just added the THX certification and increased the storage capacity over the TiVo HD, though, which launched in the Summer of 2007. Even then the UI they used was twice as old.Needless to say many TiVo fans were pumped about yesterday&#8217;s events. Our boxes were starting to get a little stale and at least I think most expected TiVo to take care of its loyal customer base like it has in the past. But that&#8217;s not going to happen. The Series4 TiVo Premiere UI is not getting pushed to Series3 hardware as we found out yesterday. It has something to do with the new Adobe Flash software requiring a dual-core chip or some nonsense like that.But then there&#8217;s the new hardware, too. In case you didn&#8217;t notice, the new hardware is almost exactly the same has the HD and HD XL models, besides the additional computing power to run the swanky Flash interface. They have the same measly 320GB and 1TB hard drive options as the previous models. Hard drives are cheap now and I can&#8217;t be the only that expected TiVo to out 1TB and 2TB options. I don&#8217;t even think you can buy a 320GB hard drive anymore.Arris had the right idea when it stuffed a third high-def tuner in its Moxi HD DVR, allowing the box to record three HD stations at one time. After all a single multistream CableCARD can handle six channels simultaneously. But alas, the TiVo Premiere only has two HD tuners.TiVo previously has always been great about treating its loyal subscribers with fresh UI updates. Even 5 to 7 year old boxes often got most of the new features when they rolled out. TiVo so far claims that the Series3 boxes cannot handle the 100% Flash UI, which could very well be true. So why then develop on such a resource-intensive platform? Other programs like Boxee and XBMC have shown the world that beautiful interfaces can be designed to run on even the most simple hardware.At least TiVoÂ\\xa0continuedÂ\\xa0toÂ\\xa0innovateÂ\\xa0in the remote market and turned its famous peanut remote into a QWERTY slider. There&#8217;s a lot to love there besides the fact that it&#8217;s not included and requires an additional dongle to work. No matter, we&#8217;ll take a QWERTY remote anyway we can get it.Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the new interface is wonderful. It&#8217;s just sad that TiVo clearly lost its way and forgot about its loyal customer base. They have to be loyal, too. Content provider DVRs offer the same basic functionality for a fraction of the price. But us TiVo owners actually spent hundreds to buy our DVRs and still pay a higher monthly fee than you can lease a DVR from a cable company. That&#8217;s because they offer a lot more features, a more pleasing user experience, and at least we thought they were backed by a customer-focused company. ThatÂ\\xa0perceptionÂ\\xa0changed a bit yesterday.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When Hulu first launched, it was supposed to be the media industry&#8217;s answer to YouTube: a place where shows and movies from TV would find an audience online and make advertising money directly for the media companies backing it instead of sharing any of that video ad money with YouTube.  All that professional quality video from NBC, Fox, and Comedy Central brought in a huge audience, helping Hulu grow into the second largest video site online with more than 1 billion video views a month.Well, that formula is great for Hulu, but it isn&#8217;t working for one of its biggest media partners.  Yesterday, Viacom decided to pull two of the top shows from Hulu: Comedy Central&#8217;s The Colbert Report and The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.  Both were regularly among the most popular shows on Hulu, which is a joint venture between NBC Universal and News Corp.  When Hulu first convinced Viacom to allow it to distribute Colbert and The Daily Show back in June, 2008, it was seen as a major milestone for the young video service.Just like on TV, the majority of video viewership on the Web is driven by hits.  The Comedy Central shows were big hits for Hulu, as evidenced by Hulu&#8217;s blog post practically begging Viacom not to leave.  But Viacom decided that Hulu needed Colbert and Jon Stewart more than they needed Hulu.  Clips from the shows will still be availble for free online on TheDailyShow.com and ColbertNation, where Viacom controls and sells all the video ad inventory through its own sales force.The Comedy Central shows are not going behind some sort of Murdochian paywall.  They are still embeddable and shareable across the Web, but with Comedy Central&#8217;s garish video player and its ads.  When you have hit shows, people will find them even if they are not on Hulu or YouTube.  Viacom made the calculation that it can make more money by recentralizing distribution of its hit shows on its own sites than allowing them to be streamed on Hulu.  Why should they split video ad revenues with Hulu when they can have it all themselves.  As Andrew Barron in an insightful postIn other words, whatever they get for ad sales over there at Hulu is going to be split up between Hulu and Comedy Central. Why should Comedy Central cut in Hulu on their ad money? They can sell their own ads for a premium and make 100% of the share if they do it themselves. Some shows may be glad to give Hulu 50% or even more of the rev share because Hulu brings an audience they dont already have. But eventually, for any top show, the leverage tide will turn and the middle person will be the first to go.Hulu is good for shows that can&#8217;t attract a big enough audience to their own sites, but there is too much money left on the table by splitting ad revenues for the hits.  If this trend continues, with media partners pulling their best content from Hulu once it becomes self-sustaining, that could turn into a long-term problem for Hulu.  It&#8217;s also bad for consumers, who don&#8217;t want to have all of their videos in one or two places rather than have to jump from ColbertNation to TheDailyShow.com to HBO.com to CBS.com and so on.  The economic incentive is too great for media properties to centralize their videos on their own sites.  But to consumers, this recentralization looks more like fragmentation and opens up the opportunity for someone else (Steve Jobs, Brian Roberts?) to once again bring it all together in one place. It is clear that consumers don&#8217;t want to hunt across the Web for all their shows, but the economics of video advertising are dictating otherwise.CrunchBase Information',\n",

To enable micro-payments via PlaySpan, developers can add a few lines of provisioning code, set the price and trial period, and then publish the application with the payments technology. Developers will also receive reports, analytics, and automatic settlements on a monthly basis.The Adobe Air Marketplace allows consumers to try paid applications on for free.  If they like the application they can purchase it using a credit card, PayPal, an Ultimate Game Card or over 85 other global payment methods provided by PlaySpan. The micropayments startup has been securing key partnerships, and a deal with Adobe only validates its place as a player in the micropayments space. In December, PlaySpan revealed some telling numbers about the strength of the virtual goods space, reporting that over $30 million was spent on virtual gifts over the holiday season.

All of the offerings are compelling but now more than ever, the startups and companies that develop these platforms are facing pressure to make their offerings the most appealing and feature-rich. Today, Socialtext, the developer of an enterprise social software platform built around microblogging, is rolling out a more powerful version, called Socialtext 4.0, of its collaboration applications.One of the features users were asking for was the ability to create groups within their Socialtext applications. So now, you can create collaborative groups within your Socialtext app, that comes with a group home page including an activity stream of group member updates, a dedicated microblogging channel, and one or more workspaces. Collaborative Groups can be synced with other groups and can also be configured for privacy needs. A group can be listed, with its membership designated as either &#8220;request-to-join&#8221; or open. Alternatively, a group can be unlisted, which makes it completely private.Users can now view the activity streams of any group that they belong too and can also filter the stream, by individual, the people you follow or see the stream of all the employees in the company. Users can also choose to publish their &#8220;Signals,&#8221; which are the Twitter-like short message sent on Socialtext, to one group or all the groups they belong to.And, Socialtext has enhances search in the this new version, providing users the ability to browse and search messages sent by employees in a company. You can also filter your search by group or topic and see threaded conversations. As with many mircoblogging networks, you can now hover over a person&#8217;s avatar to see their presence, which lets teammates know who is reachable at a given moment.Socialtext 4.0 is available on all of Socialtext&#8217;s deployment options, including its on-site managed appliance, desktop application,, mobile apps and web-based product. Socialtext&#8217;s collaboration tool has a freemium model and a paid service. Socialtext&#8217;s offering is compelling for many businesses because of its on-premise offerings that provides security options unavailable in its cloud-based competitors. But as many companies are increasingly comfortable with placing their business operations and communication in the cloud, its wise for Socialtext to build out its platform to offer more functionality.

       "  'comments_content': 'Fresh off a $12 million investment, SMS GupShup, a Twitter-like service in India that is primarily accessed via SMS, is launching an App Store. The store aims to expand SMS GupShup&#8217;s ecosystem by allowing  developers to create SMS-based mobile applications based off of the microblogging service. Launched in April 2007, SMS GupShup (spawned from Webaroo) serves 26 million  users across India. The startup has seen rapid growth in users primarily due to the immense popularity of mobile devices in India. According to the startup, there are 550 million mobile phone users in the country and only 50 million web users. With a 10 to 1 mobile-to-PC ratio and SMS serving as the most popular communications platform, the market is ripe for SMS GupShup to take off. SMS GupShup currently processes over 480 million messages a month and accounts for 5 percent of all texts sent within India. Called AppShup, the app store allows developers to use the platform&#8217;s API to create and connect their apps to the GupShup stream, allowing developers make small SMS applications and widgets.  App Shup pre-enables carrier approval processes, hoping to make the process of submitting apps easier for developers. Currently, AppShup is integrated with the Indian carriers â\\x80\\x93 allowing SMS services for Indian mobile subscribers. The startup says they are conducting discussions with carriers in other countries to expand the program. Close to 100 SMS apps are already available including Tic Tac Toe, Cricket Quiz, and Word Jumble. For now, most of the apps appear to be free.Releasing an API and launching an App Store makes sense for SMS GupShup. The mobile social network has been growing fast and developing an ecosystem around its platform is the next step for development. The startup has even attracted the attention of leaders in the space, like Facebook. Last year, Facebook partnered with SMS GupShup to power and deliver its users&#8217; status updates via text messages. Additionally, SMS GupShup has an advertising strategy. Over 100 advertisers currently run on the network including local insurance provider ICICI Lombard and international brands like Puma, Microsoft and Cadbury.India is a huge market for social networks, with Facebook,  Orkut and even Twitter vying for a share of the growing number of web users who are increasingly flocking to social networks in their day-to-day routines. But clearly, SMS GupShup has tapped into the mobile side of social networks and is seeing success from this in India. It should be interesting to see if the service can develop the vibrant ecosystem Twitter has produced with its third party apps and API. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Together, the companies aim to provide marketers with solutions to optimize the enormously popular social network as an effective online marketing channel. Initially, Omniture and Facebook will focus on the ability to automate Facebook media buying and access analytics that measure customer engagement on the social networking service, although the two companies indicated that the partnership will expand even more in the future. The closer tie builds on the Facebook (and FB apps) analytics capabilities Omniture announced in May 2009. With the new solution, Omniture customers can now utilize the company&#8217;s new SearchCenter Plus product, essentially an enhancement of its search engine marketing management application with new functionality for purchasing Facebook Ads. Omniture customers will thus be able to compare Facebook ad campaign metrics alongside other media channels and increase their ad spend on the social network using tools they&#8217;re already familiar with.In addition, Omniture customers can now generate reports specifically designed to understand ad effectiveness for things like Facebook Pages and applications.Just yesterday, Eric Eldon from InsideFacebook posted a great, detailed article estimating Facebook&#8217;s current and future revenue run rate, projecting that the company could be on track to surpass $1.1 billion in 2010 (and could already have topped $700 million last year).Partnerships like the one with Omniture are a great way for Facebook to appease marketers who have to date been hesitant to make a substantial investment in marketing on the social network as long as they have to learn new ways of setting up campaigns and canâ\\x80\\x99t effectively track the success of those initiatives.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Security scans the barcode right off of your handset&#8217;s display, and you&#8217;re on your way with one less thing to lose.Trinity Mobile, one of the leading companies behind the mobile ticketing push, is today announcing a 1200% year-over-year increase with their mobile boarding pass offerings.In 2008, Trinity Mobile saw 50,000 users opt-in to receive mobile boarding passes rather than the more traditional options. In 2009, this number shot up to 600,000. That&#8217;s still a drop in the bucket compared to the number of people flying with ol&#8217; fashion boarding passes each and every day &#8211; but considering that that growth is almost entirely driven by users picking the option when its offered to them (without any real marketing push by Trinity or the airlines they&#8217;ve partnered with), it&#8217;s pretty impressive.Jupiter Research backs up the fact that the trend is skyrocketing; according to their 2010 Mobile Ticketing report, over 2 billion mobile boarding passes will be sent out in 2010, with that number expected to blast up to 15 billion by 2014.Anecdotally, I can honestly say I&#8217;ve also noticed a massive uptick in mobile boarding pass usage. As someone who travels somewhat frequently, I&#8217;ve seen at least a handful of people going that route on each trip I&#8217;ve taken over the past few months &#8211; especially on flights in Europe. I&#8217;ve yet to be offered a chance to do it myself &#8211; but given that I&#8217;m the type of person who clutches on to their boarding pass like it&#8217;s ice water in Hell, I&#8217;d jump on it on a heartbeat.What about you? Have you used a mobile boarding pass yet? What were your experiences?[Image Credit: Paramount Pictures]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Around 1976, when I was a very young lad, I somehow convinced my parents to spring for a home version of the most cutting edge consumer video game available at the time &#8211; Pong. I fondly remember sitting in the living room and playing that game for tens of hours. My parents actually thought it was fun, too. And so did the neighbors, who all stopped by to try it out. Pong was a genuinely new and totally fun social thing. And it sure beat playing Monopoly. Video games have evolved, but I&#8217;ve never quite had that Pong moment again. Until yesterday, that is, when I visited Microsoft and had a chance to try out Project Natal, an add-on device for Xbox that lets users control games by simply moving their body. Just like real life.I assumed Natal would be a lot like the Wii, which uses motion sensors in handheld devices to control gameplay. But the experience is totally different. Natal allows for extremely nuanced movements, even determining via algorithms what you are doing with body parts the camera can&#8217;t see (like when your hands go behind your back). And for anyone who&#8217;s accidentally and painfully hit a wall or a window playing a strenuous game of Wii Tennis: Natal avoids this problem by keeping you in a zone where your movements are tracked. You just naturally gravitate to the center of the room where your movements get picked up. The game I and others were playing was called Ricochet. You see the back of your blue avatar on the screen (similar to first person shooters). You hit red balls against a group of targets in front of a wall. You can hit the balls, which bounce back towards you after hitting the wall, with your hands or any other body part. Headers, kicks, knees, whatever. You get points for speed and accuracy. You can see a video of Ricochet here.Ricochet is a lot like Pong actually. Not much to it.But it was so damn fun.After I played a game and others took their turn I looked around. Everyone was smiling, and laughing, just like the neighbors back in 1976 while watching us play Pong. And the Microsoft employees were carefully watching us smiling. They looked like they&#8217;d seen that reaction before. Forbes Quentin Hardy, sitting next to me, drew the analogy to Pong (and then wrote about it). I wholeheartedly agree. There&#8217;s something very special about Natal that goes way beyond what Nintendo did with the Wii. I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on one later this year.CrunchBase Information',\n",

But the illegal immigration debate is so politically sensitive that startup founders, who create tons of jobs, get lumped in with migrant farm workers and the discussion sort of comes to a crashing halt there. Now is the time for us to rally, though, and avoid this type of situation. There is real momentum behind the Startup Visa Act, and there&#8217;s a realistic chance that, for once, our government can do something to actually help the innovation ecosystem in Silicon Valley.On Thursday 20 or so Silicon Valley entrepreneurs will travel to Washington D.C. to talk with government officials about the Act, introduced last week by Senator John Kerry (D-MA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN), and drum up more support. Venture capitalist Dave McClure is organizing the trip.The Startup Visa Act of 2010 would create a two year visa for immigrant entrepreneurs who are able to raise a minimum of $250,000, with $100,000 coming from a qualified U.S. angel or venture investor. After two years, if the immigrant entrepreneur is able to create five or more jobs (not including their children or spouse), attract an additional $1 million in investment, or produce $1 million in revenues, he or she will become a legal resident.What can you do to help? Tweet @2gov supporting #StartupVisa exactly at 10 AM Pacific on Wednesday March 3rd (tomorrow). Your messages will be collected and delivered during the group&#8217;s visit to the White House on Thursday. They&#8217;re hoping to get 5,000 tweets. I&#8217;m pretty sure we can do better than that.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As you&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard by now, Apple has filed a lawsuit against device-maker HTC over 20 patents they control. As you might imagine, Google has something to say about it too.&#8220;We are not a party to this lawsuit. However, we stand behind our Android operating system and the partners who have helped us to develop it,&#8221; a Google spokesperson emailed us.A little odd that Google would proactively send us a statement for something they&#8217;re not technically involved in. But, as we&#8217;re all well aware, this suit is much more about Google&#8217;s Android operating system than HTC. And it seems that Google is well aware of that too.As we noted earlier, the clear focus of the suit centers around the HTC devices that are Android-based, including the Nexus One, the Magic/myTouch 3G, the Dream/G1, the Hero, and the Droid Eris. And in fact, with the Nexus One, Google worked closely with HTC to make the device, and is completely in control of selling it.Still, for whatever reason, Google is not named in the suit â\\x80\\x94 at least not yet. You&#8217;ll recall that exactly one month ago, Google decided to turn on multi-touch support for Android users with Nexus Ones. As we noted at the time, Apple was probably not going to be too happy about that. After all, it had been previously reported that the reason Android phones in the U.S. didn&#8217;t support multi-touch up until that point was a gentleman&#8217;s agreement between Apple and Google when the two were still all buddy-buddy. And now we&#8217;re starting to see the fall-out.What&#8217;s odd is that these HTC phones have actually supported multi-touch (only one of the many patents Apple is disputing here), but it&#8217;s only now after Google just enabled it (specifically pinch-to-zoom) in the software that we&#8217;re seeing the lawsuit â\\x80\\x94 of the hardware company involved. Still, this looks to be Apple multi-punching back. And Google doesn&#8217;t sound like it will back down.[image: warner brothers pictures]CrunchBase Information',\n",

Premiere&#8217;s search function queries all sources and will find content whether it&#8217;s on a web video or live TV.

Â\\xa0The criteria for getting one of the phones is to have an application with 3.5 stars or higher and more than 5,000 downloads, which sounds like it could include quite a few developers.In an odd move, Google isn&#8217;t actually allowing the developers to pick which device they&#8217;re receiving â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0if you&#8217;re in the US, you&#8217;ll get a Droid or Nexus One, at random.

Â\\xa0If you&#8217;re not in any of those, you don&#8217;t get a phone at all (Google explains that the phones aren&#8217;t certified in other countries).So why is Google doing this?  Android is already having to deal with fragmentation issues, as a large number of users (and developers) have older phones that aren&#8217;t running Android 2.0.  Now that the Droid, which runs 2.0, comprises a big part of Android&#8217;s market share, it&#8217;s in Google&#8217;s best interest to make sure that Android&#8217;s best developers are building software that&#8217;s compatible with the latest devices.  The free phones also serve as a nice carrot to entice developers to build quality applications.Here&#8217;s the Email Google is sending out:Due to your contribution to the success of Android Market, we wouldlike to present you with a brand new Android device as part of ourdeveloper device seeding program. You are receiving this messagebecause you&#8217;re one of the top developers in Android Market with one ormore of your applications having a 3.5 star or higher rating and morethan 5,000 unique downloads.In order to receive this device, you must click through to this site,read the terms and conditions of the offer and fill out theregistration form to give us your current mailing address so that wecan ship your device.You will receive either a Verizon Droid by Motorola or a Nexus One.Developers with mailing addresses in the US will receive either aDroid or Nexus one, based on random distribution. Developers fromCanada, EU, and the EEA states (Norway, Lichtenstein), Switzerland,Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore will receive a Nexus One. Developerswith mailing addresses in countries not listed above will not receivea phone since these phones are not certified to be used in othercountries.We hope that you will enjoy your new device and continue to build moreinsanely popular apps for Android!Update:: And here&#8217;s a followup statement from Google about the program (it&#8217;s real, for those of you who are worried that it&#8217;s a scam):A thriving developer community is an important part of creating a better mobile experience for users around the world. We hope that offering devices to developers will make it easier for them to create and test great applications.

I am happy to report that it no longer looks exactly like Yelp&#8217;s iPhone app.  The improvements should help it close the gap (Yelp is currently the No. 4 free Travel app, while Citysearch is No. 36).  In fact, it now does some things Yelp&#8217;s app cannot do, the most important of which is that Twitter is baked into it in a very smart way.  Just like on Citysearch&#8217;s website, an increasing number of the local listings are associated with what people are saying about those restaurants, bars, and stores on Twitter.  In addition to Citysearch user reviews, you can also see recent Tweets about the listings.  And the app acts as a limited Twitter client in that you can Tweet out a short review from each profile page.  The app prompts you to sign into your Twitter account and autofills a tweet with a link to the Citysearch page of that business.  It is still a work in progress though.  Right now the Tweets are filled in with an @citysearch handle and thus don&#8217;t show up on the Citysearch&#8217;s page for that business.  By the next update that will change to the @handle of the business, and it the Tweets will start showing up on the Website as well.  Citysearch is building out a directory of business Twitter accounts and is beginning to catch Tweets about its millions of  local listings.  Within the next few weeks, the Twitter account names will start to become part of teh profile data available to developers via its CityGrid APIsSome other nice touches to the app include a sliding icon menu bar at the top, which let you filter different types of listings (restaurants, salons, shopping, clubs, bars, cafes, arts &amp; entertainment, banks, gas stations, movie theaters, pharmacies, bakeries, attractions, parking, and hotels).  And if you shake the iPhone while looking at a listing, an offer might pop up.

You may notice after taking a look at all of the top stories that are being aggregated on the site, that most of the news is positive. That doesn&#8217;t seem to match the general tone of the media writing about Toyota, which has been quick to criticize the car company for its manufacturing mistakes. If you take a look at Twitter sentiment app Tweetfeel, the sentiment of Tweets mentioning Toyota lean more negative. Tweetmeme channels can be set up to pick up only certain news sources.  It looks like Toyota picked the friendlier ones. That being said, itâ\\x80\\x99s definitely interesting to see such a high-profile company taking to Twitter to try to reform its image by engaging directly in a dialogue with consumers. As we&#8217;ve seen with the recent Southwest/Kevin Smith incident, Twitter is influencing public relations in unprecedented ways. Now more than ever, brands are flocking to Twitter to not only monitor and track what&#8217;s being said about their company on Twitter but to influence and participate in the conversation.

       "  'comments_content': \"Film critic Roger Ebert has been unable to speak with his own voice since 2006, when he underwent surgery related to his battle with thyroid cancer. Since then, he&#8217;s been using a computerized voice (notably, &#8220;Alex,&#8221; a voice built-in to Mac OS X), to communicate all this time. But today on Oprah, he&#8217;s debuting a new computerized voice: his own.If you watch the video at the bottom of this post, it&#8217;s pretty remarkable just how much it sounds like Ebert. He has a distinctive voice that a lot of his fans know well thanks to his many years on television reviewing films. You should also watch the longer version of the video here, to compare his new voice to his old one (again, Alex from OS X).So how was a company able to do this for Ebert? That&#8217;s maybe the most interesting part. As heÂ\\xa0explained on his blog a few days ago (Ebert is both a prolific blogger and Twitter user), Ebert stumbled upon a Scottish company called CereProc while surfing the web one day. Their specialty is text-to-speech technology, and Ebert found them because they&#8217;ve been recreating the voices of famous people. So Ebert decided to email them. They told him they needed good quality audio â\\x80\\x94 which didn&#8217;t seem like a problem because of Ebert&#8217;s aforementioned television program.But actually there was a problem. On the show, Ebert was always getting cut-off mid-point, or arguing with people, or there was constantly movie music in the background. Because of these factors, the voice CereProc would have created was less of a regular, casual Ebert, and more of a choppy or enraged one. Ebert humorously notes, &#8220;It would seem strange if I said, &#8216;Let&#8217;s have a moment of silence,&#8217; and in the background, you could hear Transformers ripping off the top of the Great Pyramid.&#8221;But there was another way. Ebert remembered that he also had recorded a number of DVD audio commentary tracks for many classic films, including Citizen Kane. So he asked the studios he had worked with on those if they had the pure audio tracks â\\x80\\x94 and they did. Warner Bros., Criterion Collection, New Line Cinemas, and 20th Century Fox were all able to dig up recordings of Ebert&#8217;s voice.This audio was then sent to CereProc, where the company transcribed all of it so they could find every word they needed. As Ebert notes, they didn&#8217;t need a clip of every word he&#8217;s ever said, just enough so they could reconstruct how he might say a word. He&#8217;ll use a combination of the new voice, which he calls &#8220;Roger Jr.,&#8221; with his old, trusty OS X Alex voice on Oprah today. Says Ebert:Yes, &#8220;Roger Jr.&#8221; needs to be smoother in tone and steadier in pacing, but the little rascal is good. To hear him coming from my own computer made me ridiculously happy.He continues:What will I use this voice for? I could talk with Chaz [Ebert's wife] and our grandchildren â\\x80\\x94 and it would be me, not Alex. I could do audio for Webcasts, talking under clips from movies I&#8217;m describing. I could do radio. I could tell jokes.It&#8217;s a pretty amazing story about technology.    CrunchBase Information\",\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Late last month, Apple made the abrupt decision to remove any applications it deemed to be &#8217;sexy&#8217; from the App Store, citing complaints from parents.  But the process of removing applications was clearly imperfect, asÂ\\xa0Apple pulled down some applications only to restore them a few days later.  And apparently they missed a few: we&#8217;ve gotten word from one app publisher that had a &#8216;boob&#8217; application called Tubes! earn nearly $10,000 in the week following Apple&#8217;s sex ban.  Not because it was an especially good application, but because it was one of the few left.Before Monday, February 15, when the Apple sex ban started going into effect, Tubes was only pulling in around $30 a day.  A day later, that number had more than doubled. As the days passed (and more sexy apps were removed), the application climbed up to a peak of nearly $1,600 a day. And then at 5:30 PM yesterday, Tubes! had its rise to glory cut short.So how exactly did Tubes! slip through the cracks?  The answer is pretty simple: it wasn&#8217;t available in the United States.  The application was published by iPhone development house Mobile Simplicity, which generally builds more useful apps like CraigsMobileList (a mobile client for the popular classifieds site) and What&#8217;s Fresh (which tells you which fruits are in season).  Mobile Simplicity built the Tubes! application at the request of a client, but under the condition that the application would not be sold in the United States, because the firm didn&#8217;t want the application to be listed alongside its more Â\\xa0respectable (ahem) apps.Mobile Simplicity CEO Tony Lombardo says that application finally caught Apple&#8217;s attention when it started climbing up the top app charts (he thinks it got as high as #4 overall in Germany). Lombardo actually says he&#8217;s okay with the ban, but he does wish there was a way for Apple to allow these apps on the App Store under their own category rather than banning them outright.It&#8217;s worth pointing out that in an entirely hypocritical move, Apple has allowed some larger companies like Sports Illustrated and Playboy to keep their sexy apps, which gives them a monopoly on bikinis and cleavage on the App Store.  And, as we can see from the chart above, that can translate to quite a bit of money.CrunchBase Information',\n",

No mention of Android or Google was in the press release.  But the actual legal complaints, which we&#8217;ve obtained and embedded below, make no bones about it.  As expected, this lawsuit is about Android.  HTC, of course, is one of the largest manufacturers of Android handsets.The complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware targets: &#8220;certain mobile communication devices including cellular phones and smart phones, including at least phones incorporating the Android Operating System (collectively, â\\x80\\x9cthe Accused Productsâ\\x80\\x9d).&#8221;  And the complaint filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission specifically calls out the various HTC Android phones (including the Nexus One, Magic/myTouch 3G, Dream/G1, Hero, and Droid Eris) as the main offending products.  By going after the biggest Android manufacturer, Apple is putting all Android cell phone makersâ\\x80\\x94and by extension Googleâ\\x80\\x94 on notice.  Is there any doubt now why Google CEO Eric Schmidt had to resign from Apple&#8217;s board last year?  The battle lines are now drawn.At least one of the patents (No. 7,479,949) lists Steve Jobs as an inventor, and describes a method to use a touchscreen as a graphical user interface &#8220;detecting one or more finger contacts with the touch screen display&#8221; (i.e. multi-touch).

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday brought the news that AOL sold Buy.at, the affiliate marketing network it bought in early 2008, to UK network Digital Window. AOL acquired Buy.at for a rumored $125 million two years ago. Today, AOL filed a 10-K report that revealed that AOL only sold Buy.at for $17 million, taking a hit of a whopping $108 million. Another fascinating tidbit in the filing is related to hyperlocal news site Patch. Patch, which currently offers hyperlocal news for 37 small towns and communities in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and California, was acquired by AOL in June of last year.  According the the 10-K, AOL plans to invest up to $50 million in hyperlocal news site Patch during the remainder of 2010. And it&#8217;s been reported that Patch will roll out to &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of communities in the future. According to the filing, Patch was bought by AOL for $7.0 million in cash. AOL&#8217;s CEO Tim Armstrong, had previously invested $4.5 million in Patch back in his Google days via his private investment firm Polar Capital. Armstrong waived his right to receive any money beyond his initial investment back from the investment, accepting the return of his capital in AOL common stock. Armstrong then returned the $4.5 million back to Polar Capital in the form of AOL shares. We know that Armstrong is not only bullish on niche content but is also looking for AOL to become a content powerhouse.  The company has even developed its own CMS, Seed, which is a content machine that aims to redefine journalism. And AOL just bought internet video company StudioNow, which was integrated into Seed, to boost its video content on editorial sites. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'TechHub (@TechHub), the project set up by Elizabeth Varley to create a physical space in London for tech start-ups &#8220;from from across the UK, Europe, the US and beyond&#8221;, appears to be well on its way. It is now accepting a limited number of Founder Memberships, booking sponsors and details about the actual space will, I&#8217;m told, be outlined shortly. Comparisons could be made with the similar-ish Plug and Play Tech Centers in Silicon Valley, although TechHub&#8217;s model feels like it may well be better adapted to the spread-out nature of the European scene, and potentially more flexible. It&#8217;s also not an incubator.Not bad for an idea dreamt up a couple of years ago by my colleague and editor Mike Butcher, who is now helping Varley out as a board advisor on strategy. Perhaps because of that, the back-story here is relevant.The problem they are tackling is quite clear. While in Silicon Valley you can&#8217;t throw a stone without hitting a geek or a VC, thus giving rise to the amazing technology cluster there, the opportunities to rapidly develop startups in Europe are witheringly limited (in fact, it&#8217;s amazing we do as well as we do). Unless they have an unlimited travel budget, startup founders and developers must find their cofounders and venture backers in their backyard &#8211; that can be very limiting. In addition, while London&#8217;s business friendly regime makes it a key European meeting hub for startups, actually living and working here can be pretty expensive. So what&#8217;s needed is an affordable, easy to access &#8220;mini-cluster&#8221; of other tech companies, which lets you touch down in London, work and network &#8211; and, crucially, not charge you when you&#8217;re not there, as as a managed office or a high-priced private club does. With a sort of &#8216;pay as you go&#8217; model for its community, it turns out that&#8217;s exactly what TechHub wants to do.As Varley tells me: &#8220;London has all the pan-European VCs, it has new seed funds like Seedcamp and PROFounders, an active Angel investor market, many tech events and locally created startups as well as ones from Continental Europe. It&#8217;s also a bridge between Europe and the States. But to access this eco-system you shouldn&#8217;t have to be locked in to a pricey office lease, hit an expensive conference or join a London club where they are more interested in racking up your bar bill than who you are and what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;It&#8217;s a fair assessment. After all, what do most of us want, other than somewhere to sit, power, wifi, coffee, maybe a printer and, ideally, a spot next to someone interesting in the tech industry, rather than just the barista for company in a Starbucks.But what exactly will it be like to work in when it launches in April? Varley says there will be a co-working space with flexible seating so members can work alone or move chairs/desk around to &#8220;huddle&#8221; on a project. There&#8217;ll also be meeting rooms and on some evenings the venue will turn into an event space usable by any one of London&#8217;s many tech events, or ones coming from outside. There&#8217;ll also be about 30 or so desk spaces rentable on a flexible monthly basis.Plus &#8211; get this &#8211;  a device room where mobile startups can test their applications on Android, iPhone, iPad, Nokia Maemo etc etc.In fact, she hopes that the initial London TechHub in the Old Street area of London, where there is already an existing cluster of tech start-ups, will just be the first of many geared towards technology people in other markets. The site itself also has potential. It doesn&#8217;t look like much right now but I&#8217;m told it&#8217;ll have an internal member network at launch. The online side sounds particularly interesting as Varley says they hope to create a platform where startups can run applications that help the community.How&#8217;s it all getting funded? Aside from memberships and desk spaces, TechHub is in the process of closing a &#8220;very limited number of founding sponsor partners&#8221;. The idea is that these are sponsors which will have something to offer TechHub members. She points out that TechHub is not a venture-based incubator and will be agnostic when it comes to the venture scene. It also has a business model: as a commercial entity it&#8217;s set up to be self-sustaining &#8211; crucial in London&#8217;s expensive property scene. This compares with some older style co-working facilities which have often withered on the vine when public sector, charitable or individual backers withdraw.And what&#8217;s Mike Butcher&#8217;s role? Does TechCrunch have an involvement? &#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; he says. He says he&#8217;s involved in a purely personal capacity to advise on what works best for tech people and startups. After promoting the idea and helping it get going he plans to take a back seat.&#8220;Hopefully, TechHub is going to be like a sort of &#8216;tourist office&#8217; for startups, pointing visitors to where the tech scene is, where the companies are around London, across Europe and just networking people. It&#8217;s also going to be neutral. I&#8217;d love it if other bloggers and journalists join up. Elizabeth will run it day to day. I just want to be a common-or-garden member. Frankly, it beats the hell out of working in a Starbucks for me as well.&#8221;It sounds like a few startups might well agree. Check out the many videos on their site in support of the idea, as they&#8217;re running a competition to win a free place if people submit a video about &#8220;Why I want TechHub.&#8221;Update: We should have mentioned other co-working facilities in London, though to be fair none appear to be as laser-focused on tech as TechHub. The Cube in Shoreditch is again non-sector specific, described as a &#8220;conceptual workspace&#8221; whose members consist of freelance graphic designers, copywriters, web designers and film production companies. The Hub is aimed at &#8220;social entreprenuers&#8221;. eOffice is not a co-working space but a managed office facility providing a hot-desking. Again it is not on the niche of tech. As a commenter points out below, The Trampery is a co-working space where anyone can drop in, aimed non-specifically at &#8220;software developers, designers, consultants, entrepreneurs and other creative spirits&#8221; as well as &#8220;creative freelancers and small businesses&#8221;. It&#8217;s the former office of Trampoline Systems.Naturally, other co-working or community spaces don&#8217;t focus on technology, mainly because they can&#8217;t afford to close themselves off to potential business from outside that sector. In fact, a close analysis of all the London co-working spaces listed at the Coworking Wiki reveals that not a single space is focused completely and totally on the technology sector. General they are aimed at the &#8216;creative&#8217; sector which is dominated by design/media companies. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Yesterday I visited Microsoft HQ on a surprisingly warm winter day in Redmond, Washington. This was an all day briefing with Craig Mundie, Microsoft&#8217;s Chief Research and Strategy Officer, and his team on various Microsoft projects. We spent part of the morning getting a preview of some of the projects on display at the upcoming TechFest &#8211; an employee event where Microsoft researchers share some of the things they&#8217;re working on. Some of these projects eventually become products or features in one form or another. Others don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s sort of like a high school science fair, if you can imagine the students a decade or two older than that and with nearly unlimited funds to play with.I took brief videos of all of the projects on display. The ones with obvious product potential in the near future are Project Gustav and the translating telephone, which are the first two below. But all are fascinating.Immersive Digital Painting (Naga Govindaraju)A realistic painting-system prototype that enables artists to become immersed in the digital painting experience. Project Gustav achieves a high level of interactivity and realism by leveraging the computing power of modern GPUs, taking full advantage of multitouch and tablet input technology and our novel, natural media-modeling and brush-simulation algorithms. The prototype provides realistic models for pastel and oil media, with more to come.    The Translating! Telephone (Kit Thambiratnam, Frank Seide)Demonstration of a system for live speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation of telephone calls. The goal in the telephone-call scenario is to provide an aid for cross-language communication in the event that no other means of communication exists. The system makes extensive use of speaker-adaptation technologies to achieve reasonable, real-time speech-to-text transcription accuracy. This is then translated live using machine translation to provide speech-to-text translation and further fed into a text-to-speech system to realize speech-to-speech translation. The speech-to-text transcript and the translated transcript are shown to the users to enable validation of their intentions.    Mobile Surface (Chunhui Zhang):An interaction system for mobile computing. The goal is to bring the Microsoft Surface experience to mobile scenarios and to enable 3-D interaction with mobile devices. Demonstration of how to transform any surface, such as a coffee table or a piece of paper, into a Mobile Surface by using a mobile device and a camera-projector system. Also shows 3-D object imaging, augmented reality, and multiple-layer 3-D information visualization. Developed a system with the camera-projector component to scan 3-D objects in real time while doing normal projection. To visualize, 3-D data can be projected onto a surface formed by a piece of paper while maintaining the original scale as if it were printed on that paper, and a user can interact with the projected content with a hand. Mobile Surface enables you to interact with digital contents and information around you from anywhere.    Natural User Interfaces with Physiological Sensing (Desney Tan and Dan Morris):Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s work on interaction modalities, or natural user interfaces. While these modalities rely on sensors and devices situated in the environment, there is a need for new modalities that enhance the mobile experience. We take advantage of sensing technologies that enable us to decode the signals generated by the body. We will demo muscle-computer interfaces, electromyography-based armbands that sense muscular activation directly to infer finger gestures on surfaces and in free space, and bio-acoustic interfaces, mechanical sensors on the body that enable us to turn the entire body into a tap-based input device.    Inside the Cloud: New Cloud-Computing Interaction (Chunhui Zhang):With cloud computing, users can access their personal data anywhere and anytime. Cloud computing also will enable new forms of data to be provided for users, with applications ranging from Web data mining to social networks. But cloud computing necessitates new interaction metaphors and input-output technology. The cloud mouse is one such technology. With six degrees of freedom and with tactile feedback, the cloud mouse will enable users to orchestrate, interact with, and engage with their data as if they were inside the cloud.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Apple is using its strong patent portfolio to fight iPhone competitors in court.  Its latest target is HTC.  Apple has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the cell phone manufacturer.  The suit involves &#8220;20 Apple patents related to the iPhone&#8217;s user interface, underlying architecture and hardware.&#8221; Steve Jobs is quoted in a press release saying: &#8220;We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We&#8217;ve decided to do something about it.  We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.&#8221;  The lawsuit itself is not available yet online.  We&#8217;ve asked Apple for a copy.The lawsuit could be a way to go after Android, although Android is not mentioned in the press release. HTC manufactures some of the most successful Android handsets, from the first G1 up to the latest Nexus One.  HTC&#8217;s touchscreen Android phones are the most similar to the iPhone.  If that is the case, the lawsuit is a shot across Android&#8217;s bow and a warning to all Android manufacturers.  This is not the first time Apple has gone after a mobile phone competitor.  It is involved in similar patent litigation with Nokia.  That lawsuit is more about Apple trying to get Nokia to license its patents.  And the HTC suit may have the same motivation.  But the fact that the lawsuit was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) as well as in a U.S. District Court in Delaware suggests that Apple is really going for the jugular.  &#8220;The ITC does not award damages,&#8221; says Peter Toren, a patent lawyer with New York City law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman.  The only remedy the ITC can award is an order to stop the importation of the infringing product.  HTC is based in Taiwan.Apple thinks it owns the concept of the touchscreen Web phone and it wants other cell phone makers to pay for copying the iPhone or to stop altogether.  Who will Apple sue next?  Motorola?  Palm?  Research in Motion?Update: The complaint is embedded below and described further here. .\\t\\t\\t\\tApple vs HTCCrunchBase Information',\n",

His resignation hasn&#8217;t been announced yet (nor has his LinkedIn profile been updated), but we&#8217;ve confirmed hallway rumors that he jumped ship at the end of January 2010 both with the man in question and the company he used to work for.Faith has moved to Austin, Texas &#8211; just in time for SXSW &#8211; where he has joined local startup WhaleShark Media as SVP of Engineering. That company&#8217;s still in stealth mode, but was founded by former Bankrate COO Cotter Cunningham, so we&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on that one.It&#8217;s worth noting that another key member of the MySpace Mobile team, Ulf Waschbusch, also left the company in July 2009 &#8211; he recently landed at gaming startup Garena.I asked MySpace who was running all things mobile now that both employees walked away from the company, and they informed me that stepping in for Faith is Nat Brown. In case you&#8217;re not familiar with that name, Brown was once one of Microsoft&#8217;s foremost technical minds &#8211; he created and evangelized the ActiveX/COM object model in the early nineties and went on to play a crucial role in the creation of XML, DHTML, and the first Xbox. Brown went on to do a brief stint as CTO at CAC Media before serving the same role at online music startup iLike, which was acquired by MySpace in August 2009.MySpace says Brown will henceforth be taking charge of the Mobile division, and that we can expect a lot from that particular unit in the &#8220;very, very near future&#8221;.We&#8217;ll see.CrunchBase Information',\n",

HootSuite&#8217;s features are targeted towards helping marketing professionals keep track of the Twitter conversations happening on the web. The startup offers a free and paid version of its web app, and mobile clients. The Android app features much of the same functionality as the iPhone app, including the ability to manage multiple Twitter account, create streams for hashtags and searches, schedule messages for the future, add followers to lists and accounts, share photos and shorten URLs. The paid versions allow for unlimited Twitter accounts plus on-board, click-through statistics tracking. The updated paid version of the iPhone App will include Facebook integration and landscape view. And in an effort to boost revenue, HootSuite is partnering with 140 Proof to serve ads on all versions of its mobile offerings. Ads are served within users&#8217; Twitter streams on and are clearly marked as ads, but act as Tweets that can be retweeted. HootSuite is taking the advertising risk on 140 Proof because the startup promises highly targeted advertising. Twitter clients pass 140 Proof a user ID list (with no names) and the public information contained in a Twitter users profile, and on the advertiser side, advertisers bid on ads to be directed toward users based on keywords in tweets, followers, as well as device, location and platform. 140 Proofâ\\x80\\x99s algorithms calculates Twittererâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cpersonaâ\\x80\\x9d based on public tweets and who they follow and serves ads to users based on this data. The deal with HootSuite is a big coup for 140 Proof, which just launched its network a few weeks ago. OneRiot is doing something similar with its realtime ad network RiotWise, and is seeing promising results during its private beta. And we are anxiously awaiting Twitter&#8217;s new advertising model which may or may not be revealed in the near future. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There has never been a shortage or rumors that Netflix streaming is coming to the iPhone. It just makes sense that eventually, the hot device and the hot service will meet. And that may be happening sooner rather than later if a survey being sent out by Netflix is any indication.As the site Hacking Netflix reports tonight, Netflix is asking certain users about their interest in streaming movies and television shows to the iPhone. Notably, this would apparently only work over WiFi, which is hardly surprising given AT&amp;T&#8217;s reluctance to let stream-heavy fare on its network.Here&#8217;s the full text of what&#8217;s being asked in the survey:&#8220;Imagine that Netflix offers its subscribers the ability to instantly watch movies &amp; TV episodes on their iPhone. The selection availability to instantly watch includes some new releases, lots of classics and TV episodes. There are no advertisements or trailers, and movies start in as little as 30 seconds. You can fast-forward, rewind, and pause or watch again. The movies &amp; TV episodes you instantly watch are included in your Netflix membership for no additional fee.Whenever you want to instantly watch content on your iPhone, your iPhone must be connected to a Wi-Fi network (such as one you might have at home or at work, or in public places like coffee shops, book stores, hotels, airports, etc.)If this functionality were available, how likely would you or someone in your household be to instantly watch movies &amp; TV episodes on your iPhone via a Wi-Fi network?&#8221;So that&#8217;s obviously very straightforward. Clearly, Netflix is thinking about providing an app that would do this on the iPhone, iPod touch, and the upcoming iPad as well, but recent remarks by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings suggests that none of this is a priority for the company.Hastings has also noted in the past that eventually the service will likely be on the iPhone. But if they&#8217;re already gauging interest among users, hopefully it will be sooner than he&#8217;s let on in the past.Â\\xa0As Hacking Netflix notes, earlier surveys from Netflix gauging interest in the Wii and PS3 consoles with Netflix were early indicators of the service on both of those devices.Of course, you have to wonder if Apple would approve such an app that would compete directly with iTunes.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google will roll out a number of security enhancements to Gmail this week, and perhaps as early as Tuesday, says a source with knowledge of the new features. The changes are specifically designed to cut down on phishing and hacking attacks on Gmail accounts.There are two specific changes that we&#8217;ve heard Google is implementing. The first is a secondary line of defense when a user has lost his or her password. If a Gmail account is accessed from a new computer, the user will have the option of receiving a text message with a new one time use pass key. They then enter that pass key into Gmail to authenticate themselves and lock out any bad users with access to the account.  Google is also possibly implementing a different version of OAuth for its contacts exporter (something often used by other services to import Gmail contacts). It&#8217;s likely to be OAuth Wrap, an easier to implement version of OAuth. If developers can be convinced to use it instead of harvesting and storing user credentials, there&#8217;s less of a security hole.These changes are likely in response to the Chinese security incident from earlier this year. A secondary line of security for users would have avoided the Twitter documents leak from last year, which originally started with a guessed Gmail password and spiraled out of control from there.This isn&#8217;t confirmed and Google hasn&#8217;t responded yet to our email, but we&#8217;ll update with any further information.CrunchBase Information',\n",

And to light a fire under some would-be entrepreneur fanboys. Here&#8217;s the full statement around the sentence:Most people think the important thing about the iPad is its form factor: that it&#8217;s fundamentally a tablet computer. We think Apple has bigger ambitions. We think the iPad is meant to be a Windows killer. Or more precisely, a Windows transcender. We think Apple foresees a future in which the iPad is the default way people do what they now do with computers (and some other new things).Following the iPad&#8217;s unveiling in January, people seem fairly evenly split about whether the device will be a failure, or the next big thing (I&#8217;m on the record as saying I think it will take some time to catch on, but then will quickly rise in popularity towards the future of computing). This is a smart bet for Y Combinator (and the startups that apply for this RFS) to make. If they&#8217;re right, and this is the future of computing, these startups getting to work around the time of the iPad launch (it&#8217;s still set to ship at the end of this month) should be well positioned to fully take advantage of the device.And Y Combinator is thinking big for these startups too. It would be easy to tell companies to make apps for the iPad that are basically ports of current mobile apps, but the RFS points to this post by Facebook&#8217;s (and FriendFeed co-founder, and Gmail creator) Paul Buchheit, noting the future iPad applications may be unlike anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before.Something else that is interesting to Y Combinator is how you get this new device in the door in businesses. They seem to think you&#8217;ll have to trick your company&#8217;s IT department:One particularly interesting subproblem is how to introduce iPads into big companies. This will probably have to be done by stealth initially, as happened with microcomputers. They&#8217;ll have to be introduced as something individuals use, and which doesn&#8217;t really count as a computer and thus can&#8217;t be vetoed by the IT department. Don&#8217;t worry about this; it&#8217;s just a little tablet computer.Just as iPhone app development has exploded, and Android developers are finally starting to see some real money, iPad developers are already in demand. Windows-killer or not, this is certainly an area to watch for the foreseeable future.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Their publications (which include Villiage Voice, SF Weekly, and 12 others) are highly tailored towards specific cities. So it makes some sense that they&#8217;d get into the mobile social location space that is getting so hot right now. But you might not have thought it would be with a happy hour app.But that&#8217;s exactly what Village Voice Media is launching tomorrow alongside app developer GoTime. Happy Hours, is an free application for the iPhone, Android, and the mobile web. With it, you get access to some 15,000 happy hours in 30 different cities around the country. You simply load the app up, tell it where you are (which it can know automatically on the iPhone and Android phones), and let it show you happy hours close by.While happy hour apps are nothing new (here&#8217;s another one we covered not too long ago), most are small and based around one city, or a handful of cities. Happy Hours is nationwide, so it&#8217;s good for traveling. Also, thanks to the Village Voice association, it has a range of data about establishments such as atmosphere, type of food served, etc â\\x80\\x94 not to mention full reviews, when available.The app launches tomorrow for the following 30 cities: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Broward-Palm Beach, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Orange County, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington DC.Check out more in the video below.

       "  'comments_content': 'You know all those share buttons across the Web?  They are getting more and more social.  What I mean by that is initially they were used to share stories or content mostly via email on a one-to-one basis, but over the past year or so services like Facebook and Twitter have been overtaking the way people use those buttons to share stories, videos, images, and links.  The way most people interact with these button is through widgets on publisher&#8217;s sites.  But one of the largest sharing button networks, ShareThis, is about to turn that around and introduce a Share Stream which shows you what your Facebook friends are sharing across the Web. Soon your Twitter followers will be added as well (at launch you will only be able to see what everyone is sharing across Twitter).  Of course, the Share Stream is also available as a customizable widget to show on any site.A link at the bottom of each ShareThis widget will invite you to find out what your friends are sharing.  When you click on it, you will be taken to a Share Stream where you can log in using your Facebook, Twitter, Google, or Yahoo IDs.  There you will see what your else people are sharing from the site you just came from or about the same topic as the page you were on.  The Share Stream can be filtered by trending or real-time topics, by source, by what everyone is sharing, or only by what your friends are sharing.ShareThis gets its data from the 130,000 sites which use its sharing buttons and collectively reach 430 million unique visitors a month.  Its No.1 competitor AddThis is somewhat bigger, but ShareThis recognizes the same users across sites and creates a semantic index of the every page where its buttons are placed.  Using a taxonomy based on Wikipedia categories, ShareThis can figure out the topics associated with each page that is shared.  Thanks to this topic knowledge, ShareThis can suggest other pages on related topics which are also being shared by your friends or more generally.CEO Tim Schigel plans to create an ad network of sorts which will let publishers and advertisers target ads to people based on what they are sharing based on browser cookie data (yup, every time you share, you are being tracked, anonymously).  He keeps data on engagement levels after people share content, and while the pageviews resulting from each click are still highest for email, Facebook is catching up.  And Facebook has a bigger multiplier effect (on average three different people click on each shared link versus just one for email) which puts it over the top in terms of impact.  Twitter&#8217;s multiplier effect is six times higher (18 clicks per link), but its engagement levels are much lower.More importantly, people who follow a link from Facebook, says Schigel, &#8220;are 50 percent more engaged,&#8221; on average, than people who find the same page from search.  Intuitively that makes sense because there is more hit or miss with search results compared to following a suggested link from someone you trust.Like other sharing networks, ShareThis has seen Facebook soar to 42 percent of all sharing, beating out email (at 40.7 percent) for the first time in February.  Twitter represents 8.7 percent of all sharing via the ShareThis button. So the Share Stream pretty much already exists on Facebook and Twitter alone.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In the months following the iPhone App Store&#8217;s launch in July 2008, it became clear that the platform was turning into a gold rush. Â\\xa0Success stories of one-man companies earning $250,000 in a few months became common. And even though the odds of striking it rich were clearly much lower than the media portrayed, a huge surge of developers started building iPhone applications.  Android Market, where meager sales have been the norm, was left in the dust.Now Android Market is getting its own glimmers of hope. Edward Kim, who built the application &#8220;Car Locator&#8221; around five months ago, has just announced that he&#8217;s pulling in $13,000 a month from the application, which &#8220;started as a little side-project while [he] was vacationing with [his] family&#8221;.Kim writes that the free version of the application has been downloaded around 70,000 times, while the paid application has been downloaded 6,590 times.  The price was initially $1.99, but he moved it up to $3.99 (he notes that despite doubling the price, the number of downloads didn&#8217;t decrease too much).So what was Kim&#8217;s secret to success?  Well, a big part of it seems to have come from the fact that Car Locator is now a featured app on Android Market, which means Google more prominently displays it to users than &#8216;normal&#8217; applications.  Getting featured increased the app&#8217;s revenue by over four fold.  This probably comes as bittersweet news to developers (you can&#8217;t exactly count on being featured by Google), but Kim says that he&#8217;s ranked between 100 and 200th place in the Market&#8217;s &#8216;Paid&#8217; category, which means that there are probably at least 100 other applications seeing similar success. Â\\xa0Android Market is still far behind the App Store in many respects (except for openness), but it looks like it&#8217;s finally starting to mature.Kim is very optimistic about the future of the platform, telling me &#8220;Android appears to have grown enough that developers can make some money off of it, but there&#8217;s not SO many developers that you&#8217;ll never get noticed.&#8221;Here are some of Kim&#8217;s other observations:The application was netting an average of about $80-$100/day, until it became a featured app on the Marketplace. Since then, sales have been phenomenal, netting an average of $435/day, with a one day record of $772 on Valentine&#8217;s Day. Too bad I didn&#8217;t have a Valentines date this year &#8212; we would&#8217;ve gone somewhere real special!There appears to be clear peaks on the weekends and during holidays. This was always my hunch, but I think I can finally say this with certainty since the signal-to-noise ratio is much better now.Some may be quick to point out that a featured Android application is only able to net $400/day, while top iPhone apps make thousands. But the Android market appears to rotate applications in and out of the featured apps list in some psedo-random fashion. Every time I open the Marketplace app, the featured list is different and most of the time, I donâ\\x80\\x99t even see my app on there.The price of the application was increased from $1.99 to $3.99. I ran a few price experiments and was surprised to see that though I doubled the price of the app, the number of purchases decreased by much less than half. Android users appear to have a willingness to pay more than a couple dollars for apps.Piracy appears to be an increasing problem. A quick search for Car Locator on Twitter reveals links where people can download the .apk file without paying. I tend to have the same attitude on piracy as Balsamiq, so I&#8217;m not too worried about it, but I would love to hear some typical statistics on Android piracy.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last month, Google announced plans to sell 1 gigabit-per-second fiber optic broadband to consumers. The plan called for it to be rolled out to no fewer than 50,000 homes in the initial test, and maybe as many as 500,000, but didn&#8217;t specify where it would be rolled-out. Topeka, Kansas wants in. Bad.The city&#8217;s mayor today signed a proclamation that for the rest of the month, Topeka will be known as &#8220;Google, Kansas.&#8221; Yes, you&#8217;re reading that correctly â\\x80\\x94 Topeka is now &#8220;Google.&#8221;Now, to be clear, this isn&#8217;t a legal name change. Lawyers advised the mayor and the city council that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to change the name for just the month and then change it back (no word on if they also advised them that it would be well, stupid) â\\x80\\x94 so instead they&#8217;re going with this proclamation asking people to simply call the city &#8220;Google.&#8221;While this is a silly way to get Google&#8217;s attention, the benefit could be huge. The 1Gb/sec fiber is roughly 100 times faster than what most Americans get today for Internet speeds. That&#8217;s especially true in rural areas. And while Topeka may not be the most rural city in the country (it is the state capital and has over 120,000 citizens), they could undoubtedly make good use of this ultra fast connection. Google&#8217;s fiber connection is still more than 20 times faster than even most fast broadband connections.Humorously, this isn&#8217;t the first time Topeka has tried something like this. Apparently, in August 1998, the city has a proclamation to change its name to &#8220;ToPikachu&#8221; â\\x80\\x94 yes, after the Pokemon character. So this move seems roughly 100 times more sane than that one.Also funny â\\x80\\x94 apparently this special city council meeting lead to the postponement of another one, where they were actually going to talk about real issues.

Friends, that&#8217;s exactly what happened to Nick Bonatsakis of Atlantia Software after submitting a new app called QuackPhone last week and getting this reply:&#8220;Dear Atlantia Software LLC,We&#8217;ve reviewed your application DuckPhone and we have determined that this application contains minimal user functionality and will not be appropriate for the App Store.If you would like to share it with friends and family, we recommend you review the Ad Hoc method on the Distribution tab of the iPhone Developer Portal for details on distributing this application among a small group of people of your choosing or if you believe that you can add additional user functionality to DuckPhone we encourage you to do so and resubmit it for review.Sincerely,iPhone App Review Team&#8221;Now last time I checked this was America and if we in America want to spend our money on 99 cent apps that make duck noises, then by gar, that&#8217;s our gar-given right. Not so and our outrage should be boundless. As Nick writes:This is a line I had hoped would not be crossed, but sadly it has been. I&#8217;m not sending this email because the world will be deprived if they can&#8217;t experience this application, but rather, in hopes that some or all of you will publish this story so that the public at large continues to hear about the ridiculous behavior of Apple in matters such as these. As time goes on, this platform is becoming more of a burden on developers, this will in turn lead to talented people moving on to more open platforms. In the end, the customer loses, and I sincerely hope Apple will realize this.Amen, Nick. A line has been crossed. When a man can&#8217;t bring his duck app to to market because of a capricious decision by a fixie-riding Californian App Store Review Team Member in a tight t-shirt and jeans ensemble then a man needs to do something. God speed you, Nick, and your duck app. Don&#8217;t give up on this. You can be the Rosa Parks of duck apps.Seriously, Apple, WTDuck? It&#8217;s a friggin duck phone.

Upon hearing the news, we reached out to both Google and Yahoo (which owns Flickr) to see what it means for the future of the partnership. The responses were interesting.Google, for its part, says that it will allow third-party sites (including Flickr) to continue to integrate with it. Here&#8217;s the statement they sent us:We believe that openness is always the best approach and will allow third-party sites to continue to integrate with Picnik.

Or maybe they just don&#8217;t really know how the acquisition will affect things yet.The problem is that Picnik is currently the only way to do that majority of edits on Flickr. Without it, the product as a whole becomes less valuable. So will Yahoo have to build its own photo-editor (which they obviously were against before, or they would have done it rather than partner with Picnik)? Or will they partner with someone else &#8212; maybe Aviary?Regardless, Google has a history of acquiring companies and then letting their products wither (Dodgeball, Jaiku, etc). Let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s not the case here, and that Picnik is at the very least integrated into Picasa (Google&#8217;s online photo service), because it&#8217;s a solid service.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Mobile ad network Mobclix has made its first acquisition. The startup is buying up Heartbeat, a cloud-based SaaS that helps iPhone app developers manage and access sales data, crash reporting, ongoing hourly usage stats, reviews and rankings. The acquisition price was not disclosed. Mobclix bought Heartbeat from app developer Enormego, which launched the software in January 2009. So far Heartbeat has tracked $25 million in paid application downloads with over 3,500 applications using the platform (55 percent of which are paid apps). Heartbeat&#8217;s offerings will be folded into Mobclix&#8217;s platform to offer Heartbeat&#8217;s software to both Android and iPhone app developers. Heartbeat&#8217;s sales analytics will be integrated with Mobclix ad revenue data to allows developers to have a visualization of all aspects of an applicationâ\\x80\\x99s revenue including ad monetization, in-app purchase and paid models. While Heartbeat&#8217;s current service only caters to the iPhone app market, its technology will be adapted to serve Android apps as well.The acquisition makes sense for Mobclix to boost its exchange&#8217;s offerings. Mobclix allows app developers to sign up with their ad inventory and ad networks bid for the spots based on age, gender, location, and other factors. The ads being served change automatically, based on which ad network is bidding the highest to reach the users of that particular app. It also lets advertisers buy across a variety of apps based on demographic, geo-targeting, and behavioral characteristics. The startup recently announced a deal to offer Nielsenâ\\x80\\x99s ad targeting data into its ad exchange to enhance ad targeting. With the acquisitions of AdMob by Google and Quattro Wireless by Apple , ad exchanges and networks like Mobclix, Greystripe and others are working hard to boost the appeal and strength of their products. But according to Gartner, the mobile advertising market will generate $13 billion in revenues by 2013, leaving plenty of possible revenue to go around. CrunchBase Information',\n",

In the past, only select partners, particularly big search engines such as Google or Bing, got the full firehose.  Search engines need it more than others to be able to index and serve up results in realtime.  Today, smaller search startups are also getting the firehose. These include Ellerdale, Collecta, Kosmix, Scoopler, twazzup, CrowdEye, and Chainn Search (which has not yet launched).  In December at Le Web, Twitter indicated that the firehose would open up to more and more developers.  This is a step in that direction.  And while Twitter makes deep-pocketed partners like Google and Bing pay for the firehose, it treats startups differently with more favorable (even free) terms, or at least it used to. These aren&#8217;t the first startups to get the firehose, and they won&#8217;t be the last.  Once they get to a certain size though, they&#8217;ll pay if they don&#8217;t already.

About a month later, they gave out the details, including that it would be taking place exactly a week before Facebook&#8217;s big conference, f8. Seeing as both are geared towards developers, it&#8217;s pretty clear they&#8217;re gunning for one another. But it seemed that f8 would have one large advantage: ticket price. But now it appears that may not be such an advantage.The ticket page for f8 was briefly online earlier today at this URL. It appears that Facebook has since put it under password protection. But guess who was able to grab a screenshot? This guy. Notably, it appears that regular f8 tickets will be $325 this year. While that&#8217;s still about $140 cheaper (140, get it?) than Chirp, it&#8217;s not drastically cheaper, as many had been thinking. In the past, Facebook has sold tickets for $250, or even $150 if you signed up early. But, f8 still has one major price point advantage: tickets for students are only $50.When asked why tickets were so expensive to Chirp, conference organizers noted that unlike f8, Chirp wasn&#8217;t accepting outside sponsors, which f8 has used in previous years to keep costs down. It&#8217;s not clear if Facebook is doing that again this year, but judging from the ticketing page, at least Eventbrite is a partner.f8 will take place this year on April 21 and 22 at the San Francisco Design Center (same as previous years). Again, this is exactly one week after the two-day Chirp conference. We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook about the event, and ticket prices, and will update when we hear back.Update: Here&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s statement to me:We are preparing a Facebook Connect-enabled registration page with EventBrite in anticipation for f8, and will open it in the coming weeks. Watch the f8 Page for the latest details (www.facebook.com/f8).In the past, tickets have been $150 for early bird; $50 for student; $250 for regular.So basically, it sounds like that was indeed the page, and it just went up a bit early. And yes, prices appear to be going up.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last week, Facebook was affected by a glitch that sent what appear to be thousands of private messages to the wrong people â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0a very alarming security breach given the amount of data 400 million users have entrusted to the service.  News of the bug hit the press, Facebook issued a typically vague statement saying very few people were affected and that an investigation was looking into the matter, and that was that.Most people probably just shrugged their shoulders at the news, but it&#8217;s yet another blemish against the company&#8217;s security record.  This isn&#8217;t the first time Facebook has run into security issues, and I&#8217;ve grown increasingly concerned that the company might be playing fast and loose with its quality assurance policies because it doesn&#8217;t want to sacrifice the rapid iteration it&#8217;s famous for. Â\\xa0With this in mind, I reached out to Facebook late last week to ask about their protocol for deploying code and how the bug made it through in the first place.  The company responded to some of my questions, and refused to answer others.At least, Facebook eventually answered some of my questions. At first, the company sent me a vague statement reiterating that they were investigating the issue, and that they &#8220;maintain industry-leading quality assurance and security systems, and the reliability of Facebook is our top priority.&#8221;In response, I reminded the Facebook spokesperson that it had just sent thousands of messages to people who weren&#8217;t meant to receive them, which would seem to indicate that it is not, in fact, on the bleeding edge of online security.  I restated my questions and the company got back to me with this more detailed overview of its QA and code deployment policies, found below. Note that it begins with a general statement Facebook provided, along with more direct answers to my questions (which are in bold).Facebook hires the most qualified and highly-skilled engineers we can find â\\x80\\x93 most from industry or from top universities. Upon joining the company, every engineer and engineering manager participates in a six-week intensive â\\x80\\x98boot campâ\\x80\\x99 training. Our code review process is rigorous, and we phase out changes and test them before they go live for real users to detect any potential issues. During code pushes, our engineering, user support, and operations teams work cross-functionally to monitor the state of the push and to identify any problems early. We also have the capability to quickly push code updates to all of our datacenters worldwide, and to enable or disable critical features of the site if there is a problem.All of these checks worked together on Wednesday, as designed, to limit the impact of the error and stopped it within minutes. We were able to swiftly disable access to the users who received messages and remove those messages from Facebook, although we were unable to prevent email notifications from being sent to affected users. It is important to recognize that no system is perfect and no company avoids mistakes all of the time. However, we would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize to all affected users and ensure them that we are committed to investigating Wednesdayâ\\x80\\x99s issue and to learning from it.What are your protocols for pushing code?We have staged rollout changes that go through multiple phases before going to end users, so we can proactively detect any problems. As the changes get rolled out to users, a set of support, engineering, and operation leaders are actively engaged to monitor the state of the push. As soon as any issue is identified, we have multiple tools to quickly disable critical features. The combination of these mechanisms dramatically limited the exposure related to Wednesdayâ\\x80\\x99s issue.Are there multiple people reviewing all code that gets pushed?Yes, we have a rigorous code review process and no code goes live on the site unless it has been reviewed and approved by a skilled engineer.What changes are you making to ensure that this does not happen again? We cannot discuss specific improvements, but we take privacy and security very seriously and are continually improving our code standards, processes, and systems to help us build high quality products quickly.When do you expect to conclude your investigation, because I will certainly be following up for the details about it?As a general practice, we do not comment on investigations like this.While interesting, none of this is particularly surprising.  And because Facebook isn&#8217;t commenting on the outcome of the investigation, we&#8217;ll probably never find out what caused the bug (or if company protocol was even followed in this case). Â\\xa0But hey, at least they say they&#8217;re doing the right things.It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Facebook is by no means the only company affected by such issues. Â\\xa0Last year, I wrote a post called the Sorry State of Online Privacy, where I detailed some of the security lapses that had hit Facebook, Twitter, and Google (and of course there&#8217;s the recent Google Buzz fiasco). All of these companies would likely claim to have state of the art testing and security measures, yet such problems seem to pop up every few months. Â\\xa0I&#8217;m aware that it&#8217;s impossible to have a fully secure system, but that doesn&#8217;t mean engineering teams should be treating these problems as inevitabilities. Â\\xa0To reiterate what I wrote last year, the word â\\x80\\x98privateâ\\x80\\x99 should not mean â\\x80\\x9cthis will remain hidden until we accidentally break somethingâ\\x80\\x9d.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google has acquired online photo editing site Picnik, according to a blog post made by the photo editing startup today. Google also announced the acquisition on its blog. The entirety of Picnik&#8217;s blog post is embedded below.Terms of the deal were not disclosed in either posts.Picnik is one of the fastest growing photo sites on the web. Picnik is a powerful, cloud-based photo editor that is integrated directly into Flickr, SmugMug and other photo repositories. Interestingly, Picnik is Flickr&#8217;s default photo editor. I&#8217;m assuming that will discontinue with the acquisition. It would make sense that Google would fold Picnik&#8217;s technology into its photo sharing product and Flickr competitor Picasa, which has some basic editing offerings but doesn&#8217;t compare to Picnik&#8217;s vast editing technologies. Competing online photo editors include Fotoflexer  and Photoshop.com.Picnik offers a base version of its photo editor for free, and subscription model for a more feature-rich offering. When we spoke to the startup&#8217;s CEO Jonathan Sposato a year ago, Picnik was cashflow positive, a little more than two years after launch.Google is on a bit of a shopping spree; the search giant bought iPhone email app reMail, and social search startup Aardvark in a matter of weeks. When Bitnik, Inc was created, our founders envisioned making great software for real people and giving users the power to edit digital photos in their browser, without having to purchase or download complicated software. While our first office in 2005 only had two desks, today weâ\\x80\\x99ve grown to 20 employees and have become the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most fun online photo editor, with millions of visitors every month. As weâ\\x80\\x99ve grown together over the years, weâ\\x80\\x99ve worked hard to build a company of great people creating great software. We think our emphasis on strong partnerships, a fun culture and you, our users, is what has made Picnik so awesome.And all this leads us to todayâ\\x80\\x99s exciting news: weâ\\x80\\x99ve just been acquired by Google! What does this mean for Picnik? It means we can think BIG. Google processes petabytes of data every day, and with their worldwide infrastructure and world-class team, it is truly the best home we could have found. Under the Google roof weâ\\x80\\x99ll reach more people than ever before, impacting more lives and making more photos more awesome.What does this mean for you Picnikers? Nothing is changing right away, but Picnik now has more potential than ever before. The team that built Picnik from the grass up will continue making advanced and powerful photo-editing easier, more intuitive and more fun, so say tuned to hear about all the cool new stuff weâ\\x80\\x99re working on. We want to thank you all for being great users, pushing us to grow and do big things. So thank you all for your continued support, and Happy Picniking!CrunchBase Information',\n",

And with over 400 million users, there&#8217;s also a good chance you have a Facebook account. So what does it look like when those two worlds collide? Like the picture above.As you can see, Facebook status updates per minute exploded at two times yesterday. The first peak, at 2:29 PM PST, is when Zack Parise of theÂ\\xa0U.S. tied the game with a goal in the third period. The second, much larger peak took place at 2:54 PM PST, when Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal for Canada in sudden-death overtime. All told, more than 3.5 million status updates were sent during those two times, according to Facebook. Perhaps even more remarkably, that was twice the pace of updates for the rest of the day.While Twitter has yet to release similar stats, the service also undoubtedly saw an explosion of tweets during those two times. At one point after the U.S. scored, my entire tweet stream except for two tweets was some variation of &#8220;USA USA,&#8221; &#8220;OMFG!! USA,&#8221; &#8220;GOAL HOLY JESUS USA !!!1!!!,&#8221; or the like. Data released a week or so ago had Twitter seeing 50 million tweets per day now.

       "  'comments_content': 'Simply put: Google Chrome is amazing. Ever since it was finally released for the Mac late last year, I&#8217;ve been blown away by its big things (speed) and little things (search box that is also the URL box). But the true power of Chrome may lie in what third-party developers are able to do with it. This is what helped Firefox rip market share away from Internet Explorer over the past several years. Chrome is still young, but already making impressive gains in share each month as well. And the browser could be about to get even better.In a post today on the Chromium Blog, software engineer Erik Kay notes the existence of experimental APIs for Chrome. Basically, these are new APIs that aren&#8217;t yet ready for prime time development, but are available on the dev builds of Chrome for developers to play with right now. The first two experimental APIs available sound very interesting. One, &#8220;experimental processes,&#8221; allows third party developers to access Chrome&#8217;s process model. This allows for extensions that could monitor CPU processes for individual tabs, for example. But the other is potentially more interesting. &#8220;Experimental history&#8221; is described as follows:The history API lets you query and modify the userâ\\x80\\x99s browsing history. When itâ\\x80\\x99s finalized, weâ\\x80\\x99ll also allow you to replace the history page with your own, just like you can replace the new tab page today.While the initial reaction may be to freak out about an extension with such power, Google has so far been very good about keep malicious extensions out of the Chrome Extensions Gallery. While it is mostly open, Google does monitor extensions that attempt to access files on your computer, for example.Still, having a browser API that an extension could use to read your history sounds a bit scary. But imagine some of the cool things it could do too, such as suggest better web pages for you to browse. Or, you could maybe even create a browser-based game that makes you go through this altered history to look for clues on something (seems natural for a movie promotion, or the like).And remember, these are just the first two experimental APIs. The power lies in what else the Chromium team opens up to be modified. Already, Chrome Extensions have stuck it to Firefox ones by being arguably easier to create, and inarguably easier to get to users quickly. Now, it appears that Chrome Extensions are about to get even more powerful. And that should ultimately be good for both web developers and users.[image: Columbia TriStar]CrunchBase Information',\n",

The source said that there were only 300K units available for a March launch, which may put a damper on what we&#8217;re calling iPad Awareness Month.He expects Apple to sell about 1.2 million units in 2010 and 3.5 million in 2011.

Considering he couches all of his terms in analyst speak, there&#8217;s no telling what&#8217;s going on here:&#8220;An unspecified production problem at the iPadâ\\x80\\x99s manufacturer, Hon Hai Precision, will likely limit the launch region to the US and the number of units available to roughly 300K in the month of March,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;far lower than the companyâ\\x80\\x99s initial estimate of 1,000K units. The delay in production ramp will likely impact Appleâ\\x80\\x99s April unit estimate of 800K as well. It is also possible that, given the limited number of units available in March, the launch will be delayed for a month.&#8221;I&#8217;m calling BS.via BrainstormTech',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'New York, the city that never sleeps, may finally meet its match. TechCrunch is coming, and we&#8217;re bringing three days of non-stop conference and startup-competition energy, May 24-26. We call it TechCrunch Disrupt because we want to debate what&#8217;s really changing in media and technology right now, what&#8217;s causing disruption and what we need to do about it to survive and thrive in real time. Each morning, we&#8217;ll explore media and technology disruption themes through hosted panel discussions, keynotes, roundtable conversations and select product demonstrations. We&#8217;ll bring the experts, thought leaders, top entrepreneurs and business leaders and others together to talk about what&#8217;s next. And why. With lots of audience participation.Each afternoon, we take our morning debate into the field. New startups and products will be unveiled and will compete for recognition and a top prize in the Startup Battlefield.This is a tournament-style launch platform where startups demo their products and impress the audience and panel of experts over multiple rounds of competition. Everyone gets stage time to show their stuff, and plenty of direct feedback. But then theyâ\\x80\\x99ll jump into head to head competition with the other startups.Experts and seasoned veterans will be brought in to mentor and judge startups on product, business models, team, design and usability and more. And the final round will put startups in the hot seat where some of the most successful entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and business executives will grill them in front of the audience and see how they perform. It&#8217;ll be a little bit like pitching a top VC, except it will be done live on stage in front of thousands. Audience voting as well as expert feedback will factor into final competition scores.One startup will emerge the overall winner and take home a $50,000 cash prize. But all of the startups get an incredible launch event for their product, and priceless feedback from people who can really help. And, best of all, it&#8217;s free for startups to launch at TechCrunch Disrupt. Save those dollars for your product.Applications open today (March 1) and will be reviewed on a rolling basis through midnight pst, Friday, March 26.  There are no fees to apply or compete in the Startup Battlefield, and startups from around the world are welcome to submit for consideration. In fact, we go out of our way to help non-U.S. startups get the support they need during the application process to maximize their chances.Where can you fit a battlefield in New York City, you ask? We found 100,000 square feet of space in the Soho-West Village neighborhood. We promise you havenâ\\x80\\x99t been to a conference venue like this before. It&#8217;s actually an ex-Merrill Lynch office that&#8217;s available on short-term lease. It&#8217;s a perfect metaphor for disruption. And it gives us almost unlimited room for creativity, exhibits, lounges and demos. In typical TechCrunch style, save room for the after parties each night too.Tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt are on sale now. Best rates are available through March 31.Better to disrupt than be disrupted. Hope to see you there. More details will be coming on the Disrupt Blog.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last week, Citibank found itself in the eye of an Internet storm after it was revealed that the bank had blocked the business account of Web startup fabulis over (non-existing) &#8216;objectionable content&#8217; on the company&#8217;s blog. The topic was all the more sensitive because fabulis operates a social network / lifestyle website targeting gay men.A Citi representative was quick to apologize to fabulis founder Jason Goldberg (see updates to our previous story), but has now taken its official response a step further by reviewing and effectively making changes to its policies around Internet business account customers.Here&#8217;s the note, straight from Citibank&#8217;s online discussion forum (emphasis ours):Citibank Message About Internet Business Accounts At Citibank, we have learned a great deal from recent customer issues related to Internet business accounts. Mistakes were made in some instances, in which we apologized and corrected the problem. These issues made it clear to us that the language in our branch procedures was not specific enough and left too much room for interpretation from one account to the next. We recognized that we needed clearer and less subjective guidelines with regard to opening Internet business accounts. And there were clearly gaps in training and communications around these specific branch procedures. Based on all these learnings, we&#8217;ve taken action and this week we updated and clarified our procedures for opening all Internet business accounts. Banks are required by law to conduct due diligence and understand the nature of business accounts. For Internet business accounts, we have made it clearer to our bankers what the due diligence process entails. For example, we will continue to reserve the right to decline or suspend an account if we find illegal or discriminatory content, or if the site involves gambling or pornography. Beyond that specific due diligence, however, we do not monitor or evaluate our customers&#8217; web content. We are providing additional training in this area to ensure the procedures are uniformly and correctly followed. Also, our bankers are now required to have additional consultation with senior level banking executives when questions arise about these accounts before making any final decisions. This will help to avoid misunderstanding and subjective decisions, and promote greater consistency throughout the process. And we remain committed to working with our customers to try to resolve any issues. As a global organization, we also recognize the power and promise of diversity. In that spirit, we reiterate Citi&#8217;s commitment to serving customers, hiring talent and supporting a broad array of organizations that promote diversity. To learn more about our diversity efforts, please visit: http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citizen/diversity/index.htm. These recent customer issues have been a useful learning experience for us. We again apologize for any misunderstandings that may have occurred. We are committed to improving every day and we&#8217;re working to better serve our customers. I pinged Goldberg about the changes, which have also been communicated to him in an individual e-mail. He says he&#8217;s amazed that while the Obama administration can&#8217;t seem to get banks to change their ways, &#8220;we the people of social media&#8221; can. He adds:How anyone at Citibank could have reviewed fabulis and classified it as &#8220;porn&#8221; is beyond us, and it speaks to how backwards and antiquated its policies were.Amen to that. Still, Citibank is being quite transparent about the whole ordeal and seems to be moving to make amends quickly.What do you think about the whole situation?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Alex van Someren is a &#8220;Dealmaker&#8221; with the Global Entrepreneur Programme at the department of UK Trade and Investment. A serial entrepreneur specialising in IT software and hardware product development businesses, he&#8217;s had two exits through IPOs and is now Entrepreneur in Residence at Judge Business School. Below, he answers our recent guest post which attacked the way UK business regulation authorities treat small but fast-moving startup businesses in the same way as regular, slow-moving ones.Azeem Azharâ\\x80\\x99s article about UK small business bureaucracy doesnâ\\x80\\x99t tally with my own experience running businesses in the UK. In fact, from what other entrepreneurs are telling me itâ\\x80\\x99s a lot easier here than in most developed countries. I wonder whether heâ\\x80\\x99s tried starting a company anywhere else in the world? Just this past Monday I was listening to a guy complain to the Prime Minister at a conference that heâ\\x80\\x99d been to the USA for three weeks and during that time he still hadnâ\\x80\\x99t managed to get a trading subsidiary incorporated there. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done it myself in an afternoon in England.At this point I must declare an interest, because nowadays I work part-time for Her Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s Government as a Dealmaker for the UKTI Global Entrepreneur Programme â\\x80\\x93 supporting start-ups and helping to get more of them to relocate their headquarters to the UK. In my former life I was a serial entrepreneur: since age 19 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve grown four businesses in the UK, from being a self-employed Sole Trader, through two small VAT-registered Limited companies, to a full IPO of a London Stock Exchange-listed PLC. I like to think this makes me better informed, rather than just biased, and of course Iâ\\x80\\x99m writing in my own personal capacity here.My view is that running a business is mainly about overcoming obstacles. Obviously, it would be nice if there were fewer obstacles. Most of the time, itâ\\x80\\x99s true, we have better things to do like polish our products, locate more customers, negotiate with partners etc. But the reason there is government paperwork often has to do with enjoying special perks. If you want limited liability, so you arenâ\\x80\\x99t personally at risk for a business failure, then you have to file accounts and directorship forms at Companies House. If you want to enjoy the autonomy and tax advantages of being able to recover VAT and offset expenses against profits, then you have to provide some supporting information every quarter, all of it online nowadays. If you want to enjoy the really spectacular perks, like tax breaks for capital gains (e.g. the EIS scheme), or tax-free share options (e.g. the EMI scheme), then I think itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty reasonable that you have to fill in a few fairly complex forms, and take the time to get them right, and file them. By the way Azeem: they pay me my VAT by direct bank transfer, so you might want to spend a few more minutes on that HMRC website.So, is everything perfect? Of course not â\\x80\\x93 in particular, small business banking is in a total mess. Itâ\\x80\\x99s shockingly complicated to open a bank account here, and the bankâ\\x80\\x99s cowardly culture means that Anti-Money Laundering regulations and the Data Protection Act are held up as excuses for all manner of obstruction and bureaucracy. As for debt-based borrowing itâ\\x80\\x99s laughably difficult right now, despite the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (which is actually supposed to ensure that the Bank doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even bear the risk if the loan goes bad). Azeem and I are in total agreement about this; even if he did misattribute the quote from Star Wars to Carrie Fisher (it was actually Harrison Ford).So, can we remove more obstacles and make things even simpler for start-ups? Well, weâ\\x80\\x99ve made a fair amount of progress with online filing of Tax and VAT returns. Itâ\\x80\\x99s true that the HMRC website user interface experience plumbs the depths of Government website design (which were already pretty deep), so thereâ\\x80\\x99s another thing Azeem and I agree about. Now weâ\\x80\\x99re starting to hear that politicians from both parties are getting the message about improving transparency of Government, from Gordon Brown adopting Sir Tim Berners-Leeâ\\x80\\x99s open data proposals to David Cameron promising the TED conference that every Government contract over Â£25,000 would be up on a website for all to see, if he was elected. If this trend continues, weâ\\x80\\x99re facing the real prospect of being able to interact with our bureaucratic machinery in real-time over RSS, XML and HTTP. That sounds pretty slick and Web 2.0 to me.I spend some of my time working with entrepreneurs from overseas who are thinking about moving their companies to the UK. They donâ\\x80\\x99t have a totally smooth ride: banks are useless in new and interesting ways; visas have been a problem for some; new procedures are a pain, and of course they feel like a distraction. But business is all about overcoming obstacles, and the obstacles in the UK are generally a lot smaller than elsewhere. The people who are really going to succeed as entrepreneurs are the ones who understand this and just deal with it. Then they can get back to running their businesses, and enjoying the proceeds.',\n",

In addition Shout&#8217;em is throwing in some augmented reality magic into its iPhone app. The Android app is still in progress.According to the startup, users can control control access, look and feel, without requiring any programming or development skill and the networks can be created in minutes. Prior to this, Shoutem had a 11,000 whitelabel networks on its books, including WE Harlem, NFL Shouts and Ranch &#038; Rodeo. CEO Victor Marohnic told me the move was prompted by the fact that people aren&#8217;t able to create their own social mobile communities with location at the core. Shout&#8217;em is increasingly out-iterating much larger but older and slower moving white label social networks like Ning.Backed by seed investment from the Croatian government, Zagreb-based, 25-strong Shout&#8217;em is part of the Five Minutes Group, which is an agency which builds social networking and Web 2.0 services for the likes of Vodafone and Microsoft.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Proceeds from the gifts, which cost between â\\x82¬2.99 ($3.99) and â\\x82¬3.99 ($4.99) and are paid-for via the iPhone&#8217;s &#8216;in-app&#8217; purchasing feature, are being shared with WWF, with 36% of revenue going to the charity.Now I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;ve yet to buy into this whole &#8216;virtual gift&#8217; idea, even if these are in 3D and are a bit more visually appealing than the tiny 2D icon-type gifts exchanged on Facebook, for example. And I&#8217;m also probably not the penguin-hugging, iPhone-touting demographic that Little World Gifts and WWF-UK are targeting. But still, the pricing here seems to be somewhat on the high side and doesn&#8217;t exactly spell impulse buy to me.That&#8217;s likely to be the result of revenue having to be split three ways. First, Apple takes 30% of any iPhone App Store purchase, after which Little World Gifts and WWF are splitting the remainder.Little World Gifts says it will soon be announcing further content partnerships with &#8220;similarly well-loved household name brands&#8221; and that an Android app is in the works.But, as already noted, the company is also going to expand its offering to include location-based gifts so that, for example, if you&#8217;re a tourist visiting London, Little World Gifts could offer to sell you a virtual replica of Big Ben for yourself or to send to someone back home. In fact, it&#8217;s easy to imagine all sorts of virtual souvenirs. And if you visit a particular venue or physical store, you might be rewarded with a free virtual gift as part of said brand&#8217;s marketing efforts. Although, as Foursquare-esque as that may seem, I&#8217;d much rather be given a voucher for a free cup of real coffee for checking into a particular cafe or whatever, rather than receiving some kind of equivalent digital replica. Further integration with social networks, likely to be Facebook initially, is also scheduled later in 2010.The six-person startup has to-date received seed funding from Northwest Vision and Mediaâ\\x80\\x99s Regional Attractive Fund, and are said to in the process of securing a Series A to further expand its virtual goods offering.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'French media conglomerate Vivendi this morning reported financial results, posting a decline in full-year profit but beating estimates because the net loss was much narrower than expected. You can read more analysis of the media and entertainment giant&#8217;s performance elsewhere, but there was a particular passage in the press release regarding Vivendi&#8217;s music subsidiary, Universal Music Group, that caught my eye.UMG, the world&#8217;s largest music company with artists like U2, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna, Eminem, Lil Wayne under contract, as expected finds its revenue from physical product sales (CDs) in a seemingly unstoppable decline. Last year, the company&#8217;s revenues were â\\x82¬4,363 million, a 6.2% decrease compared to 2008.Still, Universal Music Group&#8217;s digital sales grew 8.4% in 2009, which the company attributed to strong growth in online sales yet &#8220;tempered by softening demand for mobile products in the United States and Japan&#8221;.UMG says it will &#8220;continue to encourage and support innovation&#8221;, citing Spotify&#8217;s iPhone application and MusicStation&#8217;s presence on the Android Market as examples. Universal is also a major shareholder of VEVO, a service launched in December, 2009 that quickly rose to become the number 1 music property in the United States. We should note that UMG is also largely responsible for the demise of video sharing site Veoh, and has sued or threatened to sue companies like YouTube, MySpace, Bolt, Grouper and many more to date.Universal Music Group recently appointed Lucian Grainge as Chief Executive Officer of the company, succeeding Doug Morris who remained as Chairman. When the promotion was announced, Jean-Bernard Levy, chairman of the Vivendi Management Board, said:â\\x80\\x9cI am delighted that Lucian Grainge has agreed to move to New York to take on the Chief Executive role. His track record speaks for itself, finding stars, growing revenues and building new business models. He has the right combination of experience and innovation to take UMG forward as the migration into the digital era accelerates.â\\x80\\x9dDo you think Universal Music Group can offset the decline in revenue from physical product sales with a continued increase in digital sales revenue in the foreseeable future?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'When Google Buzz launched three weeks ago, the product wasn&#8217;t ready.  There were basic privacy issues that still needed to be hammered out (and were quickly addressed by Google), but beyond that Google Buzz simply did not work smoothly enough to force feed it to 175 million Gmail users without any warning.  (MG covered some of the usability issues last week).So why was Google Buzz pushed out the door too soon?  I have three interrelated theories:Google still wants to buy Twitter, and putting Buzz into Gmail might be enough of a threat to bring Twitter back to the table. Â\\xa0Buzz did not launch in some Google Labs backwater. Â\\xa0It is placed front and center in Gmail. Â\\xa0Buzz is Google&#8217;s strongest effort yet to enter the stream. Â\\xa0If Buzz can gain traction it would certainly help Google&#8217;s negotiating position with Twitter.Independent of any pressure it may place on Twitter, Google needs to have its own realtime micro-messaging communications system. Â\\xa0The micro-message bus is just a more efficient way to communicate than email for many types of messages so it makes sense to add it as a layer to Gmail: broadcast your public messages via Buzz, and keep private ones on email or chat, all from the same place.The other reason Google needed to establish its own social stream pronto is that links passed through social sharing are beginning to rival search as a primary driver of traffic for many sites. Â\\xa0Part of Google&#8217;s prowess stems from the fact that it is the largest referrer of traffic to many other Websites. It doesn&#8217;t want to lose that status to social sharing streams such as Facebook or Twitter. Â\\xa0Already, Buzz is helping toÂ\\xa0boost sharing through Google Reader. Â\\xa0While Google doesn&#8217;t benefit directly from that traffic (yet), simply knowing what links people are sharing and clicking on is valuable data which can help it improve its search results.Google needed to get into this game as fast as it could, even if there were bumps along the way. Â\\xa0The question now is whether Buzz can keep building.Photo credit: Flickr/ ChelseagirlCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editorâ\\x80\\x99s note:  Guest author Ashkan Karbasfrooshan is the founder and CEO of video site WatchMojo.  Below are his picks for the ten most likely M&amp;A deals in online video.  Previously, he wrote a series if posts about the state of online video (Part I, II, III, and IV).Which online video companies will get bought in 2010? Â\\xa0 Venture capitalists are desperately looking for exits while the usual suspects are sitting on more than $80 billion in cash: Microsoft ($20B), Apple ($40B), Google ($15B), Amazon ($3B), and Yahoo! ($3B) just to name the cash positions of a few potential acquirers. Â\\xa0Theoretically, it should be a match made in heaven, but the sheer number of venture-backed video startups is staggering so when the music stops, not everyone will find a dancing partner.Once you assess what drives companies to merge or acquire one another, however, it seems like weâ\\x80\\x99re about to enter a period of mergers between video competitors and see a series of acquisitions by larger companies looking to accelerate their video strategies, with a common theme being increasing both monetization and margins.Right now, as the chart above shows (click to enlarge), there are two types of online video companies: those with sky-high ad rates but fairly limited inventory (company A) and those with huge inventory but woeful monetization (company B).  Companies can extend profitability through technology, ad solutions or content.With that in mind, letâ\\x80\\x99s look at those 10 potential deals.1. Demand Media will acquire Tremor MediaDemand Media has raised $355 million but to this day still generates the bulk of its revenue from its domain registrar unit, eNom.  However, it is trying to move into the content business, with its â\\x80\\x9cContent Farmâ\\x80\\x9d strategy getting a lot of attention.Demand Mediaâ\\x80\\x99s existing content lends itself better to an arbitrage strategy built around Google marketing and monetization, but over time it will want to do a better job entering both display and video advertising and it will do that by buying one of the many, many video ad networks out there.  Brightroll, which is focused on brands, is one option. Â\\xa0Tremor is another, focusing on reach. Â\\xa0That strategy should fit well with Demand Mediaâ\\x80\\x99s modus operandi. Â\\xa0Tremor Media&#8217;s ads reach 177.6 million uniques, or 85% of internet users.2. Lagardere Groupe will acquire DailymotionAt first glance, French media conglomerate Lagardere seemingly sees no value in communities as a marketing platform: &#8220;There is no clear business model because you have a huge, massive audience, but it is not a marketing community,&#8221; says to Lagardere&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Dominique D&#8217;Hinnin.Monsieur Dâ\\x80\\x99Hinnin might be right, but never underestimate Franceâ\\x80\\x99s sense of nationalism. Dailymotion is Franceâ\\x80\\x99s answer to YouTube and it has taken steps to reduce its share of user-generated and pirated content in favor of professional videos.  (Disclosure: Dailymotion is also one of WatchMojo&#8217;s distribution partners).With $68.5M in fundingâ\\x80\\x94including a tidy sum from Le Fonds Strategique dâ\\x80\\x99investissement, which is an investing arm of the French Stateâ\\x80\\x94you can imagine that one of the pillars of the French media landscape, Lagardere Groupe could eventually step in and acquire Dailymotion despite its admitted monetization problems: â\\x80\\x9cAt the moment, we are poor at monetising our audience,â\\x80\\x9d admits Dailymotion CEO Cedric Tournay.  Lagardere could help with that provided Dailymotion can continue to de-emphasize its less advertiser-friendly content.Additionally, Lagardere will be able to leverage Dailymotionâ\\x80\\x99s audience to promote its own content: the company owns Hachette along with numerous other media entities.3. Scripps will acquire 5MinWhen 5Min (another one of our distribution partners) launched, it focused on user-generated how-to content.  Thankfully for them, they have since moved away from that and currently mesha) aggregated premium and super premium content withb) their monetization engine, a strategy which has propelled 5Min to become a Top 10 comScore video company.Scripps is a producer of super premium content, and like Discovery Holdings, it might prefer to distribute its programming through TV and cable.  But, with consumers viewing more and more videos on the Web, it will need more content for its sites and will look for more inventory online.The two companies already have a strategic deal  in place, so they have some familiarity with each other.4. Google will acquire OoyalaLast year it was rumored that Google was going to acquire Brightcove for $500-700M.  That was always unlikely because many of Brightcoveâ\\x80\\x99s financial backers are the very same media companies that view Google as the bane of their existence. Â\\xa0Moreover, Google makes a lot of acquisitions but rarely are they large (YouTube, DoubleClick and AdMob being the exceptions).A more logical fit to expand its video foothold would be Ooyala, which competes with Brightcove and includes Glam Media and others as clientsâ\\x80¦ and was founded by a former Google executive.Google has the consumer video market cornered with YouTube. Â\\xa0Iit could leverage Ooyala to go after the corporate market by undercutting Brightcove.5. Microsoft will acquire BrightcoveThe consolidation in ad services peaked with Googleâ\\x80\\x99s $3.1 billion acquisition of DoubleClick and Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s $6B acquisition of aQuantive.  After selling ad agency unit Razorfish, today aQuantive is Microsoft Advertising, and as advertising continues to move into video, MSFT will probably want to offer a video content management to go along with the Atlas ad serving platform. Â\\xa0That is where Brightcove fits in.If you think about it, Google owns video search by way of its YouTube acquisition.  Microsoft wants to push into cloud computing and at least conceptually, owning Brightcove would give it a legitimate cloud computing foothold in professional video content with no real threat to any of its core businesses.  It could also better integrate Brightcove (which increasingly powers media companiesâ\\x80\\x99 videos) into Bingâ\\x80\\x99s video search, helping it kill many birds with one (albeit expensive) stone.6. Yahoo! will acquire FreewheelAfter acquiring Blue Lithium and Right Media, Yahoo! got a shot in the arm and grew its advertising reach across the Web, outside of the Yahoo.com property.Freewheel is founded by former DoubleClick employees but Google (which bought DoubleClick) might have less interest than one would think in augmenting its video advertising reach across the Web considering it owns YouTube which accounts for 40% of online video consumption. YouTube only monetizes a small share of the billions of videos on the site.Freewheel, which allows marketers and publishers to manage campaigns across a variety of distribution sites, would be a nice fit with Yahoo!, which might want to extend its Audience Network in video offerings.7. Gannett will acquire LivestreamGannett already invested $10 million in Livestream (then known as Mogulus).The fit is a natural: print media will want to bolster its video offerings (be it content or technology).  The main challenge here is that media companies have grown wary of buying technology firms, but news organizations will have a natural predisposition for all things live and the investment sets the stage up for an all-out acquisition.8. Nielsen will acquire TubeMogulTubeMogulprovides analytics to countless marketers and publishers (we use them at WatchMojo).  Nielsen and comScore are both looking at adding video capabilities and TubeMogul has done a good job of getting wide adoption, providing Nielsen with a quick entry into the burgeoning video space.Also, David Toth, former president, CEO, and co-founder of the NetRatings service joined TubeMogulâ\\x80\\x99s board.9. AOL acquires HowcastAOLâ\\x80\\x99s recent acquisition of StudioNow is a sign of things to come: When AOL was spun off from Time Warner, it was shackled with restrictions on its use of cash and thus the size of the deals it could complete.But AOL wants to create content, lots of it.  AOLâ\\x80\\x99s Tim Armstrong is an investor in Howcast; he was also an investor in Patch, a local startup Armstrong acquired after joining AOL (to his credit, he simply recouped his initial investment and did not participate in the capital gain).Howcast creates videos themselves, lets users create and upload videos and aggregates other professional content (Howcast is one of our distribution partners as well).  While Howcast might have proven redundant with the StudioNow acquisition, AOL has a history of doubling up when it focuses on a space (think ad services: Tacoda, Advertising.com, and Third Screen Media) and Howcast is more focussed on how-to videos.10. News Corp. acquires Break Media from Lionsgate, spins off NewCoNews Corp.â\\x80\\x99s Rupert Murdoch is in the process of divesting from the Web: first selling Photobucket, then chucking Rotten Tomatoes to Flixster while retaining a stake in the new venture. Â\\xa0I see something similar happening with Acquisition #10.Break Media is one of the so-called YouTube clones who has managed to differentiate itself by focusing on the menâ\\x80\\x99s 18-34 market and creating content, be it videos and now video games. Â\\xa0Back in 2007, Lionsgate invested $21 million in stock for a 42% stake in Break.com.  At the time, it also got a call option (basically, the right to buy) which is â\\x80\\x9cexercisable at any time from June 29, 2007 until the earlier of 30 months after June 29, 2007 or a year after a change of control, to purchase all of the remaining 58% equity interests (excluding any subsequent dilutive events), including in-the-money stock options, warrants and other rights, of Break.com for $58 million in cash or common stock, at the companyâ\\x80\\x99s option.â\\x80\\x9dThe 30 month window expired on December 29, 2009, and despite Breakâ\\x80\\x99s momentum, I donâ\\x80\\x99t see any major incentive for Lionsgate to exercise its call option.  I do, however, see the following happening (well, maybeâ\\x80¦).Lionsgate might be more willing to trade its 42% stake in Break Media for a smaller share in a NewCo. that houses both Break Media and News Corp.â\\x80\\x99s IGN Entertainment, another leader in the menâ\\x80\\x99s 18-34 space. (again, bothh Break and IGN are distribution partners). Â\\xa0This NewCo. would then be a more likely candidate for an IPO and would allow both Lionsgate and News Corp. to focus on their core businesses and cash out their investment over time.Needless to say, all of the above deals are idle, if informed, speculation on my part. Â\\xa0What do you think are the most likely video exits this year?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Following the earthquake in Haiti, mobile fundraising via texting exploded; with over $40 million raised via text messaging alone. With the massive success of the Haiti campaign, mobile donations are now being used to raise funds for the victims of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that shook Chile over the past weekend. Mobile giving is fairly simple; you text a keyword to a code on your phone and a micro-donation is made to a given charity. The donation is billed via your carrier. Similar to the Haiti campaign, AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile are waiving text-messaging fees for the donations. According to the Mobile Giving Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, The Salvation Army, The American Red Cross and World Vision are all accepting SMS donations for the Chile earthquake.  Mobile Accord, which ran Haiti mobile fundraising efforts for the Red Cross, is also coordinating SMS fundraising on behalf of several philanthropic foundations raising money for Chile. Via the company&#8217;s mGive program, you can make $10 donations to Friends of the World Food Program, Operation USA, and Convoy of Hope. It&#8217;s unclear whether the fundraising campaign for the Chile earthquake will see the impressive results of the Haiti initiative, but the model did prove to be successful.

For pricing and current promotions, check this page.In other, rather unexpected news, Jimdo investor United Internet has withdrawn from the company&#8217;s board. In May 2009, the international ISP had acquired 30% of the startup and also inked a license deal with the young company that allowed it to have its hosting provider subsidiary 1&amp;1 enable their customers to build Jimdo sites as a white-labeled service.Jimdo co-founder Matthias Henze had this to say about the whole ordeal:&#8220;United Internet has left the board of shareholders. As you know, they mainly invested because of the partnership we had with 1&amp;1. Since 1&amp;1 had different views concerning the roadmap we changed the agreement with 1&amp;1 which now has a license to develop the white-labeled version on its own. I&#8217;m really sorry, but due to signed NDAs I can&#8217;t share any more details on the deal.&#8221;It&#8217;s a bit of a strange development, but Jimdo doesn&#8217;t seem to be all too worried about the ties getting cut &#8211; the company also tells me they&#8217;ve reached profitability with team of 30 full-time employees. We&#8217;ll see how they fare now that they&#8217;re on their own again.    CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note:  Earlier this month, BrightRoll raised a $10 million Series B for its video ad network.  In this guest post, CEO Tod Sacerdoti shares some of the lessons he learned trying to raise that money in the current environment.As Peter Drucker once wrote, â\\x80\\x9cThe entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it and exploits it as an opportunity.&#8221; Put more simply, change is good . . . of course, thatâ\\x80\\x99s unless youâ\\x80\\x99re trying to raise capital in these trying times.After my company BrightRoll recently closed its Series B round of financing, we took a step back to digest the lessons we learned from pitching and negotiating with a handful of VCs over our 6-week fundraising effort.To say raising money in the current economic environment has been different than it was two years ago is a massive understatement. Saying itâ\\x80\\x99s night and day would be more accurate. As a year that was touched off by Sequoiaâ\\x80\\x99s now famous â\\x80\\x9cRIP Good Timesâ\\x80\\x9d presentation, 2009 was highlighted by massive layoffs, significant cost cutting and many well publicized company failures. As a result, many VC firms, and their portfolios, are now fraught with uncertaintyâ\\x80\\x94walking a fine line between licking their wounds thanks to poor fund returns and looking for new opportunities to improve their fortunes as the market recovers.Perhaps the most important lesson gleaned from our financing is that over the last two years, the fundraising environment has become more complex. A still dormant IPO and comparatively sluggish M&amp;A markets offer little hope for the future in terms of exits, while a handful of well-publicized scandals have led to more bureaucratic layers in the due diligence process and a new series of metrics are being used to gauge long-term prospects.Itâ\\x80\\x99s a market in flux, with a whole new set of bestâ\\x80\\x94or worstâ\\x80\\x94practices, depending on how you look at them. What follow are some highlights from BrightRollâ\\x80\\x99s most recent trip down Sand Hill Road.1. The Mint.com Acquisition Left Anything But a Minty Aftertaste in the Mouths of Many on Sand Hill RoadIf you read TechCrunch, you undoubtedly know the story of Mint.com. The winner of the inaugural TechCrunch40, Mint.comâ\\x80\\x99s personal finance application lets users track and monitor their financials.  The company grew by leaps and bounds following its debut and just three years after its founding was acquired by Intuit for $170M.By most accounts Mint.comâ\\x80\\x99s rapid rise to prominence and ultimate acquisition is the quintessential Silicon Valley success story. Yet, the Mint.com acquisition brought to light an interesting phenomenon, one Iâ\\x80\\x99ve coined the â\\x80\\x9cPatzer Problem.â\\x80\\x9d  Prior to submitting offers to invest, three separate VCs wanted to confirm that we had no intention of &#8220;Pulling a Patzer,â\\x80\\x9d modern-day Sand Hill Road parlance for selling too early.Hereâ\\x80\\x99s why: with large funds being raised on Sand Hill Road and returns from previous funds underperforming, investors are becoming increasingly desperate for that single homerun investment that returns $1B or greater. Even though Mint.com was a huge success for the founder and team, generating $60 million in equity value per year, many VCs believe they sold too early and left too much potential value on the table.2. Fraud and Its Impact on the Due Diligence Process In addition to the challenge of getting a term sheet signed, new barriers have emerged that make closing transactions harder than ever.  Chief among them is completing due diligence, which has gone from a relatively efficient and painless series of &#8220;check-the-box&#8221; financial and legal processes, to a full-blown corporate and financial audit.These changes can be primarily attributed to the alleged fraud and ultimate failure of Canopy Financial, a company that raised more than $85 million from FTP and Spectrum. Canopy is alleged to have falsified financial reports and auditing statements and its investors were left holding the bag, which means that other entrepreneurs seeking funding are now paying the price.  To prepare for these changes, companies should make sure to negotiate a cap on legal expenses ($25,000 max) in all term sheets because there is no end to what can be attributed to due diligence under this new model.3.  Perception is Reality, So Prepare Your Third-Party Data As Mark Twain once said, â\\x80\\x9cFacts are stubborn, but statistics are more pliable.â\\x80\\x9d While both companies and venture capitalists often argue that internal logs are both factual and the most accurate source of online traffic data, this data carries little weight when there are millions of dollars at stake. At BrightRoll, we were amazed how many investor decisions relied on metrics provided by comScore and Quantcast, even when the same investors would simultaneously mock the validity of those reports.The lesson here? VCs act like public market investors and perceived leadership may be as valuable as actual leadershipâ\\x80\\x94don&#8217;t forget to put apples-to-apples measurement in place before making your pitch and understand how to explain any discrepancies that may exist between your logs and those of third-party providers.4. New Metric: Revenue vs. Money Raised (RoR) We all know that Rome wasnâ\\x80\\x99t built in a day and that venture investing is by nature one of the most risky investment classes. History has shown that companies pursuing billion dollar exits that VCs covet are often required to spend significant amounts of time and capital in their formative years to build out their product and gain market share.Yet, in what may be a harbinger of things to come, in multiple meetings I was asked to compare BrightRoll&#8217;s annual revenue to the amount of money it had raised in previous years. This is what I now call the Revenue on Raised (RoR) Ratio. If your RoR is greater than one, meaning you generate more revenue every year than your total capital raised, then you are in good health and outperforming most later-stage startups.Just a few years ago, the â\\x80\\x9cPatzer Problemâ\\x80\\x9d and the â\\x80\\x9cRoRâ\\x80\\x9d ratio would have seemed paradoxical. After all, how can a company be expected to pursue a multi-billion dollar opportunity, bring a product to market and generate revenues in excess of the funds they&#8217;ve raised fast enough?  As difficult as it is, that is what companies must do.  Savvy investors now realize that fast time-to-market, and massive market opportunities and significant revenue generation are all possible in todayâ\\x80\\x99s online environment.5. Revenue Growth or Profitability, Pick One There is a perception that in 2009 companies were either reducing head count to get profitable or gaining market share to grow revenue. Yet, in most of our conversations the concept of doing bothâ\\x80\\x94doubling revenue and getting profitable in a down yearâ\\x80\\x94was regarded as the gold standard.Is this thinking the fatal flaw in the venture model? Looking back to early 2009, it would have been a smart move to invest in companies at low valuations to enable them to deliver either revenue growth or profitability, not both. These results would have been achievable through a disciplined approach, focused on several factors, including:Resisting raising too much money before the business was scaling so that achieving a desirable RoR was possible in the short termOnly hiring where desperately needed, to preserve capital to hire through the recession;Together, these small steps can pay dividends when it comes to raising follow-on rounds, particularly during tough economic times.I hope the above lessons help other companies looking to dive into today&#8217;s VC environment, as a little knowledge from the companies that have come before you can go a long way.Photo credit: Flickr/ Steven DamronCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The coverage of the Winter Olympics on NBC has been painful to watch.  In addition to the tape delays which ruined the outcomes for anyone paying attention to any other news, sports or social media outlet other than NBC, there are a lot of other complaints. In between the hard-hitting reports of polar bears in the Canadian North and life among the lumberjacks, NBC did manage to squeeze in some actual Winter games, which were matched in quantity by the constant loop of the same handful of commercials on heavy rotation for McDonald&#8217;s, Visa, AT&amp;T, Diet Coke, and NBC&#8217;s upcoming shows Parenthood and the Marriage Ref.   (Thank goodness for DVRs).We already know that NBC&#8217;s handling of its Olympics coverage sucks, if only because everyone on Twitter says so.  Right now, Twitter Sentiment shows that 73 percent of Tweets about &#8220;NBC Olympics&#8221; are negative.  But what are they complaining about exactly, and is it just Twitter?  Some new data from Crimson Hexagon, another sentiment analysis service for brands, shows the breakdown of hate:Tape Delay Horrible: 19%NBC Is Awful In General: 13%Commentators Are Lacking: 9%Not Enough Sports: 20%Mobile/Web Lousy: 12%Other Complaints: 12%Happily Watching: 15%These numbers come from an analysis of nearly 20,000 Tweets and 5,700 blog posts and forum comments.  On Twitter alone, the biggest complaint by far (25 percent) is the tape delay.  But that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d expect from a bunch of realtime addicts.  Overall when you count blogs and forums that complaint ranked second, barely nudged out by the lack of enough actual sports coverage.  Notably, only 15 of people on the Web were happy with NBC&#8217;s coverage.Perhaps people just go to the Web to complain, and happy viewers had no reason to log on because they were enthralled by those polar bears. But something tells me the Web&#8217;s view reflects the general one.  How do you rate NBC&#8217;s coverage?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A total of 19 Japanese startups were given the chance to show their services at TokyoCamp, a demo event held by TechCrunch Japan (one of the country&#8217;s biggest blogs) this Friday. The event, which was co-organized by hosting company KDDI Web Communications, was a blast and attracted over 200 people this time.This was the third TokyoCamp (see here and here for my previous reports), and here are short profiles of all the startups that presented there. (Please note not all of the services offer English homepages.)Demo 1:AQUSH by Exchange CorporationLaunched by Tokyo-based Exchange Corporation in December last year, AQUSH is a peer-to-peer lending service that is similar to ZOPA in the UK. AQUSH aims to unlock some of the more than US$7 trillion of retail cash and bank deposits (that are earning nearly 0% interest) by offering individual investors access to the US$300 billion Japanese consumer loan market.Lenders set their desired investment amount and interest rates from 4% to 15% for 5 classes of borrower credit risk, as denoted by AQUSH itself. AQUSH loan applicants are screened based on their credit histories, financial situation and FICO scores.The service has been in operation for 2 months and so far the average annualized ROI for investors is 10.58% after fees. AQUSH says for borrowers, interest rates range between 25% to 50% cheaper than available from specialized consumer lending companies.If you can read Japanese, there&#8217;s an in-depth (and fairly recent) article on AQUSH on TechCrunch Japan.Demo 2:Maysee by MoguraJapan is business card country, which means that your average salary man collects hundreds of these cards in any given year. Maysee is a service that scans business cards for clients, corrects OCR errors manually and makes the data accessible via PCs or mobile phones through a web app (for $20 per month per user/$0.35 per business card). The company is currently looking for business partners overseas.Demo 3:Sketch Piston by Team LabSketch Piston is the name of a &#8220;new game genre&#8221; created by Tokyo-based Team Lab. There are two &#8220;Sketch Action&#8221; games available at the moment, Sketch Piston 3 and 4 (both of which were made for Team Lab clients). Players can interact with characters in the Flash games by &#8220;sketching&#8221; various objects with a virtual pen, stamp and eraser. The games have no goal per se, but users can make and share creative gameplay videos on a dedicated platform.Demo 4:Cacoo  by NulabCacoo is a what appears to be a powerful online drawing tool that allows multiple users to create designs collaboratively and in real-time. The designs can be shared with certain users or published on the web, for example on blogs or wiki sites. If you make changes to the designs in Cacoo, the blog or wiki the designs were pasted into gets updated automatically and in real-time, meaning there is no need for another upload.Mainly made for technical illustrations (wireframes, software design diagrams, network diagrams, UMLs etc.), Cacoo is completely browser-based, free and available in English.Demo 5:Link Knowledge by SAN SANLink Knowledge is an SaaS solution with a focus on CRM and SFA (sales force automation). Much like Maysee (profiled above), Link Knowledge digitizes information found on printed business cards, puts the data into context and stores it in the cloud for customers who can then access their data from anywhere they want.Demo 6:WishcoveryWishcovery aims at matching people who have the right skills with those who have uploaded requests or project proposals on the site. The service is scheduled to launch in alpha in April. TechCrunch Japan covered Wishcovery just last month after it won the &#8220;TechCrunch Japan Award&#8221; at the first Startup Weekend Tokyo event.Demo 7:Conyac by anydooRDubbed &#8220;social translation service&#8221;, Conyac is actally based on a virtual currency called &#8220;Conyac Points&#8221;. The way it works is that &#8220;requesters&#8221; need to pay a certain fee upfront, upload a text and indicate which languages the text should be translated into. Registered translators (who don&#8217;t need to get screened or examined) translate texts they think they can handle to earn Conyac points. Those points can then be converted into real money via Paypal, with the service itself getting a 20% cut.Demo 8:LIFEmeeTechCrunch50 demopit company LIFEmee presented a revamped version of their eponymous life management service that will go live early next month. Expect less clutter, a simplified UI, fresh features (i.e. a scheduler) and a new mobile version (scheduled for release next month).Demo 9:Mangaroo by MobakidsMangaroo is a free, social manga service that allows comic artists (amateurs and professionals alike) to upload and share self-created works with other users. Readers can just read the comics, leave comments, bookmark their favorite manga or rate them.Hereâ\\x80\\x99s how a typical &#8220;e-comic&#8221;, submitted by a Mangaroo member, looks like (click to enlarge):Each manga is based on Flash and can be embedded in other websites.Demo 10:meme memo by meme designmeme memo is a free, Flash-based &#8220;pin board&#8221; that can be covered with &#8220;virtual Post-its&#8221;. Each user can set up to ten pin boards (folders) and embed up to 1,000 Post-its (&#8220;cards&#8221;) to scrape, organize and share various information. Some cards require work by the users themselves (i.e. the ToDo card or the address book), but others get updated automatically once you add them to your folder (i.e. the Twitter card or the RSS card). Apart from pure text, it&#8217;s also possible to add videos (YouTube card), images or audio files to the pin board.Demo 11:TwitCasting Live by sidefeedAs one of the few iPhone apps that were shown at TokyoCamp, Twitcasting Live (iTunes link) is a free Twitter client that lets you broadcast (video and audio) live through your Twitter account. The app splits the iPhone screen in half: You can see what you currently broadcast on the top and access your Twitter timeline on the bottom. When you start the recording, Twitcasting tweets a link to your followers who can watch the live broadcast on their PCs or iPhones. The app works with both 3G and Wi-Fi and supports the 3G as well as the 3GS (click here for a demo video).Demo 12:Bang Me!  by DigitalNomadLet me explain the name first: Bang Me! is a wordplay of sorts on the Japanese word for &#8220;program&#8221; or &#8220;show&#8221;, which is pronounced &#8220;ban-gu-mi&#8221; (seriously). Provider DigitalNomad is marketing the downloadable software as a dead-simple video editing tool for beginners or online businesses that don&#8217;t have the budget to produce flashy promo videos.Bang Me! was featured on TechCrunch Japan last month and appeared to be much better than the name suggests (I was told they will change it when the software goes on sale internationally).Demo 13:Hanashirabe by Knowledge SystemIn case you ever stumbled upon a flower whose name you either forgot or were interested to know, Hanashirabe is the solution for you. Just upload a picture of the flower in question, crop it, specify when you took it and the &#8220;flower recognition engine&#8221; will reveal the name of the flower in a heartbeat (demo video).Demo 14:TalknotePitched as &#8220;Yammer for private use&#8221;, Talknote is a micro social communication service that has yet to launch. The main selling point of the service is that it enables multiple users to text-chat across a number of different devices &#8211; virtually in real-time. Talknote will be the first service that allows iPhone users to communicate with owners of regular Japanese handsets this way (PCs, Symbian, Blackberry, Android etc. will eventually be supported as well). The conversations are stored as &#8220;talknotes&#8221; and can be accessed again anytime later. I was able to play around with the iPhone version, which looked pretty nifty already.Demo 15:Qlippy by SpinningWorksPresented for the first time at TokyoCamp, Qlippy is an iPad application that extends to the web in the form of a social network for book lovers. The app will let users download EPUB-based ebooks off the web to read on the iPad. Provider SpinningWorks says readers will also be able to clip pictures or texts on the iPad to create their own scrapbooks. The clipped elements and scrapbooks can be shared with other people on the Qlippy website (demo video).Here is an early screenshot (click to enlarge):Demo 16:waarp by WaaotnKorean transplant Dong Yol Lee has presented a very early version of waarp, his 3D audio augmented, &#8220;eyes-free&#8221; social network system that eliminates the need for a visual UI.Demo 17:Video Analytics by sus4Video Analytics is a freemium-based &#8220;Google Analytics for video&#8221; that&#8217;s especially geared towards e-commerce and education sites. The tool helps to analyze how visitors view videos by breaking down which keywords from search engines are the most effective, how many times a certain video was accessed, how many users watched it from beginning to end, at which points users pushed the stop button etc. All data is visualized online through a Google Analytics-like dashboard.Demo 18:mindiamindia wants to be the online &#8220;encyclopedia of your mind&#8221;. The main idea behind the service is to provide a platform for people to share their viewpoints on any given keyword with the world (in Japanese, at least). Unlike Wikipedia, mindia encourages users to post what they personally think and makes all discussions public, with every member having a specific profile page (example). In other words, mindia is like Wikipedia with a social network built on top of it. The platform is free to use, but there&#8217;s also a solution for enterprises.Demo 19:Fastweet/Fastweet Live by GlucoseTokyo-based startup Glucose presented three Twitter apps for the iPhone. Fastweet is one of the many, many Twitter clients out there and is available in the App Store as a free version (which stores just the latest 200 tweets) or as Fastweet 2K (for $1.99), which keeps the latest 2,000 tweets. Fastweet Live (iTunes link) is a good solution if you search for specific keywords or hashtags. The app then displays just the relevant tweets dynamically, which makes sense during an event or if you want to stay informed continuously on a current hot topic or a specific news item (demo video).The next TokyoCamp will probably take place in April. Thanks to all attendees, startups and co-organizer  KDDI Web Communications, and a sorry to the many people who couldn&#8217;t make it on the guest list this time!Go to TechCrunch Japan&#8217;s Flickr account to see more pictures of the event.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Time was, companies knew how to keep track of their important customers.First, they set up loyalty programs: computerised systems that tracked the monetary value of everyone who shopped in their stores or flew on their planes or ate at their restaurant. When a high spender made a booking, the company was alerted to their status and they were treated accordingly. Frequent fliers got upgrades and champagne, frequent diners got a visit from the chef at their table &#8211; that kind of thing. Anything to ensure that the money kept flowing.And then there was the other way of measuring worth: celebrity. It was understood that if you were (in order of importance) in movies, or on television or a journalist with a significant audience then you would get special treatment too, often for free. Brad Pitt doesn&#8217;t have to mingle with the plebs in the American Airlines lounge, Courteney Cox doesn&#8217;t wait in line at the bank, and the New York Times restaurant critic never has to wait a month for a table at Le Bernardin. If you&#8217;re a business, all of this makes perfect sense: high paying customers are the ones who keep you in business, and celebrities are the ones who guarantee positive mentions in the press. No one messes with Oprah.And for decades the system worked.Sure, the rest of us often found ourselves treated like crap but what were we going to do about it? Write a letter to the company&#8217;s complaints department? Write a furious blog post? Post a negative review on Yelp? Ooooh &#8211; scary! The fact is that, even with Google making it easier than ever to find negative reviews, most large companies couldn&#8217;t care less about individual complaints. The average customer simply didn&#8217;t have the value, the cachet or the audience to cause more than the tiniest PR blip. A $10 gift certificate and a form letter from the head of customer services was enough to make everything better.Frankly, I had absolutely no problem with this system. In fact it suited me just fine. For a start, I&#8217;m a journalist, so people are generally nice to me. But more importantly I&#8217;m a Brit and, as such, any reminder of our old class system &#8211; hereditary peers making the rules and peasants knowing their place &#8211; makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. None of your Thomas Jefferson &#8216;we hold these truths to be self-evident&#8217; colonial bullshit.So can imagine how horrified I was when I picked up a newspaper and realised that something was starting to go very wrong with the established order of things.Two weeks ago, Kevin Smith &#8211; the film maker who brought the world Clerks, Chasing Amy and the character of Silent Bob &#8211; was flying from Oakland to Burbank on Southwest Airlines. Smith, as fans will know, is a big guy to the point where he frequently books two seats when he flies. On this occasion though, there was only one seat available on his flight, so he booked that. Which is where the problems started.Despite having checked Smith in and allowed him to board, the Southwest flight crew suddenly decided &#8211; just before takeoff &#8211; that he was (in his words) &#8216;too fat to fly&#8217;. In front of hundreds of passengers they escorted him off the flight. None of the crew realised he was a celebrity &#8211; he&#8217;s really only famous to stoners and people who have watched Die Hard 4 &#8211; so to them he was just a fat dude who needed to be dealt with.In response to his treatment, Smith did what you&#8217;d do, and what I&#8217;d do: he Tweeted about it. Not once, but a billion times.Dear @SouthwestAir â\\x80\\x93 I know Iâ\\x80\\x99m fat, but was Captain Leysath really justified in throwing me off a flight for which I was already seated?Wanna tell me Iâ\\x80\\x99m too wide for the sky? Totally cool. But fair warning, folks: IF YOU LOOK LIKE ME, YOU MAY BE EJECTED FROM @SOUTHWESTAIR.So, @SouthwestAir, go fuck yourself. I broke no regulation, offered no â\\x80\\x9csafety riskâ\\x80\\x9d (what, was I gonna roll on a fellow passenger?). I was..wrongly ejected from the flightThank God I donâ\\x80\\x99t..embarrass easily (bless you, JERSEY GIRL training). But I donâ\\x80\\x99t sulk off either: so everyday, some new fuck-you Tweets for @SouthwestAir.&#8230;and on and on, to his 1.6m + Twitter followers, many of whom of course retweeted each and every message. But it didn&#8217;t stop there: before long, a host of major news sources had picked up the story &#8211; including many who would never normally write about a cult film maker getting bumped from a flight. The LA Times headline summed up the angle most of them took: Kevin Smith&#8217;s Southwest Airlines incident sets Web all a-Twitter.And that&#8217;s when I realised something interesting, and terrifying: Smith&#8217;s involvement wasn&#8217;t the reason the story was deemed newsworthy; Twitter&#8217;s was.Don&#8217;t believe me? The following week, across the pond and at the other end of the follower spectrum, my friend Robert Loch, founder of the Yes And Club, started his own Twitter fight. His target: One Alfred Place &#8211; a members&#8217; club in London that offers work space for entrepreneurs. The club has recently brought in a new CEO to revitalise its fortunes and her first act was to start axing members who were using facilities too frequently. One of those members happened to mention to her friend Robert that she&#8217;d been booted, prompting him to go into battle on her behalf &#8211; writing a scathing blog post about the club and tweeting the URL&#8230;My thoughts on One Alfred Place&#8217;s appalling treatment of its members. http://tinyurl.com/yds97lmRobert only has a little over 1300 followers, but &#8211; as with Kevin Smith&#8217;s Southwest embarrassment &#8211; the story struck a nerve with enough of them (me included) that we began to retweet it. As did people who saw our retweets, and people who saw those, and so on. By the end of the day, Robert&#8217;s tweet had spread far enough that he was contacted by reporters from most of London&#8217;s major business publications, all wanting details on the &#8220;Twitter revolt&#8221; that he;d sparked. Again, it didn&#8217;t matter that Robert wasn&#8217;t himself particularly newsworthy: Twitter was the angle that interested them.You don&#8217;t have to look far for dozens more examples of this journalistic trend. Just type &#8220;twitter sparks&#8230;&#8221; (no quotes) into Google News and you&#8217;ll find dozens of headlines where Twitter&#8217;s involvement in an otherwise mundane corporate failing has propelled it to the pages of the mainstream media. A random, recent example from those results: &#8220;Artist sparks Twitter campaign against Paperchase over disputed design&#8221; &#8211; another UK-based story, this time concerning &#8216;Hidden Eloise&#8217; an artist who noticed that the upscale stationery company &#8216;Paperchase&#8217; had apparently ripped off one of her designs. She took her fight to her 1,000+ followers and before long the story had been retweeted enough times to become a trending topic. The Guardian quickly picked up the story and forced Paperchase into issuing an embarrassed apology to the artist, and taking steps to make things better.Two years ago, none of this would have been news. A cult film maker was kicked off a flight? So? What was he going to do? Make a film called &#8216;Jay and Silent Bob hate Southwest airlines&#8217;? (Admittedly that would still have been better than Jersey Girl). An entrepreneur&#8217;s got quietly kicked out of a members&#8217; club to make way for more profitable clients? Tough shit: that one&#8217;s not even newsworthy enough for the most desperate trade magazine. A little known designer gets ripped off by a gigantic retail chain? Boo hoo. Tell it to someone who cares. Without a major celebrity angle, there was little to no chance of the media picking up a run-of-the-mill intellectual property complaint and forcing the company into action.But today it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are or how many fans you have. You can have 1.6m like Kevin Smith or you can have 1000 like Hidden Eloise. All that matters is that a) you have a story that tweaks people&#8217;s &#8216;David vs Goliath&#8217; nerve and that b) you get enough people retweeting it that the mainstream press can paint it as a &#8216;Twitter campaign&#8216;.In the past few months Twitter has been promoted daily on network news shows, it&#8217;s been name-checked by Hollywood A-Listers &#8211; hell, it was even mentioned in Dan Brown&#8217;s latest book; wedged in right at the end to keep da kids interested. The result: Twitter itself has become an A-list celebrity. And like with any A-list celebrity, any story that even tangentially involves it is automatically newsworthy.This presents an enormous problem for companies. If Twitter campaigns are inherently newsworthy then anyone with a Twitter account and a gripe against you has the potential to become your biggest global PR nightmare. Pissing off Joe Twitter User is just as dumb, from a PR point of view, as upsetting Will Smith or Donald Trump.Sure, I can hear the response from CEOs and heads of PR. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s ok, we&#8217;re on Twitter already &#8211; if anyone complains we reply to them straight away. We have an intern dedicated to it.&#8221;Yeah.No.Southwest Airlines is on Twitter, One Alfred Place is on Twitter &#8211; even Paperchase finally dragged itself on to the bandwagon a couple of weeks ago. The problem is, official responses, even if accompanied by some kind of grand gesture of apology, do little to quell a Twitter storm once it has started. The phenomenon of mass retweeting means that &#8211; to paraphrase Churchill &#8211; a complaint makes it half way around the world before the official company response has time to put its pants on. Or as the CEO of Paperchase put it to the Telegraph: &#8220;I am sure it can be beneficial but if you get an untruth (on it) it can be    very dangerous.â\\x80\\x9dReally there&#8217;s only one answer &#8211; and it&#8217;s one that strikes at the very heart of the established hierarchy of customer importance. Companies are going to have to start treating every single customer like a VIP. Actually, no, it&#8217;s worse than that &#8211; consider the Hidden Eloise example; she wasn&#8217;t a customer, but just a humble designer. Companies are going to have to start treating every single person in the world like a VIP.In all areas of their business they&#8217;re going to have to make sure they&#8217;re purer than pure; they&#8217;re going to have to examine every one of their processes to ensure that no one is getting screwed over. Moreover, they&#8217;re going to have to treat every complaint like it&#8217;s the most important complaint they&#8217;ve ever received, lest the complainer take their fight to Twitter. In other words, if you&#8217;re going to kick someone off a plane, you had better be sure you&#8217;re kicking them straight into the VIP lounge with a huge gift certificate and possibly even a hot stone massage. Because all of those things are cheaper than cleaning up the mess afterwards.Of course, as a Brit, this horrifies me. I mean, the idea that everyone, regardless of their wealth or fame, should be treated equally by companies just smells a bit&#8230; well, French. Quelle horreur!But as a customer, I have to admit that it&#8217;s about bloody time.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I was out of the country for much of 2009, so it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t until I spent two months back in San Francisco that I noticed a big change in the Web community. Babies. I&#8217;m not talking about whiny Millennials coming out of college and demanding venture capital for their iPhone app. I&#8217;m talking about actual babies. The ones that crawl around the house wearing diapers.In 2006, I co-wrote a BusinessWeek cover story on the then-burgeoning Web 2.0 movement, and one the hallmarks of the scene was a sense of having been burned by the dot com boom and bust. That was when many of the leaders, investors, and foot soldiers of the Web 2.0 movement had moved to Silicon Valley and had their first taste of startup life. As a result many of them, like Max Levchin of PayPal and Slide or Evan Williams of Blogger and Twitter, had lived a rollercoaster of wild life experiences when it came to businessâ\\x80\\x94takeovers, ousters, commanding millions in venture capital, but not much in the way of traditional â\\x80\\x9clife experiences.â\\x80\\x9d You know marriage, kids, and the like. Despite having net worths in the millions of dollars, many of them didnâ\\x80\\x99t even own a house. Many didn&#8217;t think they had time.My, how that has changed. The 30-something Valley generation that moved to the Valley fresh after college, stuck out the crash and got in early on the Web 2.0 movement are now married and having babies. Lots of them.Examples include not only Levchin and Williams, but Jeff Veen of Adaptive Path and now Small Batch, Narendra Rocherolle of WebShots and The Start Project, James Hong of HotorNot, Jason Calacanis of â\\x80\\x9cthe Jason Nation,â\\x80\\x9d Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield of Flickr and now Hunch, Ben and Mena Trott of Six Apart and more. At a recent dinner party at our house, my husband and I looked around the table and realized for the first time in a decade in the Valley we were the only ones without a babysitter. Recently married Phillip Kaplan of FuckedCompany.com/AdBrite/Blippy told me he had big news at lunch the other day and my immediate question was, â\\x80\\x9cAre you having a baby?â\\x80\\x9d&#8220;No,â\\x80\\x9d he replied. â\\x80\\x9cBut given my friends, good guess!â\\x80\\x9d (A few others are expecting but I&#8217;m not outing them here. That&#8217;s private. RIP Valleywag.)Iâ\\x80\\x99ve asked a few people what caused this about face, at a relatively late stage of life compared to elsewhere in the US. Many said itâ\\x80\\x99d taken them a while to find â\\x80\\x9cthe oneâ\\x80\\x9d and once they did, a baby felt right. Many others had gone through the insanity of the dot com bubble, the brutal crash, and then jumped back on the treadmill for Web 2.0. Now in another recession, it just seemed like there should be something more.This kind of thinking would be anathema a few years ago, but several entrepreneurs have said in private conversations, â\\x80\\x9cThis current company could go under, but I still have my family.â\\x80\\x9dTo anywhere else in the US, this may sound â\\x80\\x9cSo what? People have babies all the time.â\\x80\\x9d But in the Valley, this is a staggering injection of work-life balance into the 24/7 Web space. Perhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s just the reality of this generation getting older. After all, the still early-20s Mark Zuckerberg isnâ\\x80\\x99t having kids, neither is the still-acting-in-his-early-20s Kevin Rose. But given the supernova of the late 1990s, itâ\\x80\\x99s a big population of Web influencers and taste-makers that are all of the sudden cooing and speaking in baby-talk.What does this mean? For people like me, who live here, lots of little things, like kids birthday parties and chats about diaper rash. But for the Web, it means something too. This generation has always designed out of need, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve built things theyâ\\x80\\x99d like to exist. My bet is that in the next five years weâ\\x80\\x99re going to see a boom of baby and kid Web and gadget ideas, as the people with the most clout (and in some cases, money) in the Web world start to realize how the rest of 30-somethings in America live.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Twitter appears to be on the verge of some big changes to its website if a tweet that Twitter engineer Alex Payne sent today is any indication. In fact, the new features may be so good that they could make some people re-examine their use of desktop Twitter clients, apparently. As Payne writes:If you had some of the nifty site features that we Twitter employees have, you might not want to use a desktop client. (You will soon.)Not surprisingly, that tweet had a few third-party Twitter developers worried.&#8220;@al3x as a developer, i&#8217;m not sure how to take that looming tweet&#8230;.,&#8221; wrote developer Chad Etzel (who actually used to work part-time at Twitter). Payne immediately repsonded, &#8220;@jazzychad I don&#8217;t mean that developers won&#8217;t be able to compete with the site. We still release most everything API-first, of course.&#8220;While I dabble with both Brizzly and Seesmic Web, I still mainly use Twitter.com day to day, so the prospect of these new, more powerful features excite me. The reason I never got into one of the desktop clients is the same reason I only dabble with Brizzly and Seesmic: The lag in the API (and the rate-limit) annoys me. But that should hopefully change soon with the new Twitter firehose of data.Last year, Twitter added two huge new features to Twitter.com: Lists and Retweets. It&#8217;s hard to imagine what else they&#8217;re working on for the site now. One definite possibility is baked-in geolocation, which Twitter currently offers through its API, but not on the site itself.While new features are great, Twitter has to be careful not to make things too complicated. The core of Twitter has always been its simplicity â\\x80\\x94 if you start tacking on features, that goes away quickly.That said, there is still room for improvement. Certainly, search is one area on the site that could use an upgrade with more options. The upcoming Twitter ads are thought to be built around Twitter Search, so it&#8217;s likely a candidate for an overhaul sometime soon.It&#8217;s worth noting that Twitter also recently hired a new UI guru away from LinkedIn. This was the guy largely responsible for LinkedIn&#8217;s nice iPhone (and other mobile platforms) app. Could Twitter be getting into that game too? And should third-party developers be worried by these moves? Twitter Lists in particular encroached a bit on what services like Brizzly were doing (though they now play nicely together). Any more encroachment and Twitter&#8217;s upcoming developer conference, Chirp, could be very interesting.Update: More from Payne:Uh, everything I like that&#8217;s on the employees-only beta site is actually *built* on public API methods we&#8217;ve already given developers.And:I just mean that our web client team is building cool stuff. It&#8217;s going to inspire desktop app developers. Same data, new perspectives.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Since Facebook started on a college campus, it makes sense that they celebrate kegs. But did you know they actually have a Facebook application dedicated to the keg in their office? And they like to have fun with it.While Keg Presence isn&#8217;t an official Facebook app, it was created and is maintained by Facebook employees. So what does it do? The app is a steady stream of information about what&#8217;s going on with the Facebook keg. For example, Keg Presence sends out notices to let users (other Facebook employees) know what type of beer is in the keg. And when the keg is empty, it posts pictures of BevMo, where Facebook employees apparently go to refill it.Anyway, the application isn&#8217;t new, it has been around since sometime last year, but a humorous update from Keg Presence was recently brought to our attention. Announcing the &#8220;launch&#8221; of Keg Presence 2.0, one Facebook employee jokingly named it &#8220;Facebook Buzz&#8221;:At Facebook we move fast and have already launched Keg Presence 2.0 which we have named Facebook Buzz.80-some Facebook employees gave the update a thumbs up &#8220;like.&#8221;This is of course in reference to Google Buzz, the recently launched social stream feature that now resides inside of Gmail. Following its launch, much was made of Buzz as a potential &#8220;_____ killer,&#8221; including, naturally, Facebook. The social network doesn&#8217;t seem too worried though if their response is a keg application.Update: As former Facebooker Ryan Merket notes in the comments:You forgot one key part of Keg Presence. Employees swipe their RFID badge when they get there, which snaps a photo of them pouring their beer and updates their Facebook status.That&#8217;s just awesome.

       "  'comments_content': 'Good luck sorting this one out, short-sighted lawmakers. An upcoming piece of major legislation in the UK, called the Digital Economy Bill, would essentially force all public wi-fi points offline by requiring impossibly high levels of copyright protection by libraries and small businesses. The bill, which bears some similarity to the controversial DMCA here in the US, is ostensibly aimed at providing copyright holders the means of controlling their content online.But while an ISP may detect a violation by one of its subscribers and send a nastygram to the appropriate party, it&#8217;s difficult to do that when your &#8220;subscriber&#8221; is a pub or cafÃ© that offers free wi-fi to customers. If someone buys a cup of coffee, downloads a few songs, and then leaves and never returns, who is at fault? According to the Digital Economy Bill, the cafÃ©.The question critics pose to the DEB&#8217;s framers is simply: how is justice done in this situation? Clearly the cafÃ© is not really at fault for providing a simple service. On the other hand, if small businesses, universities, and libraries are exempted from copyright oversight legislation, they are at risk (theoretically) of becoming pirate havens. While to the informed internet citizen, the idea of a bunch of hardcore pirates all sharing a 2Mbit DSL line, sucking down bottomless cups of coffee and seeding zero-day Blu-ray rips might seem ludicrous, I assure you: the people in charge are by no means informed internet citizens. So something&#8217;s got to give &mdash; but the industry&#8217;s ignorance is an immovable object, and while you can&#8217;t stop progress, you sure can slow it down.Again, to the advanced internet user (under which heading falls much of this site&#8217;s readership), such backwards legislation much seem unwise &mdash; with a streak of expediency. What with the applicability (if not the fundamental legal base) of copyright being shaken by all manner of P2P, media company inertia, and skyrocketing bandwidth, it seems simply impractical to pass any sort of lasting legislation &mdash; upon shifting sands, as it were. Not that a law should be passed which fails to address obvious copyright violations, but its scope and application should be limited to where it is sure-footed, and as the landscape evolves, further steps can be taken.Should this bill become law, backpedaling will be sure to occur in five or six years, when the flaws in such unilateral proscription produce their inevitable unsavory results. I&#8217;m not familiar with the rest of the DEB, but if it is anywhere near as short-sighted in other matters as it appears to be in this one, it&#8217;s sure to make trouble for UK citizens and lawmakers alike down the road.[image: Joe Mabel, Wikipedia]',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Silicon Valley investors often have a picture in their heads of the type of person who is worthy of funding: young, brash, stubborn, and arrogant. They believe that successful entrepreneurs come from entrepreneurial families and that they start their entrepreneurial journey by selling lemonade while in grade school. Angel investor and entrepreneur, Jason Calacanis said as much in his recent talk to Penn State students. And after meeting Wharton students, VC Fred Wilson expressed shock when a professor told him that you could teach people to be entrepreneurs. Wilson wrote, â\\x80\\x9cI&#8217;ve been working with entrepreneurs for almost 25 years now and it is ingrained in my mind that someone is either born an entrepreneur or is not.â\\x80\\x9dJason, Fred, and Silicon Valley VCs, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got news for you: youâ\\x80\\x99ve got it all wrong. Entrepreneurs arenâ\\x80\\x99t born, theyâ\\x80\\x99re made. And they arenâ\\x80\\x99t anything like you think they are. My team surveyed 549 successful entrepreneurs. We found that the majority didnâ\\x80\\x99t have entrepreneurial parents. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t even have entrepreneurial aspirations while going to school. They simply got tired of working for others, had a great idea they wanted to commercialize, or woke up one day with an urgent desire to build wealth before they retired. So they took the big leap.We found that 52% of the successful entrepreneurs were the first in their immediate families to start a business &#8212; just like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergei Brin, and Russell Simmons (Def Jam founder). Their parents were academics, lawyers, factory workers, priests, bureaucrats, etc. About 39% had an entrepreneurial father, and 7% had an entrepreneurial mother. (Some had both.)Only a quarter caught the entrepreneurial bug when in college. Half didnâ\\x80\\x99t even think about entrepreneurship, and they had little interest in it when in school.There was no significant difference between the success factors or hurdles faced by entrepreneurs who were extremely interested in entrepreneurship in school (and who likely set up the lemonade stands) and the ones who lacked interest. But entrepreneurs with extreme interest started more companies and did it sooner. Of the 24.5% who indicated that they were â\\x80\\x9cextremely interestedâ\\x80\\x9d in becoming entrepreneurs during college, 47.1% went on to start more than two companies (as compared with 32.9% of the overall sample). Sixty-nine percent started their companies within 10 years of working for someone else (as compared to 46.8% of the rest of the sample population).What did affect their successes?Â\\xa0 Education â\\x80\\x94 but not the college they graduate from. In a different study of the 652 CEOs and CTOs of 502 tech companies, we researched the correlation between education and the sales and headcount of companies founded. We learned that the there was a significant difference between companies started by founders with just high-school diplomas and the rest. Education provided a huge advantage. But there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a big difference between firms founded by Ivy-league graduates and the graduates of other universities.The education and training of entrepreneurs is something that the Kauffman Foundation has been researching extensively. Over the last six years, it has invested around $50 million on academic research to understand what makes entrepreneurs tick and what policies are most conducive to entrepreneurship and to construct data bases to permit analyses of these subjects. (Kauffman has also funded some of my research at Duke, UC-Berkeley, and Harvard.) Its VP of Research, Bob Litan, says that Kauffman has learnt conclusively that entrepreneurship can be taught. The key is to provide education at â\\x80\\x9cteachable momentsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 when the entrepreneur is thinking about starting a venture or ready to scale it. What entrepreneurs need isnâ\\x80\\x99t the type of abstract course they teach in business schools, but practical, relevant knowledge.Â\\xa0 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why Kauffman created a program called Fast Trac, which has trained 300,000 entrepreneurs so far.One of the findings of Kauffman research is that of the appx. 600,000 businesses that are started every year,Â\\xa0less than a fraction of 1% become high-growth &#8220;scale&#8221;Â\\xa0businesses. TheseÂ\\xa0new firms, especially the â\\x80\\x9cscaleâ\\x80\\x9d firms, have added all of the net incremental jobs to U.S. economy since 1980 (about 40 million), and probably account for about 1/3 of GDP growth since then.Â\\xa0So the key to boosting economic growth is to increase the number ofÂ\\xa0successful high-growth startups.Â\\xa0 After all, the growth rate of our economy is nothing more than the aggregation of the growth ofÂ\\xa0our firms.That is why Kauffman (which has a $2 billion endowment) is investing heavily in an ambitious new program called Kauffman Labs. Â\\xa0This aims to dramatically increase the ability of small businesses to become big businesses. The Labs programÂ\\xa0is built around a novel idea: that highly motivated individuals with &#8220;scalable ideas&#8221; can be recruited to be entrepreneurs and to be made successful, by surrounding them withÂ\\xa0a network of other experienced entrepreneurs; sources of money; and mentors. The goal is to educate entrepreneurs and surround them with a powerful network. This is like a Y Combinator on steroids.Anecdotal evidence also shows that there are many more factors at play than that of genes. Note this BusinessWeek article about waves of spinoffs from Google. I doubt that all of these Google employees who are starting successful businesses were born with entrepreneurial genes. VC and former entrepreneur Brad Feld also blogged about how many of his frat buddies at MIT had become successful entrepreneurs. Were all of these people born to be entrepreneurs as well? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. It is probably education, exposure to entrepreneurship, and networks that led these people to pursue the entrepreneurial path â\\x80\\x94 which means that Kauffman Foundation may have hit on the right idea with Kauffman Labs.The reason this topic is really important is that, as Wilson writes, â\\x80\\x9cVenture Capital is a lot about pattern recognitionâ\\x80\\x9d. The reality is that VCs like him make quick judgments about people based on the stereotypes in their minds. So, like the women that I wrote about in my previous posts, we may be disadvantaging another important segment of our population â\\x80\\x93 a segment that is older, more humble, more sensible, and more realistic than the population that is getting all the attention (and the money).Editorâ\\x80\\x99s note: Guest writer Vivek Wadhwa is an entrepreneur turned academic.

       "  'comments_content': 'About three weeks ago, eBay&#8217;s electronic payments daughter PayPal suddenly started blocking personal payments going in or coming out of accounts from Indian customers, resulting in a flood of online complaints from the latter that ranged from accusations of racism to sheer amateurism.Last week, rumors that PayPal was actually forced into halting personal payments &lt;a href=&quot;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/banking/finance/finance/RBI-halts-ops-of-remittance-portal-Pay-Pal-in-India/articleshow/5571419.cms&#8221;&gt;by Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) because they did not comply with all relevant regulatory requirements, were confirmed. Last night, PayPal posted a status update on its corporate blog, saying that they anticipate to resume part of its service, namely bank withdrawal abilities, as of Wednesday, March 3rd.From the blog post:We have been diligently working with the RBI and our business partners to resume Indian bank withdrawals for the thousands of Indian businesses who use PayPal to sell their goods or services in the global marketplace.Iâ\\x80\\x99m pleased to tell you that the RBI has now allowed us to resume bank withdrawals for settlements for exports of goods and services. We are currently making changes to comply with Indian regulations for settlements for exports of goods and services, and we anticipate that as of Wednesday, March 3rd, we will be able to resume the bank withdrawal service.As part of the changes, Indian customers will be required to fill out a new field dubbed â\\x80\\x98Export Codeâ\\x80\\x99 when they request a withdrawal (here&#8217;s how to get one). This information is apparently required under current Indian laws in order to identify the nature of cross-border merchant transactions. PayPal will share specific instructions on how users can move money into bank accounts on Monday, March 1st.Update: more details are available here &#8211; PayPal will henceforth require a &#8216;purpose code&#8217; which is different from the Export Code we mentioned above. This code helps users&#8217; banks furnish information that may be required by the Reserve Bank of India to identify the nature of the cross border transaction. But Reserve Bank Of India has informed the eBay company that it requires specific approvals to allow personal inward remittances to India, which it currently does not have. In other words: PayPal is still forced by law to effectively suspend personal payments going into the accounts of its Indian customers for the foreseeable future, unless they are exporters.We&#8217;ll provide an update when that changes.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Efficiency is a business school idea that suggests a company is running smoothly. It&#8217;s absolutely terrific when you&#8217;re talking about a coal mining operation or a Supercuts. But when it comes to a company like Yahoo it&#8217;s not a positive. The Internet is still in its wild west days, and the &#8220;ready, fire, aim&#8221; game plan of Facebook and the other young guns is eating their lunch. Even the massive Google is still trying to shake things up with new and controversial products. Yahoo&#8217;s strategy seems more like &#8220;ready, aim, aim, aim, aim&#8230;&#8221;Yesterday Jordan Rohan at Thomas Weisel Partners described Yahoo in his first analyst report on the company. He thinks this is the right management team to bring more efficiency to Yahoo. But he spends most of his time talking about the negatives, and there&#8217;s no excitement around new products or ideas:For the record, we happen to believe the current management team is the right one at this stage in Yahoo!â\\x80\\x99s corporate evolution. The team is bringing efficiency to a massively inefficient company. Yahoo! is weighed down today by dozens of code bases, thousands of revenue-producing properties, at least three sales force factions (display, search, ad network), and a few thousand â\\x80\\x9cextraâ\\x80\\x9d employees needed to run the media company today due to its complicated legacy assets and far-flung acquisitions.On the upside, he notes that a cyclical upswing in advertising is likely to help Yahoo.Here are a few of the negatives:&#8220;Morale may have rebounded a bit from the trough, but our conversations reveal that morale has a long way to go.&#8221;&#8220;Our recent discussion with Yahoo! management focused more on costs and efficiency than growth.&#8221;&#8220;User behavior is shifting strongly to social and mobile media and away from traditional portals.&#8221;&#8220;Efforts to become more meaningful in social media have been unsuccessful&#8221;&#8220;U.S. assets make up only about onethird of Yahoo!â\\x80\\x99s $21 billion value today&#8221;&#8220;Yahoo!â\\x80\\x99s stock compensation expense is approximately equal to 25% of its annual EBITDA, compared with 11% for GOOG and 13% for EBAY&#8221;More worrying are the metrics comparisons to Facebook. Rohan notes that total minutes spent by U.S. visitors to Facebook are set to surpass Yahoo. And the worldwide numbers are even worse. Facebook now has 160 million daily visitors and 227 billion monthly page views worldwide (Comscore), compared to 160 million and just 94 billion for Yahoo. Yahoo still has tons of daily visitors, but they are spending 12% less time on the site in aggregate compared to a year ago. In the same period Facebook has grown total page views by 217%.Yahoo will continue to shrink as sites are sold off and shuttered, and CEO Carol Bartz works on those efficiency gains. But this is no longer even close to an exciting company that thrives on chaotic creativity. Yahoo&#8217;s foundation is rotten. They have no plan to get back into the game. Or if they do have a plan, no one knows about it. Sadly, the first site many of us ever visited on the Internet is turning into little more than a business school study in financial engineering. It deserved a better fate.CrunchBase Information',\n",

If you&#8217;ve taken a break from jamming on the &#8220;Update&#8221; button, it&#8217;s time to go tap it one last time: the rollout of webOS 1.4 has just begun. The catch: it seems that it&#8217;s only for Sprint handsets right now (Update: In the US, that is &#8211; it&#8217;s also available on O2 UK, O2 Germany, O2 Ireland, and Movistar in Europe), with the Verizon Pre Plus and Pixi Plus still reporting that 1.3 is the latest release.We knew it was coming in February thanks to Palm&#8217;s announcement at CES &#8212; and thanks to the rumor mill, we were all lead to believe it was coming a few weeks ago. All false starts and false hopes aside, it&#8217;s available now. We&#8217;re seeing reports (thanks Twitter!) that it has gone live on Sprint handsets. Curiously absent, however, are any reports of the update hitting Verizon Pre/Pixi Pluses. With the update going out this late in the evening (a bit after 10:30 pm PST), I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised if there were some last-minute snags; might the Verizon update have been held at the last minute?  The biggest new feature in webOS 1.4 &#8212; at least, of those available right this second &#8212; is its new found ability to record and edit video. webOS also lays all the necessary foundation for Adobe Flash support, though that bit will come as a download from the App Catalog at a later time. There are other smaller features and bug fixes throughout &#8212; for those, check out the full change log below. (Update: Palm has just released an even bigger, more in-depth change log here)Changelog:Enhancements:- Updated SMS and chat features.â\\x88\\x92 Tap and hold on an email address to send an email or addto contacts.â\\x88\\x92 Forward SMS messages to email.â\\x88\\x92 Dial a number from chat view without opening a contact card.â\\x88\\x92 Press and hold a phone number (identified via smart text) to getmore options for calls and SMS.- New camera support for video capture.â\\x88\\x92 Record and edit videos right on your device.â\\x88\\x92 Upload videos to YouTubeÂ® and FacebookÂ®, or send them to friends via email or MMS.- Expanded calendar and task functions.â\\x88\\x92 Set custom alert sounds for calendar events.-View times with added AM/PM and Now indicators. â\\x88\\x92 Dial phone numbers shown in the appointment subject.- More email optionsâ\\x88\\x92 Customize your email alerts by specifying a distinct ringtone orselecting mute or vibrate.â\\x88\\x92 Tap and hold on a phone number or email address to either dial orsend an email or add to contacts.â\\x88\\x92 Once emails are sent, youâ\\x80\\x99re taken back to the inbox view.â\\x88\\x92 More sort options for messages, including by date, sender,and subject.- Mobile Hotspot application is now preloaded on the device. &#8211; Enhanced universal search now includes Global Address Lookup, i.e.,corporate address book.- The light bar in the gesture area now blinks whenever there arepending notifications.Improvements:- Better MMS functions and support.â\\x88\\x92 Support for sending an MMS message when connected to Wi-Finow included.â\\x88\\x92 MMS messages with multiple audio and picture attachments nowallow you to open all attachments correctly.â\\x88\\x92 MMS display updated so messages no longer appear to overlapeach other.- Faster performance in several areas of the phone and calendar applications-',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber wrote what I thought was a good response to my post about Apple&#8217;s App Store sexy app policy. While I noted that one of the reasons Apple&#8217;s policy was silly was because each iPhone contains two apps, iTunes and Safari (both made by Apple), that grant users access to content much worse than the kind of stuff now being banned from the App Store, he comes back to say that maybe the idea isn&#8217;t to remove this content from the iPhone itself, but rather just from the actual App Store.My first reaction to this was the humorous thought that both iTunes and Safari would be banned from the App Store had they not been included by default on every iPhone. But that actually lead to a more interesting thought that a few other posts around the web back up today: Safari is the iPhone&#8217;s peephole.What I mean is that Apple very tightly controls nearly every aspect of the iPhone (and really, all products). While they undoubtedly have both selfish (app revenues) and unselfish (protection) reasons for doing this, this type of suffocating control should be enough to make users walk away. But it&#8217;s not. And a big reason may be Safari.Think about it: you can&#8217;t have porn on your iPhone â\\x80\\x94 but actually, you can. You just have to go through Safari. You can&#8217;t have Google Voice on your iPhone â\\x80\\x94 but actually, you can. You just have to go through Safari. Other Google Apps? Same thing.Sure, it&#8217;s not as easy or as nice as if there were a native app experience, but it&#8217;s doable. And as HTML5 continues to mature, it will be more and more doable. In fact, over the past few months I&#8217;ve encountered a number of web apps on the iPhone that are increasingly impressive. One is the Google Buzz app, which is better than Google Buzz on the desktop because it uses HTML5 to access your location through your phone.Remember, when the iPhone first launched in 2007, no native third-party apps were allowed. All Apple said at the time was that if you wanted to make an app, it had to be a web app. The problem was that the HTML5 was basically non-existant at the time, and the older HTML/JavaScript/CSS combination simply wasn&#8217;t ideal for developers or users. So Apple shuffled (though native apps may have been the plan all along, who knows), and made third-party native apps the norm with the launch of the iPhone SDK.Unfortunately, as we&#8217;ve all become well aware, there&#8217;s a price for this native development: you have to play by Apple&#8217;s rules. But, at the same time, Apple never said you still couldn&#8217;t work outside the App Store ecosystem and make any sort of web app you desired. Again, essentially, they made Safari a loophole â\\x80\\x94 or, as I&#8217;ve been calling it, a peephole.Today, Gruber elaborated on this a bit buried in his post about Adobe Flash. Here&#8217;s the key part:The best counter-argument is perhaps that, given Appleâ\\x80\\x99s desire for control, theyâ\\x80\\x99re always going to prefer their wholly owned proprietary platforms â\\x80\\x94 native iPhone and Mac apps â\\x80\\x94 over the web, and will eventually come to see the web as a threat. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Apple sees it that way, though. There is always going to be a lowest common denominator platform. That used to be Windows. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s the web. Apple doesnâ\\x80\\x99t build lowest common denominator platforms. Before, when Windows was the LCD, Apple was in a hard place because they were locked out of that platform: their platform was at odds with it. Now, with the web as the LCD, Apple has it both ways: their platforms gracefully coexist with it. Apple isnâ\\x80\\x99t a web company, but the web might be the best thing that ever happened to them.So with the web, Apple is giving both developers and users a way to still operate outside the system. And again, that method will keep improving as HTML5 does.In fact, I&#8217;m surprised that Apple doesn&#8217;t play this up more in response to the criticisms of the App Store. If I were them, I&#8217;d simply say something like, &#8220;We made the App Store to provide our customers with the best guaranteed experience on their device. If you&#8217;d like an app that we don&#8217;t allow, that&#8217;s fine, you&#8217;ll just have to access it through the web on the device.&#8221;The first part essentially is their line, but the second part they probably won&#8217;t say because then they&#8217;ll worry customers will start associating the web apps with Apple itself. But again, that was the initial idea behind the first iPhone, so if they thought it was going to work at one time, they should be comfortable with it now.Another post today on Silicon Alley Insider notes that Apple is stacking the deck against its rivals like Amazon for digital goods because you can&#8217;t buy them within native iPhone (and soon iPad) apps. For example, with the Amazon Kindle app, you have to go to the web to purchase a new e-book.But again, it&#8217;s not that you flat out cannot buy the book, you just have to go to the web to do it. And you can do that on the iPhone, through Safari. It&#8217;s a little more complicated, but it&#8217;s manageable.Ideally, would Apple like to all the most popular web apps ported over to native apps available in the App Store? Provided they adhere to their guidelines, of course. At the same time, are they ever going to remove Safari from the iPhone and make all developers do native apps? No way. It would be suicide to do so. And Apple must know that.You cannot remove the safety net just because you think not falling is better than falling.Instead, Apple will focus on making a platform for developers that allows them to create a better tailored experience for users, provided they follow their rules. We see this with apps like Facebook, Pandora, and a number of Twitter apps. Each is better than their respective web app (well, except that you can&#8217;t run Pandora in the background, but that may change â\\x80\\x94 soon). And each are among the most popular apps on the device.Meanwhile, I&#8217;m using Google Voice, Buzz, and Gmail on my phone â\\x80\\x94 I&#8217;m just using them through Safari. I thought it would bug me, but it really doesn&#8217;t because HTML5 is getting so good.Is Apple still hypocritical in not allowing some sexy apps but allowing others? Yes. And it&#8217;s particularly bad because they initially didn&#8217;t allow them, then they did, now they&#8217;ve taken them away again. And it&#8217;s sad that this is destroying some businesses (no matter what you think of the content). But you still could get this content through the web using Safari. It sucks for the developers that they can&#8217;t as easily charge for it, but end users obviously won&#8217;t care about that. And those are the people buying iPhones.The iPhone may be a closed door, but there is a peephole, Safari. And if you can&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for on the device, you might want to look through it.[photo: flickr/wfyurasko]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Hamburg, Germany based Qype, a Yelp-like site that&#8217;s focused on European markets, has recently had long acquisition looks from both Google and Nokia, we&#8217;ve heard from multiple sources. A deal with Nokia in particular was looking extremely likely until recently.The site was first launched in 2005 and today attracts 9 million monthly worldwide visitors, according to Comscore, just a little less than Yelp&#8217;s 11 million. Both likely have far more actual visitors, but Comscore is good for comparision &#8211; in December, for example, Qype told us they had 17.7 million unique visitors. A year ago the company brought in a new CEO and have been expanding rapidly across Europe.Google supposedly took a look at the company and passed, opting instead to just import Qype&#8217;s content. Nokia made a run for the company after Google, with one source saying that a term sheet had been signed in the $50 million range. But another source says that a term sheet was never signed and the deal negotiations broke down over both price and other contract terms.Qype isn&#8217;t helping much with the story, sticking to their no comments. But founder Stephan Uhrenbacher did email to tell us that the site has 500,000 registered users who&#8217;ve left over 1 million reviews. They are available in seven languages and have sites in UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Brazil, Ireland.So for now at least Qype may remain independent. But like Yelp, which had its own acquisition drama late last year, Qype is in the local advertising sweet spot, where billions of advertising dollars (and euros) will be flowing over the next few years. Qype has raised around Â£8 million in venture capital.CrunchBase Information',\n",

But it wasn&#8217;t Huffduffer&#8217;s service that got Luke W animated, so much as their sign-up page.While most sites use a standard form with text-boxes and radio buttons for new sign-ups, Huffduffer presents its questions as a &#8216;Mad Lib&#8217; style statement&#8230;&#8220;I would like to use Huffduffer.

So he persuaded Ron Kurti at Vast.com to do some A/B testing and, whaddya know?, it turns out the conversational fill-in-the-blanks form increased conversion by 25-40%.Given those impressive numbers it&#8217;s a cast iron certainty that in the next few months dozens of sites, starting probably with Yahoo!, will consider upgrading their sign-up pages to this new, friendlier format.

Today, my inbox exploded.It seems that just about every company, advertiser, and even plenty of users associated with the location space emailed me with pitches, ideas, thoughts, etc. To say that space is red-hot right now, is putting it mildly. One of the companies that reached out to me was Brightkite, one of the earliest hot location players.CMO and co-founder Rob Lawson admits that the network has been &#8220;pretty quiet for a while,&#8221; but hints at some exciting stuff coming up for March (yes, around the time of SXSW). But he also wanted to share some things they&#8217;re working on right now, and a few interesting bits of data.Notably, Brightkite has over 2 million active users currently around the world. While that might seem small compared to the bigger social networks like Facebook and Twitter, that&#8217;s actually four times the size of the newer rival Foursquare, that is getting much of the hype these days. Another interesting tidbit: Brightkite has had localized promotions in place for some time now, and they&#8217;re seeing strong usage.What users of Foursquare may know as check-in or mayor special, Brightkite calls Local Promotions. And they have a page on the site where local businesses can sign up for free. On that page, they note:We would love to help your bar, cafe, coffee shop, or business reach out to the local community through local promotions. We&#8217;ll let nearby Brightkite folk know your business gives them preferential treatment, and that they should stop in for a visit. Fill out the form below to get started.Brightkite says these promotions are seeing a lot of interest from all types of brands. And usage is strong with over 100 brands including big ones like Gap, Ben &amp; Jerryâ\\x80\\x99s and Time Warner Cable, seeing over two percent response rates when these notifications are inserted into users stream. And the best ones are seeing five to ten percent. When compared to more traditional ads, those numbers are very solid.Like Foursquare check-in and mayor specials, the Brightkite deals offer things like free (or heavily discounted) drinks and meals, but also extend to things like discounted hotel rooms, car rentals, and even dry cleaning.So is Brightkite making any money off of these? Yes. While many of the smaller local businesses use the service for free or close to free (to both prove the model and drive growth), Lawson notes that some of the big national brands are spending some big time money to advertise locally. These campaigns range from $10,000 to $200,000, Lawson says.Something else that interests me about Brightkite is their unique approach to social relationships. When it started, Brightkite had a symmetrical model, much like Facebook and Foursquare, which requires users to accept each other as friends. But late last year, the company switched the model to be an asymmetrical one, like Twitter, where one party can follow another without permission.This may seem like a horrible idea for a location-based service given the privacy implications, but Brightkite&#8217;s is a bit different of an asymmetrical model. &#8220;Our model is asymmetrical (like Twitter), but reversed. With Twitter, you decide who to follow but anyone can see your content. Â\\xa0With Brightkite, you decide who to share your content with, but you can only see others if they decide to share with you,&#8221; Lawson notes. He continues, &#8220;We are convinced this is the right model for location based services &#8211; people want to be in control of who knows where they are. We turned away from the handshake model (Facebook, Foursquare) because we found users didn&#8217;t like the social pressure of having to accept a friend request. Just because you are happy to share your location with me, doesn&#8217;t mean I want to share mine with you, even though we want to maintain a relationship.&#8220;As someone who has dealt with this many times before, I see his point. Lawson says that generally Brightkite users have been receptive to the changes, but says that some older users liked some of the more advanced features of the old model better â\\x80\\x94 and Brightkite is working to get some best-of-both-worlds options for them.Brightkite merged with another location-based network, Limbo, last year and raised some new funding. They face a battle in warding off the fast-charging hot location networks like Foursquare and Gowalla (not to mention Yelp and the new Google Buzz), but all of them appear to be benefiting from brand interest in the local advertising space.CrunchBase Information',\n",

He was right on both counts.Grooveshark now says it has given up on its ambitions to get approved for the official App Store, claiming that Apple has been &#8220;ritually rejecting&#8221; the app for &#8220;primary selfish reasons&#8221;. We&#8217;ve heard that song before. The startup says it spent many months developing the iPhone application, and on occasion went months without a hearing a peep out of Cupertino.Denied access to the App Store, Grooveshark decided to head underground and is today releasing the app on Cydia, enabling people who have jailbroken their iPhone and iPod touch devices to enjoy it &#8211; and it is actually pretty cool.Much like Spotify &#8211; who, for the record, has seen its iPhone app approved by Apple &#8211; premium aka VIP users of Grooveshark can use the app to search for tracks within a gigantic catalog of music at lightning speed and instantly stream them from the device. Playlists, favorites and whatnot are completely synced, so the experience for paying Grooveshark users who happen to have a jailbroken device are now able to basically get the exact same experience on their iPhone or iPod touch than using the recently revamped Web application.The app also enables you to make tracks and entire playlists available offline, so you can enjoy the music even without the need to be connected.All in all, it&#8217;s simply a great application that many would love to have to their iPhones, I&#8217;m sure. At the very least, for those people there now exists an option to get it installed on there, despite Apple. Or they can just go out and buy any rival device that runs Android, or go get a Blackberry, or purchase a recent Palm phone &#8230;CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Earlier this week, news broke that the EU was opening an antitrust investigation into GoogleÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0and Microsoft&#8217;s fingerprints were all over it.  One of the three companies filing complaints about Google is owned by Microsoft, while another is a member of a group that&#8217;s partially funded by them.  Google promptly responded to the inquiry with a blog post called &#8220;Committed to competing fairly&#8221; that gave a brief overview of how its search rankings work.Today, Microsoft has written a blog post that admits that it played a part in instigating the inquiry, stating that &#8220;complaints in competition law cases usually come from competitors.&#8221; And it&#8217;s also accusing Google of &#8220;telling reporters that antitrust concerns about search are not real because some of the complaints come from one of its last remaining search competitors.&#8221;Microsoft&#8217;s post, which was written by  VP and Deputy General Counsel Dave Heiner, details some of the company&#8217;s recent discussions with the European Commission and US DOJ, which have revolved around the Microsoft/Yahoo search deal (which, in turn, led to talk about Google&#8217;s allegedly anticompetitive practices).  Heiner also notes that Microsoft has been directing other &#8220;concerned companies&#8221; to competition law agencies.Here are some of the more interesting passages:As Googleâ\\x80\\x99s power has grown in recent years, weâ\\x80\\x99ve increasingly heard complaints from a range of firmsâ\\x80\\x94large and smallâ\\x80\\x94about a wide variety of Google business practices. Some of the complaints just reflect aggressive business stances taken by Google. Some reflect the secrecy with which Google operates in many areas. Some appear to raise serious antitrust issues. As you might expect, many concerned companies have come to us and asked us for our reaction and even for advice. When their antitrust concerns appear to be substantial, we suggest that firms talk to the competition law agencies. (Complaining to Microsoft wonâ\\x80\\x99t do much good.)Both search and online advertising are increasingly controlled by a single firm, Google. That can be a problem because Googleâ\\x80\\x99s business is helped along by significant network effects (just like the PC operating system business). Search engine algorithms â\\x80\\x9clearnâ\\x80\\x9d by observing how users interact with search results. Googleâ\\x80\\x99s algorithms learn less common search terms better than others because many more people are conducting searches on these terms on Google.These and other network effects make it hard for competing search engines to catch up. Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s well-received Bing search engine is addressing this challenge by offering innovations  in areas that are less dependent on volume. But Bing needs to gain volume too, in order to increase the relevance of search results for less common search terms. That is why Microsoft and Yahoo! are combining their search volumes. And that is why we are concerned about Google business practices that tend to lock in publishers and advertisers and make it harder for Microsoft to gain search volume.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'One of the more frustrating things about shopping for electronics is the fact that many devices don&#8217;t hold their value for very long â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you can&#8217;t typically buy a cell phone and expect to sell it for $200 a year later.  At least, that&#8217;s how it used to be.  Now Palo Alto-based startup Ztail is teaming with online mobile phone retailer  LetsTalk to do exactly that for mobile phones: buy a phone through LetsTalk, and Ztail will tell you on the spot exactly how much money they&#8217;ll give you 18 months down the line if you want to sell it back.Here&#8217;s how it works. LetsTalk now features a &#8216;ValueLock&#8217; banner for the vast majority of its phones, including popular devices like the Motorola Droid (ValueLock is essentially a branded version of Ztail&#8217;s service).  Each phone has a ValueLock Price, which is the amount Ztail will pay if you decide to send in your phone up to 18 months later (this price is the same no matter when you send in your phone, up to the 18 month cutoff).  The catch is that in order to redeem your ValueLock deal, you have to purchase your next phone through LetsTalk too.  The site appears to have competitive prices, so this shouldn&#8217;t be a huge deal.From what I can tell, Ztail is offering up some good prices for the used phones.  The ValueLock price for a Droid is set at $196, which is nearly $150 more than you pay for the phone up front with a 2-year Verizon contract (and remember, you&#8217;re going to get that after using the phone for 18 months). After sending in your device, Ztail sends you your money either through check or PayPal.  And CEO Bill Hudak says that trade-in phones don&#8217;t have to be in mint condition either â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it just can&#8217;t have obvious flaws like water damage, cracks, and missing buttons. And, in the event that Ztail goes under some time after you buy your phones, LetsTalk will still back these pricing guarantees.So how does Ztail make money from this?  First, they receive a commission for every user that buys a phone and then decides to sign up for the ValueLock service, which only requires an Email address and takes a few seconds to do. Hudak says that during a trial run 30% of customers who were eligible for ValueLock signed up for it (they&#8217;re prompted to both by an Email from LetsTalk and a card sent alongside each device).  Ztail also gets a substantially larger second commission down the line if the customer sends in their device through ValueLock and purchases their next phone through LetsTalk.This is big news for Ztail â\\x80\\x94 LetsTalk is one of the web&#8217;s largest phone retailers, with over $100 million a year in revenue and hundreds of thousands of activated phones sold each year.  Ztail has been working on this pseudo-insuranceÂ\\xa0model for nearly a year, and it also has more large partnerships in the works (it&#8217;s also worth pointing out that LetsTalk powers the mobile device store on WalMart.com, so it&#8217;s possible that their partnership may extend there) . Prior to launching this business model, Ztail had previously focused on streamlining eBay listings and also launched a &#8216;Kelley Blue Book For Everything&#8221; in 2008.If you&#8217;d like to try out the system for yourself, Ztail is going to offer a $230 ValueLock price on the newÂ\\xa0Motorola Devour to TechCrunch readers (use the code &#8216;TCDEVOUR&#8217; when you sign up for the service).  The normal ValueLock price for the phone is $168.  You can read our review of the Devour here.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Seesmic just updated its Android app, bringing it closer to the the Twitter apps for the iPhone. Today, Seesmic is rolling out a powerful new version of its BlackBerry app. The new version includes support for multi-accounts, Ping.fm integration (Seesmic acquired Ping.fm earlier this year) and the ability to choose your photo uploading size. So if you have more than one Twitter account, you can set Seesmic to remember all of your accounts, and easily switch between them. You can also cross-post messages between different accounts at the same time. The app allows you to set up default account which will be generated each time you open Seesmic for BlackBerry. You can add up to ten accounts with the new feature.Ping.gm integration allows for you to post your updates to 50 social networks at the same time. In order to engage the feature, you&#8217;ll need to start a Ping.fm account. Seesmic for BlackBerry also includes the ability to share pictures through Tweetphoto now. You&#8217;ll still be able to post photos with yFrog, which was the photo app the client launched with, but Tweetphoto is now the default.  And now you can also select the size of the photos you wish to post. You&#8217;ll be given the choice of opting between small, medium or large images. Sessmic made updates to its BlackBerry client in December but multi-account and Ping.fm support is huge for the client. This latest update should make Seesmic&#8217;s client the most feature-rich app out there.  Of course BlackBerry has launched the private beta of its Twitter app which is missing a few key features and has been receiving mediocre reviews.TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington is an investor in Seesmic but I am not.

       "  'comments_content': 'When it comes to user discovery, the best way for services to do it is to use your profile information. Basic things like your name, location, bio, and email are all helpful ways for other people to find you on a network. The problem is that a lot of users don&#8217;t bother to fill this out when they sign up for a service. So Twitter is now prompting existing users to do so.A new overlay has started popping up on the service called &#8220;Be found on Twitter.&#8221; This randomly appears (it did for me a few minutes ago) when you load up twitter.com. It reads, &#8220;We were hoping you could help us make it easier for people to discover their friends and colleagues on Twitter. Review your settings below to make sure the people you care about can easily find you.&#8221; It then asks for your name, bio, location, email, and phone number. If you&#8217;ve already filled these out, it includes what you previously put down.Both the bio and location fields are optional, but everything else, you need to fill out (unless you click on &#8220;Ask me later&#8221; which presumably will bring up this prompt again). You can also decide whether or not to let people find you by your email address or phone number in searches.Looks like Twitter wants to tighten that social graph a bit. With site growth in the right direction again, and tweeting at an all time high, it&#8217;s probably a good call.

Each of the tabs stays on every page you visit in Yahoo Answers. &#8220;Home&#8221; brings you to the homepage which includes a rotating Best of Answers feature, the link to the Answers Blog and more. &#8220;My activity&#8221; lets you access your Answers profile, and view your activity on the site.  &#8220;About&#8221; features the Community Guidelines, answers leaderboard, Suggestion Board,  and links to the Answers blog. Browse Categories: Yahoo has redesigned the feature to browse answers by categories. On the previous version of the Answers homepage, all of the categories were displayed on the left hand column, which Yahoo says took up prime landscape on the homepage. Now, Categories is featured in a navigation tab within a hide-away menu. So you can always see the categories on any page via the drop down feature of the &#8220;Browse Categories&#8221; tab. And you can also lick on the tab j to be taken to the â\\x80\\x9cAll Categoriesâ\\x80\\x9d page. From this page, you can access all the questions that are open, resolved or in voting on the site.Aesthetics: Yahoo has slightly changed the background color of the Answers page; toning down the green and replacing the white background with a light blue palate.  Even the smiley icons have received a facelift. With the removal of the categories section, the homepage is a bit more cluttered and roomier. Yahoo says that the backend of the site has been fixed to eliminate a few bugs. Answer category leaderboards will now be updated on a daily basis instead of weekly.While Yahoo Answers is still one of the leaders in the Q&amp;A space, the site is now facing competition from startups who are innovating in the space, including Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake&#8217;s Hunch.

       "  'comments_content': 'Anyone who has lived in New York, knows the hassle and stress of finding an apartment that fits within their budgets and has enough space to live in. New startup Naked Apartments attempts to ease the process by being a sort of Match.com for renters and landlords and apartment brokers. The site matches qualified renters with brokers and landlords, automating the process of finding an apartments that meet renters&#8217; search criteria. Here&#8217;s how it works. Renters sign up, creating anonymous profiles that feature key statistics such as annual income, desired monthly rent, their desired apartment size, location and move-in date. Naked Apartments will also supplement that information with a free credit check, which means that the completed profile includes a renterâ\\x80\\x99s credit score range. Brokers and landlords can get access to the anonymous profiles and choose to contact the renters that meet their financial requirements and have matching interests in their rental properties.The catch is that brokers and landlords have to buy credits in order to contact each renter. Landlords pay $2 to contact a renter. Once a brokers contact renters with their rental properties, renters can choose whom to exchange contact information with and which apartments to see. The idea is that after renters work with a broker or landlord, they write reviews of their experience, helping other renters know which brokers and landlords to trust and how to navigate the watersNaked Apartments also allows renters to take a more active approach and browse its listings database. Similar to Craigslist, the site allows renters to contact  brokers and landlords  to find out more about the property. Since the site&#8217;s launch, 2000 renters have found apartments through the system, through 100 brokers and landlords.  Currently, Naked Apartments lists 13,000 apartments for rent. The idea of Naked Apartments is compelling but like many rental listings sites out there, it will face strong competition from Craigslist. And Zillow, which catered to home sales previously, is now offering rental listings. CrunchBase Information',\n",

Announced in March 2009, the Founder Institute offers entrepreneurs and very early stage startups an environment designed to help foster their growth and education. The program, which is now active in nine cities worldwide, holds two four-month long sessions annually in each location, which include mentorship sessions from experienced tech entrepreneurs. The program also has a unique structure that allocates some equity to each of the founders involved, so that they have an incentive to work together. The Fall 2009 San Diego semester has just graduated 12 startups. Mentors for the semester included Trip Adler, CEO, Scribd; Philip Kaplan, Cofounder, Blippy; and Peter Pham, CEO, BillShrink. The new startups include:CloudCanvas: an online image editing suite built in HTML 5 that was previewed in the TechCrunch50 Demo Pit. Live On Campus: an interactive publishing platform for college and university students to share campus information.XBand Technologies: a consumer electronics device for cyclists to do advanced performance, nutrition and hydration motoring. The Institute is currently taking applications for Founders in Paris, Singapore, Los Angeles, and Denver. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Idling in the CrunchGear chatroom the other day, John says to me, that&#8217;s John Biggs, he says, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you interview that guy from Toothpaste for Dinner?&#8221; I says to John &#8220;Why?&#8221; and John says &#8220;He seems like a nice guy.&#8221; Who am I to argue with John? Plus, the guy from Toothpaste for Dinner lives in Columbus, which is where I live, so I sent the guy an email. We had a little back and forth, and he introduced me to his wife, Natalie Dee, so I interviewed her, too. They are, in fact, nice people, and I really enjoyed interviewing them. I hope you enjoy reading my interview.ME: Drew, you appear to be a man of many talents: you have a witty comic, you make music and music videos, you Tweet, make and sell merchandise&#8230; What was the impetus? Where did it all start?DREW: I&#8217;ve been writing for fun as far back as I can remember. I set up my first website in 1996 while in high school, and in college, 1998 or so, I started putting short stories online. Later, I started posting little drawings, and eventually it all came together into Toothpaste For Dinner in 2002.Natalie set her website up in 2002 as well, and we&#8217;ve been able to slowly build traffic ever since then. We&#8217;re hooked up with the biggest screenprinter in Ohio right now, but when we first started selling t-shirts, we had them hand-made by this basement guy out on the east coast. One time he printed a half-case of black shirts on navy blue because it was so dark in the basement he couldn&#8217;t tell they were navy blue. Needless to say, making t-shirts, or merchandise in general, is as much of a trial-and-error process as making an entertainment website.ME: Is Toothpaste for dinner all you, or does Natalie help? What&#8217;s the dividing line on your collaborations?DREW: Toothpaste For dinner is all me, and Natalie Dee is all Natalie. We&#8217;ve both made comics for marriedtothesea.com. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything where we&#8217;re both sitting in front of the same computer like kids doing a group project, but we do bounce ideas off each other.NATALIE: Drew&#8217;s projects are 100% his projects.  My projects are 100% mine. It&#8217;s not so much an &#8220;intentional bifurcation&#8221; as it is two separate people with their own shit going on.  Drew had comics online similar to the Toothpaste ones online before we even met, and likewise, I had been drawing comics and making zines for years before I had any kind of website.  Our respective artistic projects were something we had in common before we started dating, not something we just decided together that we would do.  I think that the Married to the Sea comics I made created a grey area for people, and that one project we both had creative input in confused people over who did what.There is no possessiveness over turf or whatever, because I have no interest in making Drew&#8217;s comics, and I don&#8217;t think he has any interest in doing mine.  There is an exchange of ideas that happens &#8212; if I come up with an idea that I think is funny, but it doesn&#8217;t really fit the tone of my site, I will offer it to Drew, and vice versa.  We help each other with non-comic related work, like Drew doing the programming on my site, but when it comes to making comics or videos or whatever, it&#8217;s one person&#8217;s creative idea, and one person working on it.ME: So &#8230; is this a full-time gig for the both of you, or do you have day jobs?NATALIE: This is our main gig.  Drew has been doing his sites full-time since 2003, and I have been doing mine since 2005.ME: Do you have a self-imposed schedule, or do you just post stuff when you feel like it? If you have a queue of work that is scheduled for publication, how long is it?NATALIE: All of the sites update every day except Superpoop, which updates Monday through Friday.  We keep a pretty decent backlog of comics waiting to go up, usually 4-6 weeks worth.  Sometimes we have more, though, like when we had a kid last year.  I knew I was going to be out of sorts for a bit, so I built up an extra backlog so I was able to take a nice hunk of time off, but my site still updated.  It ended up working out for the best, because I got sick a month or two before my due date and was hospitalized for awhile, then the kid was born prematurely.  Through all that, I didn&#8217;t miss a single update.The tone of our sites might be irreverent, but we take our work deadly seriously because we are professionals.  If people like my stuff enough that I get to do this full-time for a living, then I would be a dumbass to not take it seriously.  My comic updates every day, because that is the expectation.  I don&#8217;t like to involve readers in my personal life, so I don&#8217;t let my personal life interrupt the schedule of my site.  I wouldn&#8217;t be able to not show up a few times a week at a regular job and still expect to get paid, and I don&#8217;t do the same on my site.ME: Do you each act as muse for the other, or are your works mostly self-inspired?NATALIE: I think drew and I both go about making comics in different ways, and most of the inspiration we draw from each other is just when one of us comes up with something that would work a lot better on the other&#8217;s site, or would better match the tone of the other&#8217;s site.  When I think of an idea for a comic that is political or that I think Drew&#8217;s readers would appreciate more, i suggest he take the idea.  Likewise, if he comes up with an idea that would be more illustration-based, or that my readers would appreciate more, then he offers it to me.  If drew started inspiring my comics, i would be worried because my comics are usually inspired by pretty dark thoughts or ideas, and that wouldn&#8217;t bode well for our marriage.DREW: I ask Natalie about a lot of the Tweets I write, because you can&#8217;t really delete them, and if something occurs to you, it&#8217;s really easy to just type it into Twitter and hit the button. There&#8217;s basically nothing that grosses me out so I like to make sure that 13,000 people aren&#8217;t going to simultaneously puke when their phone beeps and they look down and it&#8217;s something sick.ME: Is that the only kind of self-censoring you do? Do you generally keep your audience in mind when you Tweet, or do you mostly just Tweet for your own amusement, and the fact that others enjoy it is a convenient byproduct?DREW: Well, the point of what we do is to communicate with people, so if I think of something that&#8217;s too terrible to write or draw, I won&#8217;t make a comic of it either. It&#8217;s just that Twitter is so immediate that if you type it in as soon as you get the idea, you can hit &#8220;submit&#8221; before you realize that it&#8217;s maybe kind of gross or insensitive. It&#8217;s also pretty easy to post lame jokes on Twitter, as anyone who has used Twitter for any length of time can verify.It&#8217;s easier to throw out comics that don&#8217;t work because we make them weeks ahead of time, and go through the pile every month to pick out which ones to post, and that&#8217;s a good way to reconsider the ones that are too gross, or just not funny.ME: You don&#8217;t (appear to) allow comments on your comics or your blog. How do you engage with your audience? How do you know you&#8217;re on the right track, or do you not care?See, I had this whole line of questions about how you stay witty and up-beat in light of John Gabriel&#8217;s Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory. It&#8217;s something we deal with all the time at CrunchGear: we post something reasonably interesting or informative, and the comments can get overrun by fuckwads. If you&#8217;re not allowing comments, you neatly sidestep that problem. What other hidden benefits are there from not permitting comments? Are there any drawbacks?DREW: I totally appreciate feedback. We publish our email addresses, and people can Twitter at us or post on our Facebook fan pages. Having people leave comments directly on the sites just seems counterproductive. Anyone who wants to write about our work is welcome to embed our comics into their blog and talk about them, or link to them from Twitter/Facebook andpost their opinion, etc. But nobody&#8217;s going to put one of my comics on their own blog and write &#8220;First&#8221; underneath it.The idea behind comments is that you learn what your readers think of your work. A more effective way for us to measure this is to see what people are linking to on Twitter, which images get passed around blogs, what shows up on Digg/Reddit, and so on. I have no doubt that a lot of our readers are funny and write well, but like you mentioned, these people get chased out when the signal-to-noise ratio drops.NATALIE: There&#8217;s never a space under paintings in a gallery where someone writes their opinion. When you get to the end of a book, you don&#8217;t have to see what everyone else thought of it.ME: As communication and networking gets easier and easier online (Facebook, Twitter, blogging, etc), I think your point makes a lot of sense: you don&#8217;t need to provide the mechanism for interaction with people who like your work. They can find one another easy enough now.But that wasn&#8217;t always the case. Twitter and Facebook are relatively new phenomena, and it&#8217;s only in the last couple years that setting up a blog became sufficiently easy for laypeople. To extend on your gallery metaphor, people at the gallery could discuss a piece together, and potentially engage the creator of the work at the gallery. Has the nature of your fanbase changed at all in the last couple years? Did (or do) you want to encourage your fans to interact with one another as much they might interact with yourself?NATALIE: I think my fanbase has remained pretty consistant, obviously there has been immense growth in the number of readers, but the demographics of my readers has remained essentially the same.  I would want to encourage my readers to engage each other MORE than they try in interact with me.  I think they would get more out of interacting with each other, they could discuss what they like and don&#8217;t and bond with each other or whatever people do in fan groups.  Frankly, I prefer to keep my interactions with readers to a minimum, because I think that when writers or artists get too involved in what their fans think about what they&#8217;ve done or what they think they should do, it spoils the project.  It becomes less about the artist expressing themselves, and more about them trying to do backbends to make all their readers happy and make art that is dictated by the reader.  I think an artist should be able to trust their own instincts and realize that sticking to their original vision will work better at attracting more fans.  I mean, that&#8217;s how you got your original fans to begin with, and if your fans were so great at making comics, they would be doing just that instead of trying to be the ghost writer for yours.  I don&#8217;t know ANYTHING about the people who write to me to tell me what they want me to do, so i can&#8217;t put too much credence in what they a demanding I do, and usually their ideas make me cringe.ME: Looking at several other creative properties online, some very much strive to cultivate a community around the works. I guess the fundamental question I&#8217;m asking is: do you create for your own satisfaction, or do you create because you want others to enjoy it?NATALIE: I create what i want to create, and there is no other option for me. I don&#8217;t do spec work unless someone is paying me directly for it.  By staying true to what i want from my comics, my original idea is not diluted by what other people (who, incidentally, don&#8217;t have the insight into what *i* am working towards) want my comic to be.  My comic is what it is, and it attracts people who are happy with it the way it is.  If they want to read a comic by someone who will jump through hoops making comics about in-jokes they have with their comic buds, and put up polls and ask their readers if it is OK every time they need to take a shit, then they can pick from about a million other webcomics.  That is not what is happening on my site, and i think my readers understand that and appreciate my comics as something that isn&#8217;t created by committee.DREW: Nataliedee.com is, the last time I checked, the 5th-most-popular online comic. (Our other comics are less popular, Toothpaste For Dinner is somewhere in the top-20 and the others below that.) We&#8217;re not driving traffic in by hosting forums on the site, so that&#8217;s a pretty good clip, and I think it underscores Natalie&#8217;s point that our work stands on its own.ME: If you weren&#8217;t creating for the web, do you think you&#8217;d still be doing this? That is, when the zombie apocalypse comes and the Interent goes away, will you still be creating stuff? How will you distribute it?NATALIE: We were both creating art and comics and writing before anyone had the internet, so i think it is safe to assume that if there were no internet we would still do artistic projects, only distribute them in the same ways we did prior to having access to the web.  If there was an apocalypse, i hope i would be among the dead, because watching the destruction on civilization and humanity, and then having to either wait to die alone or rebuild civilization myself would be a bummer, and i probably wouldn&#8217;t make comics as i would have no audience.ME: Natalie: you said that if you couldn&#8217;t use the Internet, you&#8217;d still create. Do you think it would still be economically feasible for you to do so as a full-time gig, or would the costs of physical production and distribution change things?NATALIE: I would still make stuff, but if the internet wasn&#8217;t around, I would probably work doing graphics work for a company rather than making my art as my main gig.  I don&#8217;t necessarily think that everyone who makes art is 100% entitled to making a living making art that is completely self-serving like mine is.  I don&#8217;t think that i am entitled to it, which is why I take it seriously and work as hard as I can, so I can take advantage of an opportunity that most people don&#8217;t have.  I like creating stuff, and it is not necessary that I be the one who dictates what I make, I was perfectly happy doing design for other people, when I worked for graphics places and print shops prior to all this.I think that businesses such as mine and Drew&#8217;s are a unique beast that exists on the internet alone.  The comics are what we do, but we give those to our readers for free.  We would never be able to have the reach, or be able to give our work to anyone who was interested in viewing it if the situation was different.  By working on the internet, we can cast the net wide in terms of the people we bring in, because of the medium as well as us offering entertainment for free. We bring in so many people, and then a small percentage purchase merchandise, which is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute in comparison to distributing daily content for free by traditional means.  Perhaps I wasn&#8217;t totally clear when you asked before if I still would make stuff if there wasn&#8217;t an internet&#8211;  of course I would, that&#8217;s what I do, but I don&#8217;t get my satisfaction from people looking at what I&#8217;ve made, I get my satisfaction from making what I want.  So, yes, I would make stuff, but it is hard to say if anyone would see what I made, because when you are forced to distribute through traditional means you have to make a lot of concessions so none of your channels of distribution are interrupted due to conflicts of interest.  I am more interested in making what I want, and potentially having nobody see it, than I am in capitulating for some publishing house or syndicate and making a name for myself making something that is cack.ME: The Internet makes all markets local, in many senses. Specifically, it allows people to self-select what content they consume, which is great for unique content like yours. If you had to distribute without the Internet, how might that affect your audience? I&#8217;m thinking of other unique content, like xkcd.com, for example: the audience that appreciates that kind of humor is way too specific to allow xkcd to get distribution in most print publications (or at least newspapers). But the Internet makes it trivially easy for xkcd to reach people who appreciate it. I imagine the Internet has the same advantages for you. Would you change your work at all, or would you be willing to live with a smaller audience if the Internet went away tomorrow?NATALIE: I think our sites are anything BUT local, and I believe the main benefit of the internet is that you can go from zero to global immediately.  We get traffic from every country with internet access, and have shipped merchandise to every country with mail delivery.  On the internet, you have a chance to showcase your work to absolutely everyone, all at once.  In more traditional distribution models, you have to work from a local level, to a regional level, to a national level, and beyond. Every level is punctuated by some distribution point that doesn&#8217;t particularly care about what you are doing.  On the internet, you can offer your unadulterated vision to everybody everywhere, without the input of people who are only concerned about numbers and cutting you out of your hard-earned profits.  So, where someone using traditional means can reach 30 million people, they might only be making 1/4 of what i make with only a million readers, because everybody has their fingers stuck in traditional media&#8217;s pie. I am the only one who makes any money off my work, aside from the people we employ to manufacture goods and fulfill orders.  I am not paying anyone 90% of my money to tell me I can&#8217;t do what I want.The reason for my comics has never been to cater to a specific audience.  I make comics every day with hundreds of thousands of readers and I made my comics every day when I had a thousand readers. I don&#8217;t pander to my audience, because it makes me hate my job, and I think it insults the intelligence of my readers, so, no, I wouldn&#8217;t change my comic to attract readers or have a larger audience.  If i was unable to publish online, I would probably not pursue traditional publishing.  All this talk of internet vs. other print options always sounds like an inferiority complex on the part of internet folks. Traditional media is shaking in its boots thinking about what we can do online that they could never compete with.  The internet has dealt damaging blows to newspapers, book publishers, news outlets, retail establishments, and has changed the way we do almost everything.  Ithink that talking about the internet disappearing is about as fanciful as talking about what would happen if there were no radios, if not more so since the internet has changed things more than the radio or any other tech development ever has.  We&#8217;re not going back. If some hell-pony galloped to Server Beach and laid waste to the entire internet, then oh well, I guess.  I would still make art, but I would probably not make it as widely available because I hate dealing with people, and talking to them.ME: What one thing do you wish people could better understand about your work or your process? For example, I&#8217;d like CrunchGear readers to know that I don&#8217;t always get to pick the stories about which I write. Most of them are assigned to me. Most readers don&#8217;t understand our process, so they feel no compunction against calling me an idiot or a poor journalist when I&#8217;m writing about something I&#8217;ve only just learned about. Of course, I&#8217;m sure some of them would continue to insult me even if they did know this. :( What are the frustrating aspects of your work?NATALIE: I wish people more people would notice how much work i actually put into my comics.  The overall style is childlike, but a lot of the comics are very detailed and take me a long time.  I recently drew a nesting doll that took 2 or 3 days of sketching and planning and drawing. A lot of time, when people talk about my stuff, they are like OH SHE IS SO RANDOM WITH HER MS PAINT DRAWINGS, but nothing on my site is random, nothing is made on MS paint, and a lot of it took a lot of work. It is kind of insulting to work as hard as we do, then have people imply that it is just word salad because they don&#8217;t get what&#8217;s going on. It can be appreciated on the superficial layer, but also has more to it.  If you think about what i present, you will see that most of my site is not about hotdogs or whatever, and is really just me holding a mirror up to society, and showing how disappointing it really is.  That&#8217;s where my comics come from a lot of the time, and i think people&#8217;s expectations of what a comic is supposed to be stops them from reading more into what i&#8217;m doing.Aside from that, i just wish people would be able to appreciate my work, and drew&#8217;s work on it&#8217;s own merit, instead of having to frame everything in our personal relationship.  When drew has a new album, i don&#8217;t think people should want to interview me, because i had nothing to do with it.  Likewise, i don&#8217;t think drew has any more insight into my thought processes as any of my other readers, because i make my comics and write alone, without his input.  I realize it is a point of interest for people, but the way our sites are linked up, and our stores are linked up, is just a convenience thing since we file taxes together, not a  suggestion that none of the sites stand alone on their own strengths.DREW: Neither of us are programmers in any capacity. I can poke my way around a PHP file, but that&#8217;s about it. We have a part-time developer who codes new features for the site and fixes things when they break, but we don&#8217;t have the budget or time to jump into every new format of delivering comics. I appreciate the sentiment, which at its heart is just people wanting to look at our comics (albeit in a very specific way) but it&#8217;s impossible for us to code new platform-specific applications every few months. Thankfully, almost every new computer or phone coming out now has a web browser, which means that if people can read any other website, they can continue to read ours.ME: What do you do to relax?DREW: I like to cook, hang out with my daughter, make music&#8230; pretty regular stuff. I do not relax by doing yardwork. My neighborhood is all about yardwork. I&#8217;m allergic to everything so yardwork is always me out in the yard, covered in poison-oak welts, wearing a dust-mask and trying to breathe. There&#8217;s actually a picture of this exact thing somewhere. I won&#8217;t include it out of self-respect.NATALIE: Hahaha i work. I spend most of my time taking care of the kid, so my comic-making time is the most pure, uninterrupted chill-out time i get.ME: What are your favorite online diversions? What websites do you frequent?NATALIE: I just read jezebel, and talk to my friends on facebook.  I am not really the cutting-edge of web-surfing.DREW: I mostly just read the news and flip thru image aggregators / synthesizer websites. Nothing too unusual.

It wasn&#8217;t about defending the rights of women to browse the app store unflustered. It was about image. Here&#8217;s Gruber&#8217;s cogent and true argument: I think what Apple was getting squeamish about wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the sexy apps themselves, but the cheesiness that the sexy apps (and their prominence in best selling lists) was bestowing upon the general feel and vibe of the App Store. One thing I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t aware of before the recent crackdown was the degree to which these apps were seeping into various non-entertainment categories. E.g., like half the â\\x80\\x9cnewâ\\x80\\x9d apps in the â\\x80\\x9cproductivityâ\\x80\\x9d category featured imagery of large-breasted bikini-clad women.These apps were shut down temporarily. They will be back, and the ban wasn&#8217;t about not offending our sainted mothers. It was about making a retail experience that people want to visit and, like Chef Ramsay shutting down Casa Roma rather than serve the rest of the night&#8217;s meals in a haphazard, sloppy way, Apple decided to shut things down and make their decisions. This, in turn, forces Apple management to make a decision.Think about it: sex sells and what percolates to the top of the App Store? Sex. When you buy an iPhone and open the App Store, you don&#8217;t see quality content for quality people. You see &#8220;Boob Dancer&#8221; and &#8220;Sassy Bikini Girl 2.0.&#8221; If this is your first experience with the App Store, you&#8217;re going to be put off. Quality, or at lease perceived quality, goes down.I think the boob apps will return under a new category that will be almost completely inaccessible until unlocked by a sentient adult. This, in turn, will reduce the number of boob apps visible to the average user.Think about your own App Store experience. I&#8217;m fairly sure you didn&#8217;t buy &#8220;Bikini Personal Information Manager 1.0&#8243; when you first bought your iPhone. You probably bought iShoot or downloaded Yelp or rocked out with some Tap Tap Revolution. I think the vast majority of users follow this same path. The boob apps are for the febrile mind and downloaded more for yuks than out of actual interest.In the end, those poor, sad-faced app designers will get a new category and they&#8217;ll be able to sell their garbage again. Heck, some dumb app called Wobble which essentially lets you make people&#8217;s boobs wobble is back in the App Store. This is Apple&#8217;s world. We just live in it.',\n",

The news comes roughly 7 weeks after Baidu confirmed plans to established a new independent company to provide licensed, advertising-supported online video content to Chinese Internet users.Although it isn&#8217;t yet explicitly confirming that the name of the new company will be Qiyi in the press release about the investment, Baidu says it has registered the domain name qiyi.com for the venture.Reuters broke the news about a possible forthcoming investment by Providence Equity Partners in the new venture on January 5, citing local news sources who reported that the new joint venture company had received about $60 million in private equity funds, with Baidu investing about $10 million into the firm.If those reports were accurate, that means Qiyi only has Baidu and Providence as its backers for now. Baidu has also said that it will continue to maintain majority ownership in Qiyi.According to eMarketer, China will have 518 million Internet users in 2010. The size of the country&#8217;s online video market was approximately 162 million yuan ($23.73 million) in Q3 2009, according to data from research firm Analysys International, and analysts expect sales to triple in the coming years.Update: more context on the space is available here (via comments).Baidu stresses that it will work with regulators to ensure the &#8220;lawful distribution&#8221; of professionally produced media and entertainment content on the Internet.From the About page:Qiyi (www.qiyi.com) is an independent operated video website created by the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest Chinese search engine Baidu Inc(BIDU.O).

       "  'comments_content': 'Super-angel Ron Conway, who is one of the most prolific and successful investors in Silicon Valley, is expanding his SV Angel fund to include outside investors (recently he has invested only his own capital in startups). He is raising a new fund of around $10 million, we&#8217;ve confirmed.Conway, who was called the &#8220;Godfather of Silicon Valley&#8221; in a book by Gary Rivlin, is considered by many to be the most important angel investor in technology. He sees most new startups before anyone else, and an investment by his firm is a serious milestone. His deep ties to most top tier venture capital firms also ensure quick introductions and a long look when the time comes to raise a second and larger round of capital.He was one of the first investors in Google, and has, he says, invested in hundreds of startups over the last twenty years. His current investments include Facebook, Twitter, Digg and just about every other startup of note you&#8217;ve heard about.In other words, he isn&#8217;t going to have any trouble finding takers for this $10 million fund.Until mid-2009 Conway made most of his investments through Baseline Ventures, a fund run by Steve Anderson. Conway moved to direct investing as he began to focus his time on real-time startups, which he is still bullish on. In June 2009, he promised 40-50 new investments over the following 18 months. Since that time, he&#8217;s averaged about 4 investments per month, so he&#8217;s well on track to keep that promise.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'FriendFeed is down right now. It has been down for the past 30 minutes or so. Sadly, that&#8217;s not news anymore. Not because, like Twitter of old, it&#8217;s down all the time, but rather, because it seems like no one really uses it anymore. Case in point, it&#8217;s been down for over 30 minutes and there are maybe 50 total tweets about it (and several are from the same users).That means that of all the tens of millions of people around the world on Twitter, a full 50 of them care enough to tweet when FriendFeed is down. It&#8217;s hard to imagine any other service that got to the size FriendFeed did (which, granted, wasn&#8217;t huge), only getting 50 tweets if it goes down.It&#8217;s sad, really. FriendFeed was easily one of my favorite services (so much so that I&#8217;m still waiting for another service to replace it). But since the acquisition by Facebook, it has been a ghost town. And now, with its 500 Internal Server Error, it&#8217;s really a ghost town. The impressive team behind FriendFeed (most are still with Facebook now) have indicated they wouldn&#8217;t let the service wither, but that seems to be exactly what is happening.If it comes back up, I wonder how many of these remaining few dozen passionate FriendFeed users that are tweeting will even notice. Maybe they&#8217;ll just give up too.Update: FriendFeed is still down over an hour later. Their official Twitter account blames a &#8220;major power outage.&#8221;CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;re two weeks away from the SXSW Interactive, a drinking festival with a side of tech that takes place each year in Austin, Texas (before the larger SXSW film and music portions). While the conference itself is interesting, more interesting is usually the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; that comes out of it. And I think I already know what it will be this year.Three years ago, Twitter famously was the talk of the conference (it won the web award that year). While sure, it didn&#8217;t explode into mainstream popularity until sometime later, the writing was on the wall for the early-adopters who started using it there or shortly thereafter. Two years ago, it was arguably Twitter again that was the must-use service throughout the conference as it continued to mature. But last year saw some new entries rise. Both Foursquare and Gowalla launched at the conference, with Foursquare gaining much of the momentum coming out of the conference (as some of us predicted). And this year, I suspect it will be largely an extension of that, with location services in general being the talk of the show.Based on what I&#8217;ve been hearing, basically at the major players in the location-based space have big things planned for this year&#8217;s SXSW. Foursquare hopes to have a new, completely overhauled version of its iPhone app ready for the event this year. They are also likely to have a huge batch of new badges for people to collect throughout the week. Meanwhile, Gowalla has a large event of its own, complete with special VIP access if you use the service throughout the conference. The SXSW conference is also highlighting the Austin-based Gowalla as a key tool on its own pages.A newer startup, Plancast (started by TechCrunch alum Mark Hendrickson â\\x80\\x94 think &#8220;Foursquare For The Future&#8220;), has already put together a helpful unofficial SXSW guide surrounding events during the conference (and actually events for those who aren&#8217;t attending too). They also hope to have their iPhone app ready in time for the conference.Meanwhile, both Twitter&#8217;s andÂ\\xa0SimpleGeo&#8217;s plans are still largely unknown at this point, but both are planning big things, we hear. Twitter could use the event to launch its ad platform, and CEO Evan Williams is giving the keynote on Monday.And then, of course, there is Facebook. While they&#8217;re sniffing around Loopt right now, could they use the conference to talk a bit more about their location plans? If all these other services start getting a ton of buzz during the conference, they might have to.Of course, all of this is assuming that AT&amp;T supplies any service whatsoever this year. Last year, the network was completely overloaded until the final two days after the telecom giant scrambled to up their bandwidth (and even then it was only marginally better). They promised that failure would never happen again (people in San Francisco in New York City may have something to say about that), so we&#8217;ll see this year. If AT&amp;T fails again, it could really hurt a lot of these location-based services, many of which are heavily predicated around the iPhone.Otherwise, this is going to be location&#8217;s year at SXSW.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': \"A month ago, Jason Calacanis went on a rant about why everyone should boycott comScore. He felt they were using sketchy tactics to bully people into their pay-to-play model for measuring web analytics. He also noted that their free competitors like Quantcast, Google, and Compete would soon eat their lunch. Both Quantcast and Google (Analytics) offer direct counting of pageviews (but even these methods can be abused). But you may wonder how exactly Compete gets its numbers? It appears, that some sketchy tactics are (or at least were) employed, as well.We were recently pointed to this post from last month by Ben Edelman, a Harvard privacy advocate. In it, he details the data the Upromise toolbar collects and sends out. This toolbar is used by college students looking for savings on various items across the web, and can be quite useful. But until a few weeks ago, it appears they were also sending web browsing (and more personal) data to Compete without anyone&#8217;s knowledge. Writes Edelman:As shown in the &#8220;host:&#8221; header of each of the preceding communications, transmissions flow to the consumerinput.com domain. Whois reports that this domain is registered to Boston, MA traffic-monitoring service Compete, Inc. Compete&#8217;s siteÂ\\xa0promises clients access to &#8220;detailed behavioral data,&#8221; and CompeteÂ\\xa0says more than 2 million U.S. Internet users &#8220;have given [Compete] permission to analyze the web pages they visit.&#8221;He continues:Upromise&#8217;s installation sequence does not obtain users&#8217; permission for this detailed and intrusive tracking. Quite the contrary: Numerous Upromise screens discuss privacy, and they all fail to mention the detailed information Upromise actually transmits.The UpromiseÂ\\xa0toolbar installation page touts the toolbar&#8217;s purported benefits at length, but mentions no privacy implications whatsoever.If a user clicks the prominent button to begin the toolbar installation, theÂ\\xa0next screen presents a 1,354-word license agreement that fills 22 on-screen pages and offers no mechanism to enlarge, maximize, print, save, or search the lengthy text. But even if a user did read the license, the user would receive no notice of detailed tracking. Meanwhile, the lower on-screen box describes a &#8220;Personalized Offers&#8221; feature, which is labeled as causing &#8220;information about [a user's] online activity [to be] collected and used to provide college savings opportunities&#8221; But that screen nowhere admits collecting users&#8217; email addresses or credit card numbers. Nor would a user rightly expect that &#8220;information about &#8230; online activity&#8221; means a full log of every search and every page-view across the entire web.Shortly after Edelman&#8217;s post (and a follow-up PCMag.com post), Upromise changed their privacy policy to alert their users that this data is being sent out. But the company declined to state how long the issue had been going on.Privacy implications aside, it&#8217;s interesting that this is one of the ways Compete was gathering data. And it would be good to know where else they get it from. On their site, they only vaguely note that they have &#8220;developed a unique methodology created by experts in the fields of mathematics, statistics and the data sciences to aggregate, transform, enhance and normalize data in order to estimate U.S. Internet traffic.&#8221; They also claim to have over two million members â\\x80\\x94 but apparently, at least some of them (such as the Upromise toolbar users), don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re members.I&#8217;ve sent a message to Compete asking them what other means (other toolbars, etc) they use to gather their data. In light of this Upromise fiasco, it seems wise that they should disclose that kind of information. I&#8217;ll update if and when I hear back.CrunchBase Information\",\n",

It is just in a limited test.  But it does suggest that Google is starting to seriously think about ways to drive more sharing of content across the Web.  But why push content to Facebook and not to Twitter?  And for that matter where is the Google Buzz button?Of course, sharing to Google Reader is the same as sharing to Buzz (that&#8217;s how sharing works on Buzz), but Google should push the Buzz brand here if this feature ever becomes widespread.  Google Reader itself has long had many sharing options, including the ability to send posts to Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Delicious, Blogger, and StumbleUpon.  It&#8217;s about time Google News got better sharing options as well.  Currently, the only sharing option is via email.

Here are two we&#8217;ve received in the last week. Which we&#8217;re posting in honor of Yahoo breaking its own embargo, and the AP sending the launch of CODE advisors completely sideways by breaking an embargo by nearly 24 hours. Outcast PR was on both stories.First, the job description. Even a decade ago everyone thought PR was just about the worst job around. Forbes did a roundup called &#8220;Five Crappiest Tech Jobs,&#8221; and &#8220;PR account executive for a dot com startup&#8221; was on the list. Other winners included &#8220;porn sifter for filtering company&#8221; and &#8220;packer for dogdoo.com&#8221; (a site that actually sold dog excrement online):PR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE FOR A DOT-COM STARTUPâ\\x80\\x94Here&#8217;s the perfect job for people who want the worst of all worlds. For starters, everyone hates flacks. Journalists hate them because they think they&#8217;re incompetent whores. Businesspeople hate them because they think they&#8217;re incompetent whores. And flacks hate themselves because deep down inside they suspect that they might be incompetent whores. But what&#8217;s particularly bad about doing publicity for Internet startups is that everyone in the media has already heard every story with every angle about every product and every service a thousand times and never wants to hear from another PR firm as long as they live. But flacks can&#8217;t explain this problem to their nitwit 23-year-old CEO clients because the CEOs have all persuaded themselves that their generic success story is the stuff of legend. Flacks get personally abused by clients, insulted by journalists, stiffed out of their fees by customers, ridiculed by colleagues, and humiliated by their superiors. One flack for a major software company says her boss got so upset that he ordered her to attend charm school. Another had to go shopping for underwear for a skivvy-less journalist. How uncouth. All in all, being a dot-com flack is exactly like being a whore, except the hours are worse.

I get a lot of email.PR Pro: Shall I send it again?Blogger: No. What did it say?PR Pro: Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to tell you, but youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to agree to the embargo first.Blogger: Ok whatever, I agree, now tell me more.PR Pro: Can you email back first saying you agree to the embargo?Blogger: I get a lot of email.PR Pro: Please.Blogger: Look, I honor the fucking embargo.  Now tell me more.PR Pro: A Silicon Valley based startup is going to announce a new revolutionary software as a service for social media companies targeting B2B.  It will change the way social media marketing is done forever.  Are you interested in a briefing with the companyâ\\x80\\x99s CEO.Blogger: No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t cover B2B.PR Pro: But I thought you wrote about social media.Blogger: I do, but not B2B.PR Pro: But it is revolutionary.Blogger: So are all the others.PR Pro: Really?Blogger: Yes.  Look, when every new social media service is revolutionary it is no longer news.PR Pro: I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that, but we are working on an API.Blogger: Iâ\\x80\\x99m not interested.PR Pro: Oh.Blogger: Sorry.PR Pro: Can I still email you the details?Blogger: If you must. PR Pro: And youâ\\x80\\x99ll honor the embargo?Blogger: Yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll honor the embargo.  In fact Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make you a better offer. PR Pro: Oh.Blogger: I will honor the embargo for the rest of my working life.  As I have no intention of writing about your new revolutionary software as a service for social media companies that will change the way social media marketing is done forever.  So, yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll honor the fucking embargo.PR Pro: I canâ\\x80\\x99t thank you enough.Blogger: Itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing.

       "  'comments_content': 'Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman is an occasional contributor to TechCrunch. And when he does take the time to write a guest column, they are certainly worth reading. In this post he laments cheapskate founders who trickle tiny amounts of equity down to early employees, and presumably he&#8217;s taken his own advice with the now-profitable Redfin. See his earlier posts Entrepreneur 2.0 and Good Question! The Eight Best Questions We Got While Raising Venture Capital.When we split the atom, Einstein remarked that everything changed but our way of thinking. You could make the same argument about acquisitions and option pools.As Mark Suster recently noted, employees will never see a big payday at most startups unless the company shoots for the moon. This is probably why investorsâ\\x80\\x99 case for a company to sell early focuses exclusively on the founder: in most early-stage acquisitions, the liquidation preferences and deal-sweeteners only work for investors and founders. Back when some companies sold at $50 million and others went public at $250 million, we could all agree that this was just how the cookie crumbled. But now that we live in a world where early-stage acquisitions are the only outcome to which most startups aspire, we have to re-allocate this smaller cookie.  The elephant in the room is that that founders and CEOs take almost all of it for themselves. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve looked at three or four deals recently as an adviser; in every case, the founder or CEO was taking more than half the company for himself, and leaving 10% for everyone else. Why arenâ\\x80\\x99t we surprised when three months later that company canâ\\x80\\x99t hire enough engineers?Even when the company succeeds, the big-shot with the big payday may regret it. The difference between $10 million and $20 million in practical terms &#8212; whom you can date, where you can go, what you drive &#8212; is zero. But if you give an extra $10 million to the folks who fought shoulder to shoulder with you, everyone will feel better about what you accomplished together. You want your startup to end like Trading Places, with Eddie Murphy,  Dan Aykroyd and their butler sipping drinks on the beach.This has always been true, but now that more startups are being bought, it has become less common. Consider the proceeds of a $50-million acquisition for a 100-person company that has raised $14 million with a typical liquidation preference:Because of the liquidation preference, the investors get $14 million right off the top. The remaining $36 million is divided according to equity ownership.Investors own 50%, and get $18 million, split between two firmsThe two founders own 33%, and split $12 millionThe 3-person executive team, including a CEO if one was hired, owns 10%, and splits $3.6 million. The team gets another $3 million as a severance payment or an earn-out, to sweeten the acquisition offer.The remaining 95 employees split 7%, each earning $27,000. Unlike the founders, the employees have to wait until their grants vest, working at a company no longer of their choosing for two years.Now consider what would happen if the same company raises another $10 million, expands the employee option pool to hire more executives and to support 300 people. It is worth $250 million at the time of a public offering.There is no liquidation preference, severance payment or earn out. Everyone is paid according to the number of shares he owns.Investors by now own 60%, or $167 million, split between three firmsThe two founders own 20%, and split $50 millionThe executive team still gets 10%, but now splits it among 5 people. Each executive gets $5 million.The remaining 290 employees own 10%, with the first 100 employees hired getting the lion&#8217;s share, of say $200,000 each.The point is not that this is a better outcome for all. Any fool would take the higher price if he knew he could get it, but you donâ\\x80\\x99t know when or whether you ever will. The point is that employees at least stand a chance at a nice gain when a company is built to last, whereas founders benefit disproportionately from a quick flip.So in a world of more quick flips, we need to increase the size of options pools, eliminate liquidation preferences â\\x80\\x93 which just get picked up in subsequent rounds of financing by new investors, who screw the old ones &#8212; and provide better acceleration for everyone.Otherwise, nobody will want to work for a startup. But the reverse is happening. VCs want their pound of flesh, and entrepreneurs do too. In fact, the 20% of company ownership that was once considered the standard allocation for executives and other employees is now more likely to be at 10%.If weâ\\x80\\x99re all a little less greedy now, weâ\\x80\\x99ll build bigger companies later and everyone will make more money, and feel better about it too.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'There are plenty of collaborative document editors out there, but when it comes to getting input about a new document or PowerPoint deck, many businesses still rely on the tried-and-true method of printing them out, handing them around the office, and asking people to scribble their notes directly onto their printed copies. If that situation sounds familiar, you&#8217;ll probably want to check out Crocodoc, a Y Combinator-funded startup that&#8217;s launching today.  Crocodoc makes it easy to share and mark up virtual documents the same way you would on a piece of paper, and it only takes a few seconds to start using it.Crocodoc is an extremely straightforward service, and you don&#8217;t even need to sign up for an account to use it â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0just upload a document, and a second later you&#8217;ll be in the Crocodoc editor. Markup tools include Sticky Notes, a highligher, text strikeout, and the ability to leave your own comments (a &#8216;pen&#8217; tool is on the way).  Editing a document should be very familiar to anyone who has used Adobe Acrobat or Apple&#8217;s Preview. If you&#8217;d like to try marking up a sample document, you can use this demo.By default, the service assigns each uploaded a document a unique, &#8220;unguessable&#8221; URL, which you can use to share the document with friends, who can mark it up and add their own comments. But there&#8217;s one catch to the free version of the service: if you lose the document URL, that marked up document is lost for good (remember, you didn&#8217;t create an account to sign up).Fortunately Crocodoc also offers a &#8216;Pro&#8217; version, which lets you create an account that includes an archive of your previously uploaded documents.  It also allows you to password protect your uploaded docs (as opposed to just relying on the hard-to-guess URL for security), and to use SSL encryption. Pro Accounts cost $8/month or $36/year. And for companies that are wary of uploading sensitive files, Crocodoc offers intranet deployments, which means that these customers can run it inside their firewalls on their own servers.My only gripe about Crocodoc is the limited number of collaboration options Â\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you can share your documents with as many people as you want, but everyone will be editing the same one, which seems like it would get messy fast. This will be fixed in the near future, when Crocodoc starts allowing you to review edits on a per-user basis.Crocodoc&#8217;s still quite basic, but that might be exactly what its customers are looking for. Â\\xa0And they may well be willing to spend $36 a year if it means they&#8217;ll have to print out fewer stacks of paper.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Fundamentally, what I liked about FriendFeed was that it gave me a way to take all kinds of social data and create a tailored way to view it. And though the idea never took off in the mainstream before their acquisition by Facebook, the desire for a service that can do this, remains. Despite their efforts, Facebook hasn&#8217;t solved this yet. And despite all the hype, neither has the new Google Buzz. There are at least a dozen other startups working on this problem too, but no one has even come close to FriendFeed yet. But a new one, still in stealth, offers hope.Knowmore, is a New York City-based startup founded by Julian Gutman (ex-Google) and Joseph West (ex-Akamai). They&#8217;ve already assembled a team that includes Jeremie Miller, the inventor of XMPP/Jabber, Wilson Bilkovich one of the core developers of Rubinius (a Ruby implementation), and Wes Augur, a former principal R&amp;D engineer at Digg. It&#8217;s a wide range of talent across a bunch of different fields. The total team is already up to 20 people, according to their jobs page.Talent aside, what sounds interesting about Knowmore is their approach to the social noise problem. Rather than focusing on complex technologies that only seems to make social data more complicated (&#8220;why is this being shown,&#8221; etc&#8230;), Knowmore is building its product around user experience and human-centric design. The person who helped steer the early design of the product itself was Chad Pugh, the visual designer of Vimeo (though he&#8217;s not full time with the team).As you can see on their splash page, Knowmore&#8217;s slogan is the &#8220;dashboard for the social web.&#8221; As you might expect, the idea is to port in your data from a variety of social networks, and let Knowmore serve it up to you in a way that cuts through the noise. As Mike wrote earlier this month, &#8220;social today feels like search a decade ago: lots of noise and lots of spam.&#8221; That&#8217;s exactly the problem Knowmore is going after.They believe Facebook and Twitter cannot tackle these problems because they are communication pipes at their core. Knowmore is aiming to be a consumption platform instead.So will it work? That&#8217;s impossible to know without seeing the product in action (the tentative launch date is Q2 2010). But the pedigree of the talent behind this startup and a simple execution of the core idea certainly makes it one worth watching.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'At recent the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, mobile app analytics startup Distimo gave a presentation with some other interesting comparisons, such the relative size of the iPhone App Store (150,000 total apps at the time) compared to the Android Market (20,000) and Blackberry (5,000) others.  It showed that in January alone, the Apple App store grew by 13,865 apps versus 3,005 new Android apps, 734 new Nokia Ovia apps, and 501 new Blackberry apps. Android was the fastest growing App store and the Android market has more free apps (57 percent) than Apple (25%) or any other mobile app store (full slide deck embedded below).By far the most popular category in the iPhone app store is games. Distimo reported that 58 percent of all apps in the App Store are games.  And in a new report that just came out today (download it here), Distimo breaks down the game apps further by price, category, and which ones sell the most.  While the biggest category is Puzzles (15 percent), Action and Arcade both come in second with 11 percent each.  The average price of a paid game in Apple&#8217;s App Store is $2.24, much cheaper than Blackberry games ($4.60) or Windows Mobile games ($4.90), and a little bit above Android games (2.08).Breaking down further by category in the Apple App store, the most expensive games are in the Role Playing category, with an average price of $7.96.  Action and Arcade games are cheaper with average prices of $1.68 and $1.39 respectively. Adventure games are in the middle with an average price of $4.43.  But when you look the top grossing games, 22 percent are in the Action category, 12 percent are in Arcade, and 9 percent are Adventure. Those are the top three grossing categories.  Only 5 percent of the top grossing games are role playing games.  (Click on charts at right to enlarge).So the top-grossing games are not necessarily the ones with the highest price points, especially as game developers switch to free or 99-cent games with in-app purchases.  According to Distimo, Tap Tap Revenge 3, which became free and upsells songs via in-app purchases grossed more in January than the FIFA 2010 soccer game, which sells for $6.99.  Quality games can still command higher prices, but getting players to pay more over time seems to be the strategy many top mobile game developers are pursuing.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'As we reported last night, Yammer has just announced that it will begin allowing users to sign up for the microblogging service without requiring email addresses that are associated with their company domain names (e.g. jason@company.com).  This new feature, called Communities, will open the service to less formal organizations, and even families.  And it also opens the door to B2B collaboration, which is how Yammer seems to be primarily marketing the new feature Â\\xa0Communities will launch on March 1.This is a big move for the company.  On a conference call this morning, Yammer CEO David Sacks said that one of the problems with Yammer so far has been that communication on the service has been restricted to internal use within a company.  The issue many people ran into was that they&#8217;d want to collaborate with their clients or business partners as well, but didn&#8217;t have a way to do that without inviting them to their company&#8217;s internal network (which often wasn&#8217;t an option).Now they&#8217;ll be able to build networks around each of their partnerships, upcoming events, and clients, while still keeping their internal networks private.  Communities appear to function a lot like Yammer&#8217;s existing Groups, but now they can include people who aren&#8217;t in your company network. The site now features a &#8216;Communities&#8217; tab at the top of the screen, which allows users to jump between a number of linked networks. There&#8217;s also a new tab called &#8216;Networks&#8217; that allows you to see how many unread messages are available in each of the networks you&#8217;re linked to. Communities will include the same administration tools as company networks (and will offer more control than Groups do).Yammer Communities will follow Yammer&#8217;s pricing model â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it&#8217;s free to use, with premium pricing for more advanced features.  Sacks says that the company&#8217;s iPhone application will support Communities from day one, as will the AIR-based Yammer desktop client.We&#8217;ve been using Yammer internally at TechCrunch since it launched (and won) TechCrunch50 2008, and have found it to be a great way to coordinate our team.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Trackur, a bootstrapped startup founded by Internet marketing consultant and writer Andy Beal, up until now offered only paid versions of its online reputation management and social media monitoring tools, albeit with free trial periods.Today, the fledgling company is introducing an entirely gratis version of the Web-based software suite, giving marketers and small business owners a compelling reason to want to check it out and see why basic Google Alerts simply may not be cutting it anymore.When you enter a keyword in Trackur&#8217;s search system, the service will look for mentions in both &#8216;mainstream&#8217; and social media, tweets, videos, images, tags and so on. You&#8217;ll get a nice overview of where that keyword &#8211; which would generally be a company, brand or product name &#8211; has been mentioned along with some graphs tracking such mentions over time. You can save a search, which means Trackur will run it automatically every 30 minutes and notify you of new mentions across all of the media it tracks.With any of the paid versions of Trackur, you can save multiple search keywords to your personal dashboard, but the free version will only allow you to do that for one. For a lot of small business owners or marketers, that will actually be sufficient, although the startup evidently hopes they&#8217;ll be tempted to pay for an upgrade at some point.Alternatives to Trackur are plenty and include services offered by companies like Radian6, Visible Technologies and Attentio.Trackur is self-funded by Beal, who says he currently serves about 15,000+ users, a mixture of people benefiting from free trials and those who are effectively paying for the product. Beal declined to break down those numbers, but says his 3-person startup, which was founded early 2008, has been operating profitably since day one. He also told me he&#8217;s been approached by venture capitalists in the past who&#8217;ve offered to invest, but that he told most of them that he wouldn&#8217;t even know what to do with $100,000 if it were given to him.God, I love bootstrapped ventures.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Twitter is becoming a serious marketing vehicle for local businesses.  Everyone from your local baker to your favorite restaurant is getting on Twitter to talk to customers and draw in new ones.  Just last weekend when I was driving to Vermont with my family, I sent out a Tweet asking for a good place to eat lunch.  I got more than five responses, including one from a local innkeeper couple recommending two spots in town (not owned by them).  That was in Brattleboro, Vermont.But that was so random.  How do you even find out which of your favorite local businesses have Twitter accounts or what their Twitter handles are?  Well, CitySearch is doing it for you.  The local business guide is starting to build out a definitive directory of Twitter accounts and Tweets about local restaurants, hotels, spas and stores.  It is starting small, with about 5,000 business listings currently tied to their Twitter accounts (which businesses can add themselves when they claim their CitySearch page), but its aim is to add Tweets by and about any of the 15 million businesses in its listings.Every page on CitySerach now prominently highlights a Twitter Buzz widget on the upper right hand corner of the page showing recent Tweets about businesses in your city.  If the business has a known Twitter handle, recent Tweets with their @handle (their Twitter name) will show up above the user reviews.  These include both Tweets from the business and Tweets that mention the business.  For instance, apparently people love @artichokepizza and the &#8220;calzones are off the chain too!&#8221;  Chelsea Piers also gets a lot of Tweets.&#8220;It really lowers the threshold for reviews,&#8221; CitySearch senior VP Kara Nortman tells me.  It also makes the reviews more immediate, and therefore relevant.  I&#8217;d much rather know how a chef&#8217;s Mahi-Mahi is going over with diners today than last week when a different chef might have ben on duty.  Since it started rolling out the local Tweets a couple of weeks ago, engagement metrics are noticeably higher across the site: session durations are up 10 percent, pageviews per visit are up 7 percent, and exit rates are down about 3 percent.In addition to being able to look up businesses by name, CitySearch has Twitter directories of local businesses by city.  So far there are only 820 in New York City and 281 in San Francisco , but CitySearch is just getting going.  Any business with a Twitter account can add their account to their CitySearch page.  In fact, they can sign up for a Twitter account while they are at it right from within CitySearch and use CitySearch as a Twitter client.  Also, right now CitySearch is only showing Tweets that explicitly mention the @handle a business uses on Twitter.  Over the next few weeks, CitySearch will start to surface Tweets that mention the business whether or not the @handle is used. So those 5,000 listings should expand quickly.Nortman says that the Twitter business directory was inspired by CrunchBase, our own directory of startups, people, and venture capital firms.  She wants it to become the definitive directory of Twitter business accounts.  CitySearch is in a unique position to build this because it already has millions of local businesses in its database.  All it needs to do is associate Twitter accounts and related Tweets to each business, and it can slice and dice them by city, neighborhood, or type of business.  An update of its iPhone app which is making its way through the App Store approval process right now will double as a Twitter client and let you Tweet out your reviews from the app.  It will even have a social tab showing all the Tweets about a business (see leaked screenshot at right).  Sentiment analysis is also on its way, which will let consumers see which restaurants and stores are trending with positive or negative vibes lately.Once the Twitter directory is built out, it and the resulting Tweet stream will become available to developers through its new CityGrid APIs.  It could also make it easy for consumers to create Twitter lists of their favorite local shops and restaurants, or curate their own lists and maybe even charge on a clickthrough basis.  But maybe it should wait for Twitter to define its advertising rules before committing to any one model.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'One of the most potentially disruptive startups of  the last ten years is emerging into the light this week. And I honestly don&#8217;t say that lightly. Christian Lanng, a former builder of deep e-commerce and security services for the Danish government is co-founder of TradeShift along with a very hard-core team which includes John Bosak who created XML, who is on the board.But what is perhaps most startling is the re-emergence of early Skype investor Morten Lund on the project. Lund was made famous in tech circles both for his early Skype investment but also for going personally bankrupt two years ago.TradeShift, which has been operating under the stealth name of Porta till now, is aiming at a very, very big target. It wants to disrupt how banks and credit card companies process payments between any kind of business, and use the Internet to do it. For the last 10 months the dozen strong team in Denmark has been building what could be described most simply as an e-invoicing company.But instead of the kinds of charges levied for credit card processing and other banking systems, transactions will be free across the network, but with the security of being legally binding. That is incredibly disruptive.Financially it is backed by seed investors and is &#8220;currently self sufficient&#8221;.How so? TradeShift has now signed up two undisclosed regions in northern Europe and a yet to be named city in Brazil for its platform. Crucially, it looks like Tradeshift will be hugely beneficial to emerging nations like Brazil which currently are not locked into old EDI systems.The problem is simple. Businesses still trade on exchanging and printing out PDFs. Neither Microsoft not SAP haven&#8217;t solved this. So Tradeshift wants to let global SMEs participate in hard core business processes traditionally ruled by these companies.Old fashioned Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is dominated by huge IBM mainframes and pre-Internet protocols. Of course, it&#8217;s only natural that this should move  to cloud computing.The idea is this. Dynamic invoicing will, instead of being laborious hand-created entities, simply move between companies electronically. Accounts running on Tradeshift will constantly monitor exchange rates and automatically withdraw funds or make purchases just when the price is cheapest for the goods your company requires. The play is not to go to the US first with this, but for Europe and emerging marketing BRIC nations where their systems are being built right now. Europe is very mature for this sort of thing right now.At the core is UBL &#8211; a messaging standard similar to XML. The scenario facing businesses right now is 12/13 euro per invoice for existing systems. Make that 100 invoices and it starts to add up.This information is already available with existing real-time financial systems, so Tradeshift is building a platform on which these transactions can take place seamlessly. It will run its own applications on top of it, but the platform itslef will be made available so that other third party developers to create their own. Christian Lanng has 10 years of experience as former head of the Center for Service oriented Infrastructure in the Danish National IT and Telecom Agency. In other words he is right at the top of his game in working with mobile-services, e-business, SOA and large scale payment systems. &#8220;Tradeshift will be a like a GSM standard for e-business&#8221; Lanng told me at a meeting in London recently.There is an already existing &#8220;GSM-like&#8221; movement to create electronic standards across Europe. PEPPOL, Pan European Public Procurement Online is a vision to allow any company (incl. SMEs) in the EU to communicate electronically with any EU governmental institution for all procurement processes. The difference is that Tradeshift reckons it&#8217;s going to crack this for business to business transactions, and globally, not just in Europe.The core team is 13 people in Copenhagen, but includes people in Germany, Brazil and Sri Lanka, and totals up to 50 working on this.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Cooks on the go can locate recipes, save recipes to personal Recipe Boxes, rate recipes, share recipes and upload mobile images to Allrecipes. The app also includes a shopping list feature which aggregates ingredients across recipes and allows users to virtually check off items while shopping.Interestingly, the iPad may breathe new life into cooking and recipe apps. While reading recipes on the iPhone and other mobile devices while cooking can be tough; the iPad&#8217;s large screen almost simulates a digital cook book. And we all know that the iPad will be used as an e-book, allowing users to download and access cookbooks directly from their device.

Accroding to survey&#8217;s conducted by AllRecipes, one out of five people bring their laptops into the kitchen to access recipes.

       "  'comments_content': 'For brick and mortar retail shops, the biggest challenge right now is actually getting foot traffic in their stores. Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that retailer North Face is attempting to bring people into their stores by sending them text messages when they get near their retail outlets. That technology, called ShopAlerts, is powered by location-based advertising startup Placecast and is launching today as a full-fledged marketing service for retailers. Here&#8217;s how ShopAlerts works. Consumers can opt-in to receiving text messages in a variety of waysâ\\x80\\x94at the store, online, via text-message, mobile websites or on Facebook. Once the technology has been activated, consumers will be alerted when they are near a location that they are interested in or when the brand is offering sales and specials. ShopAlerts&#8217; technology uses &#8220;geo-fences,&#8221; which are virtual boundaries that can be targeted via location-based marketing. Retailers can customize alerts to fit their brand and strategy. On the consumer side, ShopAlerts will only send maximum number of 3 messages within a given week from a retailer. And users can opt out of the program by texting &#8220;stop&#8221; back to a text message.One of the benefits of ShopAlerts is that it works on both smartphones and non-smartphones, making it a compelling source of marketing and advertising for the 196 million Americans who do not own smartphones but may be interested in shopping alerts. Since September 2009, the ShopAlerts service has run pilot programs across the U.S. with several major retailers including North Face, American Eagle Outfitters, and REI. Based on a survey of consumer participants in the program, 60% of participants found the location-triggered messages to be innovative, 79% said it increased their likelihood to visit a store, 65% made a purchase as a result of a ShopAlerts message and 73% of participants would definitely or probably use the service in the future. Of course the biggest barrier to ShopAlerts gaining serious traction is if consumers choose not to opt-in to receive alerts via SMS. Launched in 2005, Placecast has raised $5 million in funding. The startup also offers a location-based advertising platform that weaves together location information and other data from audiences across the web, mobile, and email. Placecast will analyze inventory, segments audiences and targets ads for maximum relevance for advertisers and publishers. CrunchBase Information',\n",

What I would deem logical and not remarkable at all.AdMob further says iPhone users continue to download more paid applications, with 50 percent of users purchasing at least one paid application a month compared to 21 percent of Android users. The survey also included consumers on webOS devices and found that they downloaded fewer paid and free applications, although they remain active.AdMob says it stores and analyzes handset and operator data from every ad request in a network of more than 15,000 mobile Web sites and iPhone, Android, and webOS applications. The AdMob share is calculated by the percentage of requests received from a particular handset; it is a measure of relative mobile Web and application usage and does not represent handset sales.Additionally, AdMob claims that the number of ad requests to their network went up 32 percent between December and January, to a total of 15.2 billion ads.(Image via TiPb)CrunchBase Information',\n",

The company says that in January 2010, 50 million people used Opera Mini, a 7.4% increase from December 2009 and up 149% compared to January 2009. Collectively, Opera Mini users viewed more than 23.3 billion pages last month, up 12.7% since December 2009 and an increase of 208% since the same period last year.Opera&#8217;s servers processed more than 3 petabytes of data, Opera Software co-founder Jon von Tetzchner writes.

       "  'comments_content': 'I just finished reading a very unsettling blog post by serial entrepreneur Jason Goldberg, whose new startup fabulis has apparently had its bank account blocked by Citibank over posting &#8220;objectionable content&#8221; on its company blog, at least according to a bank employee he spoke to on the phone. (see update below)Fabulis is described on the blog as &#8220;the social network that helps gay men connect with amazing experiences nearby and around the world&#8221;. Could that be what Citibank is objecting against rather than the content on the blog, which is perfectly innocent any way you look at it indeed?Now, in case you don&#8217;t know Goldberg: he&#8217;s an accomplished Internet entrepreneur, who had stints at the White House, AOL and T-Mobile under his belt before founding Jobster (and raising more than $50 million for the startup) and after that socialmedian (which he sold to Xing in December 2008).For his latest startup fabulis, Goldberg has raised $625k in seed funding from the likes of Washington Post and Venture Partner at Mayfield Fund Allen Morgan, and essentially aims to become the leading social network and lifestyle website for homosexual men.Which is challenging if your financial institution freezes your bank account and marks it for immediate termination after reading a couple of your &#8211; again, perfectly harmless &#8211; company blog posts.This is Goldberg&#8217;s take on the blocking of the account:In a bit of strange and disturbing news, fabulis discovered today that someone(s) at Citibank had decided arbitrarily to block fabulisâ\\x80\\x99 bank account due to what was described to us on the phone as â\\x80\\x9cobjectionable contentâ\\x80\\x9d on our blog.  In fact, the account â\\x80\\x94 it turns out â\\x80\\x94 was blocked a few days ago without anyone letting us know about it by phone or email.Huh?Mind you, fabulis is a serious business, backed by some serious players, and for the life of us we canâ\\x80\\x99t find anything â\\x80\\x9cobjectionableâ\\x80\\x9d on our blog besides some good humor, some business insights, and some touching coming out stories from some great and fabulis gay people.So, what gives?And wtf. When did Citibank start reviewing blogs to decide who can bank with them?Calls into Citibank tonight resulted in a temporary lifting of the block while a compliance officer is asked to re-review our website on Thursday. Stay tuned â\\x80¦ weâ\\x80\\x99ll update you on this shocker as we learn more.WTF indeed.Whatever update comes, this is a PR nightmare for Citibank, and I&#8217;ll be curious to see what the company has to say about this atrocity. In a comment on Hacker News, Goldberg says he doesn&#8217;t think Citibank is being homophobic, and calls out moronic behavior instead:Do I think Citibank or Citigroup is a homophobic malicious company? No. Do I think some compliance officer is a moron who made a really stupid decision? Yes. Three hours of trying to sort this out provided even more comedic insanity than I even revealed on the blog post. Including a bank manager who didn&#8217;t want to talk about this because she was uncomfortable talking about the content of our blog over a recorded phone conversation. Oh, and we&#8217;ve learned that the account was marked to be a cancelled by said compliance officer for this &#8220;objectionable content.&#8221; wtf.All we know so far is that we finally got someone to lift the block on the account, but that the best she could promise is another review of the situation today.insanity.Very uncomfortable for sure, but mostly for Citibank, who for the record, apparently does not want to be reached by e-mail even by press. So even if there&#8217;s a perfectly reasonable explanation to this &#8211; that the bank&#8217;s allowed to share publicly &#8211; I can only hope to reach someone by phone when it&#8217;s morning in the U.S. who can look into it and tell us what&#8217;s up.Update: In a new blog post, Goldberg says that he spoke with a Citibank employee about the issue, and was told that the bank had decided to terminate the startupâ\\x80\\x99s account because the â\\x80\\x9ccontent was not in compliance with Citibankâ\\x80\\x99s standard policies.â\\x80\\x9d He adds that the bankâ\\x80\\x99s management promised to review the situation later today.Update 2: A second update on the fabulis blog says a representative has called and apologized. According to Goldberg, the bank spokesperson said that â\\x80\\x9call 3 of the citibank individuals who over the past 24 hours each individually claimed that fabulisâ\\x80\\x99 account was to be terminated for compliance issues around the content of our site, were all wrong to have said what they said.â\\x80\\x9dNo kidding. As Goldberg concludes: &#8220;Hmph. Something smells.&#8221;Update 3: Goldberg now received an apology by e-mail from a Bill Brown, who says he&#8217;s responsible for the Citibank Branches in Manhattan, and the entrepreneur says he&#8217;s accepted the apology. This is what the e-mail read:Jason,We have not been formally introduced and I imagine that this is a poor way to become acquainted.  I am responsible for the Citibank Branches in Manhattan and have just learned today of the challenges you have experienced in opening an account with us.I apologize for any confusion about the status of your account and the Fabulis website.  Whatever statements that were made by any Citi representative related to the content of your website were inappropriate and made in error, and I will review in detail what happened. You have my firm commitment on this point.I truly regret any unintended message that my employees may have conveyed about your new business venture.  I place great value on your business and assure you that Citi is committed to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities.  In fact, this week Citi has announced the financing for the True Colors Residence, a housing facility for homeless GLBT youth in New York City.I recognize that, to this point, this dialogue has been carried out on the internet via postings.  You may choose to post this apology, however, please do not doubt the sincerity of my message and the responsibility I have for ensuring our customers do not encounter a similar experience.Safe travels,Bill BrownI still say they should move to another bank just to make a solid point.(Thanks to GigaOm for pointing out the updates to this story first)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A few days ago, I noted that Seesmic Web had perfected the management of Twitter contacts. I was wrong. A new service has been brought to my attention that is much, much better. Actually, it&#8217;s a must-use.While Seesmic Web is great for a number of things (it&#8217;s arguably the best Twitter web client out there), ManageTwitter is great at one thing: managing your Twitter followers. To use it, you simply link up your Twitter account (via OAuth) and it lets you know which of the Twitter users you follow aren&#8217;t following you back, who is inactive, who is talkative, and who is quiet. Each of these are great gauges for whether you should still be following them or not.Personally, I was able to eliminate over 200 people I was following that I determined I shouldn&#8217;t be. Most of these were users I followed a couple years ago that either were simply not using the service any more, or were no longer that interesting to me.Unfollowing users is as simple as selecting their name and clicking the &#8220;unfollow&#8221; button. You can also do this in bulk. And hovering over any users gives you more information about them including their average tweets per day. You can also sort the various ManageTwitter fields by &#8216;date followed,&#8217; &#8216;username,&#8217; &#8216;followers,&#8217; or &#8216;timezone.&#8217;While there are no shortage of services that recommend people you should follow, I&#8217;ve long needed one to suggest who I maybe shouldn&#8217;t be following. Of those, ManageTwitter is easily the best.Created by the Australian company Melon Media, the site notes that it has unfollowed 17092 people for 381 users in the past 3 days.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Editor&#8217;s note: This guest post is written by Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of salesforce.com.  In it, he explains why enterprise software should take its cues from Facebook and become more social.I quit my job at Oracle in 1999 because I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about a simple question: â\\x80\\x9cWhy isnâ\\x80\\x99t all enterprise software like Amazon.com?â\\x80\\x9d  Why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t applications be run from a simple website, without software or hardware to install, and pricy consultants to hire?  Why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t we just compute in the Internet, or the cloud, and get away from the data center and all its complexity. Simply put, I wanted to simplify the enterprise. It was a pretty straight-forward idea, but from the confines in which I sat, there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t anything close to a straight-forward solution.That vision led to the founding of salesforce.com. But the enterprise world wasnâ\\x80\\x99t ready for Amazon.com, or eBay, or Yahoo, or any of the innovative services that were changing the way consumers bought, sold, or communicated. I tell this story in my book Behind the Cloud and canâ\\x80\\x99t help but note that the factors at play 10 years agoâ\\x80\\x94an inspiring service, wide skepticism, and phenomenal potentialâ\\x80\\x94mirror where we are today. But itâ\\x80\\x99s no longer Amazon that frames the questions or gives us the answers.In this decade, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve become obsessed with a new simple question: â\\x80\\x9cWhy isnâ\\x80\\x99t all enterprise software like Facebook?â\\x80\\x9d As we were focused on bringing enterprise computing into the modern age, Facebook redefined the values of consumer computing and helped ignite the social phenomenon. The compelling aspect of feeds, profiles, and groups, amplify the serviceâ\\x80\\x99s stickiness. So does its functionality on a mobile device like an iphoneâ\\x80\\x94necessary to secure a serviceâ\\x80\\x99s status as a â\\x80\\x9ckiller app.â\\x80\\x9d  Facebook is where I start my day to find out what my friends and family are doing. Itâ\\x80\\x99s where I go to see the important events in my social life.  Everything I care about and need to know is pushed to meâ\\x80\\x94and it requires no work on my part.What does the social revolution mean for business, though? So far it hasnâ\\x80\\x99t meant much. Currently, our methods of collaboration are defined by Lotus Notes or Microsoft SharePoint, but these tools havenâ\\x80\\x99t kept up with the changing times. They were conceived before anyone knew what a â\\x80\\x9cnewsfeedâ\\x80\\x9d was. (In fact, Notes was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg was!) Today, realtime information is possible, which has changed everything: How people consume information has changed, how people learn things about each other has changed, and how people stay current has changed. Most of all, our expectations around immediacy have changed.Now, we need to take this idea to our businesses. We need to transform the business conversation the same way Facebook has changed the consumer conversation. Market shifts happen in real time, deals are won and lost in real time, and data changes in real time. Yet the software we use to run our enterprises is in anything but real time. We need tools that work smarter, make better use of new technology (like the mobile devices in everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s hands), and fully leverage the opportunities of the Internet.New realtime cloud applications, platforms, and infrastructure offer the path to redefine the future of collaboration. Now in beta, Salesforce Chatter takes the best of Facebook, Twitter, and other social leaders, for instance, and applies it to enterprise collaborationâ\\x80\\x94making people more productive and businesses more competitive. I already see it working: I have an enterprise desktop where without any effort I can learn about what my team is focusing on, how my projects are progressing, and what deals are closing. It is fundamentally changing the way our organization collaborates on product development, customer acquisition, and content creationâ\\x80\\x94making it all easier than ever before.We are on the precipice of a major shift in our industry.  It stems from a change we badly needed and the once-in-a-decade question we had to ask.  And this time, we are all ready for the answers.  Luckily, this time, I donâ\\x80\\x99t have to leave my job to find out what they are. CrunchBase Information',\n",

And that&#8217;s just fine with me because those are about the only video games where I can hold my own.  Online video arcade OMGPOP&#8217;s latest game is a remake of Atari&#8217;s Missile Command on its 30th anniversary.  The OMGPOP version is true to the original except it adds a multiplayer twist.  It&#8217;s pretty addictive and the social aspect makes it more fun.  Just like at the old coin arcades, it was always better when you went with a couple of friends.Like most OMGPOP games you can enter a live match with other players or invite your friends to meet you in a game room.  You can sign in with Facebook Connect or AIM.  OMGPOP matches you with players at about the same level as you.  You can get more missiles, enlarge their impact radius, or increase your reload rate buy using your health points to buy better capabilities.  If things are going really badly you can buy a nuke for 500 &#8220;coins.&#8221;  You earn coins the more you play, but you can also pay for them straight out through PayPal or a credit card.  Selling virtual goods is OMGPOP&#8217;s main source of revenues.  The site has about a dozen games. CEO Dan Porter (who used to be the president of Teach For America, TicketWeb before it sold to TicketMaster, and worked as a corporate VC for Virgin) says that about 2 to 5 percent of players end up actually paying for something.  About 30 percent of its virtual goods revenues come from third-party offers from TrialPay, but they try to keep the scammier offers out. Porter says the site has 2.5 million members, and about 1 million monthly unique visitors.  Most of those are high school and college students.  The site is still small but has a loyal following.  About 40 pecent of users visit the site more than 50 times a month.  I recently visited OMGPOP&#8217;s New York City offices, where Porter, founder Charles Forman, and game developer Will Chen gave me a preview of Missile Command in the video below.  I also get Forman to weigh in on the HTML5 Vs. Flash debate.  He says there is no way he could create the games on OMGPOP without Flash.    CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Facebook has been doing background checks, known as due diligence, on the location-based social network Loopt, a source with knowledge of the talks tells us. Generally speaking, due diligence of this kind is only performed when a company is in acquisition or fundraising talks.Loopt won&#8217;t comment on this story, and a Facebook spokesperson says &#8220;As a practical matter, we don&#8217;t comment on rumor and speculation.&#8221;There is no indication that Facebook has made an actual offer to buy Loopt at this time, and in fact we don&#8217;t even have direct information that negotiations are taking place. But it&#8217;s clear that Facebook is at least considering acquiring Loopt, and/or others in this space.It&#8217;s also not clear that Facebook is the only company taking a look at Loopt. Google is also highly interested in the mobile social and location space. Their recent launch of Buzz, which allows check-ins of locations via a mobile device, is just one indication of that.But Facebook is clearly furthest behind. They have one of the most popular mobile applications but have to date ignored location features and the increasingly popular checking-in at locations via mobile devices. Part of their hesitation is likely due to privacy concerns around disclosing location information, even at the user&#8217;s request. But they&#8217;ve also clearly just sat on the sidelines as well as the space developed, and recently surged in activity.It&#8217;s time for Facebook to make their move. Jupiter Research recently stated that location based services could generate nearly $13 billion in revenue by 2014. Facebook wants their share of that.Loopt competitors like Foursquare and Gowalla have the biggest press footprint with mobile location applications, getting lots of attention from the early adopters in Silicon Valley. But Loopt has the most users by far. And they also have longstanding carrier relationships that bring in real revenue.Loopt was one of the hot location-based networks early on, with founder Sam Altman even getting stage time during the initial App Store unveiling event. But Loopt, like Google&#8217;s Latitude, was intially built around the &#8220;always-on&#8221; idea of location. This is something that hurt it because the iPhone did not allow third-party applications to run in the background. Meanwhile, &#8220;check-in&#8221; based services like Foursquare and Gowalla grew in popularity. Loopt has since repositioned itself as more of a check-in based service, but despite its large user base, it&#8217;s not clear if its users will adapt to this change.In January, we published a deck Loopt was sending out to potential advertisers pitching them about a new app completely built around the idea of check-in specials. Notably, this app was to be entirely built on top of Facebook&#8217;s social graph, utilizing Facebook Connect. This app is an offshoot of GeoGraffiti, a Y Combinator startup that Loopt itself acquired last year.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The company has also posted an invite to its blog, along with a not-so-subtle jab at its competitors: &#8220;Forget all that over-hyped chatter and annoying buzz, Yammer is releasing the next wave in Enterprise Microblogging&#8220;.So what exactly is Yammer about to introduce?  We&#8217;re hearing from one source that the company is planning to start allowing people to create networks that aren&#8217;t built around web domains.  That may not sound like a big deal, but it would be a major change for Yammer, and one that could open it up to a huge number of new users.Until now, in order to create a Yammer network you&#8217;ve needed to have email addresses associated with your own  business domain name (say, jason@company.com) . This works great for sizable companies (everyone who has an email account on that domain is automatically placed into the correct network), but it&#8217;s a big limitation on who can actually use the service â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0plenty of businesses and organizations don&#8217;t have their own domain names.Depending on how Yammer rolls this out, there could be countless uses for this. Â\\xa0Last summer, I wrote about how useful it would be to have a Yammer for families that would allow family members to easily share information in a centralized place (and get SMS alerts if something important came up). Â\\xa0Local groups could set up Yammer accounts to share information instead of relying on long Email chains, and so on.  But Yammer wouldn&#8217;t be alone here â\\x80\\x94 a recentlyÂ\\xa0launched startup called HipChat is already going after this broad market.We&#8217;ll have more details tomorrow at 11 AM.

This is believed to be one of the deals currently earning Foursquare some revenue.While the company is making some revenue, it&#8217;s not yet profitable, and the focus remains on building the product and gaining users. Currently, Foursquare is closing in on 500,000 users, but with a cable television commercial, those numbers could soar.The service is in the process of revamping its website and several of its mobile applications.

Google first revealed that this was coming back in December, when it first started including real-time data in its search results.

       "  'comments_content': 'hi5, one of the world&#8217;s most popular social networks, has been actively remodeling its site to cater to the gaming industry.  Last fall, the social network launched a totally revamped site that places a much stronger emphasis on games and virtual currency, along with a new avatar system. Today, the company is furthering this strategy with the acquisition of social gaming developer Big Six. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. See the full release below.Big Six&#8217;s founders, Kevin Gliner, Monty Kerr and Chad Hansing,  will join the hi5 management team. Hi5 says the deal will boost the social networks efforts in developing in commerce platforms and payment processing offerings. Right now, gaming is a central part of hi5&#8217;s strategy for growth so it makes sens for the social network to acquire innovative technologies and talent. The games section of hi5&#8217;s site  accounts for around 1/3 of the siteâ\\x80\\x99s traffic, and direct user payments through the game already account for 15% of hi5â\\x80\\x99s revenue.Apart from the currency and payments technology, Big Six&#8217;s social gaming platform will also become part of hi5. With the massive success of Zynga and Playfish, it makes sense that hi5 would try to create a social network that centers around gaming itself. hi5 has over 60 million members, which is a far cry from Facebook&#8217;s 400 million users. In December, hi5 brought on a new president, gaming industry veteran, Alex St. John, to help lead the social network&#8217;s efforts. Earlier in the year, the company suffered from layoffs and also hired a new CEO, Bill Gossman. hi5, the largest social entertainment site focused on gaming, today announced the acquisition of social gaming company Big Six. The Austin-based company was founded by gaming veterans Kevin Gliner, Monty Kerr and Chad Hansing, all of whom will join the hi5 management team, as announced separately today. The deal enhances hi5â\\x80\\x99s growing leadership in commerce for virtual goods and games.  Building on hi5â\\x80\\x99s current commerce platform, which includes a global virtual currency called hi5 Coins, support for over 60 payment methods worldwide, and new advertising-based transactional capabilities â\\x80\\x93 the Big Six acquisition brings significant new technology and software platforms in the areas of payment processing, fraud detection and conversion optimization. In addition to its proprietary commerce platform, Big Six also designed a social gaming platform which will become part of the core hi5 site. â\\x80\\x9cThe Big Six team and technology are a perfect complement to what we have already developed at hi5,&#8221; said Bill Gossman, CEO of hi5.  â\\x80\\x9cOver the last two years, we have made a substantial investment in building out the industryâ\\x80\\x99s most robust commerce infrastructure for virtual goods and gaming and this acquisition will considerably augment both our commerce platform and domain expertise.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe are excited to be joining a company that shares our philosophy and vision for how social gaming will evolve,â\\x80\\x9d said Kevin Gliner, co-founder and CEO, Big Six.  â\\x80\\x9cThis deal is a perfect match because it enables us to accelerate our go-to-market plans by leveraging hi5â\\x80\\x99s huge global audience.â\\x80\\x9dCrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A bill introduced today in the Senate by Democrat John Kerry and Republican Richard Lugar proposes a new type of visa for immigrants who create startups and jobs in the U.S.  A similar proposal is part of an immigration reform bill in the House.  The Startup Visa has been controversial and will no doubt draw fire from anti-immigrant forces and xenophobes.  But if we are going to be giving away visas, giving them to people who will help build the U.S. economy and create jobs is hard to argue against.The Startup Visa Act of 2010 would create a two year visa for immigrant entrepreneurs who are able to raise a minimum of $250,000, with $100,000 coming from a qualified U.S. angel or venture investor.  After two years, if the immigrant entrepreneur is able to create five or more jobs (not including their children or spouse), attract an additional $1 million in investment, or produce $1 million in revenues, he or she will become a legal resident.The bill would carve out a new &#8220;EB-6&#8243; class of visas from the existing &#8220;EB-5&#8243; class of visas which has a higher threshold for becoming a legal resident.  So it&#8217;s not really that radical.  The EB-5 requires immigrants to invest at least $1 million in the U.S. and employ ten people.The Startup Visa sends the right message to prospective immigrants: create jobs, get a green card.  A group of 160 venture capitalists and angel investors support the bill, including Paul Graham, Brad Feld, Fred Wilson, Dave McClure, Ron Conway, Mike Maples, Reid Hoffman, Chris Sacca, Jeff Clavier, Bijan Sabet, Josh Kopelman, and Chris Dixon.  If you agree that the Startup Visa is a good idea, you can find ways to support it here and here.',\n",

It&#8217;s no longer enough to simply be a web site, everyone wants to be a platform, and APIs are the hooks that enable that by way of data.

And today that vision is being rewarded again with a $5.5 million Series C round of funding.The round, led by Cisco, is also being participated in by existing investors, Formative Ventures, First Round Capital, and 406 Ventures. Cisco, which is a key player in networking, video, mobile, and cloud services is a good investor for Mashery to pick up as the web continues to evolve to new devices and move towards the cloud.

While there are still plenty of people who can&#8217;t even spell &#8216;API&#8217;, we&#8217;re seeing some amazing brands not just testing the waters of innovation for the sake of innovation, but actually driving significant revenue and business growth through their API,&#8221; Mashery Â\\xa0CEO Oren Michels tells us. He continues, &#8220;More and more companies are seeing the power of putting their services &#8211; whether they be e-commerce, media, data, or anything else &#8211; where their customers want to interact with them rather than expecting their customers to do everything at the company&#8217;s website. Opening an API is the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to interact with users on third party platforms and mobile devices, and to enable new services that they couldn&#8217;t offer themselves. I&#8217;m really excited to see how this will grow in the next few years.&#8221;With the new money, Mashery will expand its product as well as hire more people in sales and marketing to further cement itself in certain verticals. Currently, Mashery has over 40,000 developers connected to its network which includes clients such as Best Buy, Netflix, Reuters, the New York Times, and Trulia.Mashery had raised $8.2 million over its previous rounds, so the new money brings that total up to $13.7 million.

       "  'comments_content': 'After eight years of operating in quasi-stealth, Bloom Energy came out with a bang today at an event in Silicon Valley attended by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Colin Powell, Larry Page, John Doerr, and executives from eBay, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and FedEx.  All of the big-name companies, including Google, are beta customers of Bloom&#8217;s distributed energy fuel cell technology (which was the subject of a 60 Minutes profile on Sunday and various other stories since then).  Doerr, the Kleiner Perkins VC who backed both Bloom and Google, said today: &#8220;This Is Like The Google IPO.&#8221;  Except without the IPO part.  Doerr was referring to the fact that, like Google, Bloom has kept its business close to its vest until it actually could show some progress in terms of customers and products.  Five Bloom energy boxes about the size of a parking space each now provide 15 percent of the power at eBay&#8217;s campus.  Walmart is testing the boxes in two locations where it is carrying 60 to 80 percent of the energy load of an entire store.  Google co-founder Larry Page calls the technology a &#8220;very big deal&#8221; and looks forward to the day that it can expand the number of Bloom boxes Google uses to the point where it can power one of its data centers.Bloom founder and CEO KR Sridhar, who got his start designing technologies for NASA that would allow humans to live on Mars, explained how Bloom&#8217;s fuel cell technology works.  It takes almost any fuel from ethanol to biomass and turns it into electricity.  Fuel cells are nothing new, but Bloom has figured out a way to make them cheaply and efficiently.  A Sridhar claims that a Bloom box, which he calls an energy server, is twice as efficient as the electricity grid.  &#8220;For the same amount of electricity, you need half the fuel,&#8221; he says.  &#8220;If you use a renewable fuel you are carbon neutral. Use all the electricity you want and donâ\\x80\\x99t feel guilty about polluting the environment.&#8221;Each fuel cell, which is made from sand essentially (zirconium oxide), is a square wafer about the size of a CD box.  Each wafer can produce about 25 watts of energy, enough to power a lightbulb. Stack them together and you get a box that could power a house.  Group them into larger units, and you get enough energy to power a building or an entire campus.  He calls them energy servers because they are modular like servers in a data center. Need more energy?  Add more boxes.They are like backyard generators. No electricity is lost through distribution, and they can convert a variety of fuels into electricity, allowing customers to use whatever is locally available or cheapest.  There are no moving parts, vents, or discharge other than heat.  Right now, only businesses and large facilities can afford these things.  They cost about $750,000 for a 100 kilowatt system (Google is using a 400 kilowatt systems to power one building on its campus, and the Walmart stores are also using 400 kilowatt systems).  Nevertheless, Bloom says the systems should pay for themselves within three to five years because of lower electricity costs.  A typical electricity cost for commercial customers is 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour versus 13 cents for what they might pay a California utility.  That 3 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour in savings adds up if you are running a huge retail store or a data center.The costs should come down over time to the point where Bloom boxes really can be used in homes. One potentially disruptive feature of the technology is that it works both ways: fuel can produce electricity, but it can also go the other way so that electricity produces fuel.  Sridhar foresees the killer app for his technology becoming practical in about a decade: a Bloom home energy server combined with solar panels or some other renewable energy.  The electricity from the solar panels could produce fuel, which can be used to produce electricity to power the house or even to gas up your (modified) car.Dreams like those are the kind that fuel something else: big IPOs.

       "  'comments_content': 'When it was announced that retailer Walmart would buy streaming movie startup Vudu a couple days ago, a number of sites wondered what it would mean for Vudu&#8217;s adult content. Here&#8217;s what it means: bye bye.An email is currently being sent out by Vudu letting its After Dark (the adult portion of its service run with adult publication AVN) partners that the section will be discontinued in the &#8220;coming days.&#8221; Find the full email at the bottom of this post.Vudu has the distinction of being the only major streaming service with an adult section which includes hundreds of titles (including many in HD) from the leading porn studios. This section also allowed for &#8220;discreet billing&#8221; so movie titles wouldn&#8217;t appear on statements. Walmart, on the other hand, couldn&#8217;t be any more the opposite with regard to its adult content policy. As in, there is none allowed in its stores. Famously, in some cases it will also only agree to carry edited versions of explicit music albums.This move comes at a time when Apple is also removing what it considers to be explicit material from the App Store (though none of it was technically porn). Though there are now hints it may launch a new explicit area of the store at a later time.Below, find the email going out to Vudu partners. As you can see, it&#8217;s asking partners to voluntary terminate the agreement amicably, even though the existing terms aren&#8217;t up yet. We&#8217;ve reached out to Vudu and Walmart about the shutdown, but they have yet to get back to us. We&#8217;ll update when they do.Dear VUDU After Dark Partner,As you may have recently heard, VUDU was acquired by Wal-Mart.  In conjunction with this acquisition we will be discontinuing the â\\x80\\x9cAfter Darkâ\\x80\\x9d adult service over the coming days.  Upon completion of the shutdown process, we will settle all accounts with you and ensure that you are paid the full amount you are owed under our existing agreement.Attached to this agreement, please find a voluntary termination notice to our existing distribution agreement.  As there has been no breach of contract by either party, there are no grounds to terminate the agreement under its existing terms.  However, given the discontinuation of After Dark,  we believe it makes sense for both sides to voluntary terminate the agreement.  The alternative is to allow the agreement to expire under the existing terms, but we believe this is cleaner for all parties.We ask that you complete, sign and return this termination notice at your earliest convenience.  Please let me know if you have any questions.Update: A Walmart spokesperson further confirms the news:&#8220;I can confirm that we no longer offer that content and that customers who previously purchased movies with adult content will receive a full refund.&#8221;CrunchBase Information',\n",

The main findings are:â\\x9e¤ 78 percent of adults are Internet users, whether that means broadband, dial-up, access from home or access from someplace other than home.â\\x9e¤ 74 percent of adults have access at home. â\\x9e¤ 67 percent of U.S. households contain a broadband userwho accesses the service at home. â\\x9e¤ 65 percent of adults are broadband adopters. The dis-crepancy of two percentage points between household and individual home use is because some survey respon- dents are nonbroadband users but live with someone who, at home, is.â\\x9e¤ 6 percent of Americans use dial-up Internet connections as their main form of home access.â\\x9e¤ 6 percent are Internet users but do not use it from home; they access the Internet from places such as work, the library or community centers.In a survey of 5,005 Americans &#8211; a fairly small sample, to be sure &#8211; found that college educated Americans earning $75K+ are most likely to have broadband while the lowest penetration is in folks over 65+ and Hispanics. While this is hardly a surprise, extrapolating out to get 93 million potential non-broadband users is slightly disconcerting. Sure, the jokes here write themselves (&#8220;Oh no! The old can&#8217;t use Facebook!&#8221;), the fact that broadband is out of reach for folks in lower-income brackets and for minorities creates another educational chasm we&#8217;re going to have to deal with sooner than later.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Looking at blogs and news sites across the web, it&#8217;s clear that many have robust communities with eager, intelligent people looking to contribute.  But up until recently, the only way most sites (particularly blogs) allow users to share their thoughts is through comments, which work well enough, but certainly aren&#8217;t always perfect.  Grogger is a new service that looks to help sites tap into this community knowledge, allowing you to build a site that includes posts written by both you and your audience.At its core, Grogger is an easy-to-use blogging platform, but rather than only exposing its editing tools to a handful of site administrators, they&#8217;re shown to everyone.  When a user comes to your Grogger site and writes an entry (called a Grog), you can have it directly posted to your blog, or added to a moderation queue, where your site administrators can approve it.  Once an entry has been approved, other users can vote it up using a &#8216;Like&#8217; system, and administrators can &#8216;feature&#8217; it to make it even more prominent.  And while readers are free to contribute their own Grogs, they can also leave old-school comments under posts by other writers.Grogger tracks each user&#8217;s profile over time, allowing you to quickly look up all of their previous posts.  You can also elect to only follow certain writers if you want to tweak your reading experience (and Grogs can be broken up into categories). Frequent contributors are rewarded through a badge system. The site has only one theme available at this point, but more are coming in the near future, and you can manually edit the CSS if you want to get creative.Grogger is still pretty early on (I ran into a few bugs, and some of the UI isn&#8217;t that intuitive), but it&#8217;s got potential.  The site is now open to the public and is free, with plans to eventually roll out some premium options.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Two law firms, Beck &amp; Lee from Miami and The Weston Firm in San Diego, have filed a class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court alleging unfair business practices by local business review and rating website operator Yelp.The plaintiff in the suit, a veterinary hospital in Long Beach, CA, is said to have requested that Yelp remove a negative review from the website, which was allegedly refused by the San Francisco startup, after which its sales representatives repeatedly contacted the hospital demanding payments of roughly $300 per month in exchange for hiding or deleting the review.Sounds familiar, you say?You may be thinking of last year, when East Bay Express ran an explosive story, basically accusing Yelp of being in the &#8216;Business of Extortion 2.0&#8242;, which covered similar ground. Shortly after reporter Kathleen Richards published the article, Yelp vehemently denied everything and called her piece inaccurate.Now, the company will have to defend itself in court rather than on its company blog.The lawsuit essentially alleges that the heavily funded startup runs an &#8220;extortion scheme&#8221; and has &#8220;unscrupulous sales practices&#8221; in place to generate revenue, in which the companyâ\\x80\\x99s employees call businesses demanding monthly payments in the guise of advertising contracts, in exchange for removing or modifying negative reviews.The case, which is styled Cats and Dogs Animal Hospital Inc. v. Yelp Inc., was filed on February 23, 2010, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. We have an e-mail in with Yelp and are awaiting a response.Update: a Yelp representative commented as follows:Yelp provides a valuable service to millions of consumers and businesses based on our trusted content. The allegations are demonstrably false, since many businesses that advertise on Yelp have both negative and positive reviews. These businesses realize that both kinds of feedback provide authenticity and value. Running a good business is hard; filing a lawsuit is easy. While we haven&#8217;t seen the suit in question, we will dispute it aggressively.The class action lawsuit comes mere weeks after Yelp took a large investment from Elevation Partners, and months after we reported the company walked away from a $550 million Google acquisition deal.(Image via Gawker)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Every entrepreneur is familiar with the moment. The moment when you stumble across an annoying problem &#8211; a problem that you&#8217;d pay money to solve &#8211; and suddenly a synapse fires in your brain. &#8220;Holy crap, if I&#8217;d pay money to solve this, so would other people. There&#8217;s a business here!&#8221;.It&#8217;s the moment that has kick started a million businesses and generated billions of dollars over the decades. And on Sunday evening, not for the first time in what I laughingly call my career, I experienced it. I&#8217;d filed my TechCrunch column earlier in the day and with little else planned, I decided to relax by watching some old episodes of Jonathan Creek: the BBC comedy drama about a magician&#8217;s assistant who solves seemingly impossible crimes. The show ran for four series in the UK between 1997 &#8211; 2004 and, I think, was also shown on BBC America. I&#8217;ve looked for the DVDs over here but I can&#8217;t find them, nor can I find a legal way to view them online. Like the petty criminal that I am, then, I headed to YouTube. Sure enough all four series were there, as was a recent one-off reunion special.As I worked my way through the entire back catalogue, I remembered just how great a show Jonathan Creek is. David Renwick&#8217;s scripts are brilliant &#8211; apparently each one took him several months to write, thanks to the intricacies of the puzzles each episode contains. The show is so good in fact, that I started to feel guilty: I know that Renwick isn&#8217;t going to receive a single penny of residual payment from my YouTube viewing. If only there was some way to contact him, tell him how much I enjoy the show, and offer to send him some money for the lost DVD sale. (Note: it&#8217;s not the BBC I care about losing money &#8211; they can afford it &#8211; but Renwick himself.)And then I realised that I&#8217;m not alone in having this desire, or alone in wanting to pay money to solve it. In fact several times recently I&#8217;ve found myself on the other side of the equation. Back in December, I decided to give away the US ebook edition of my last book for free, online. My reason for doing so are outlined here &#8211; basically it wasn&#8217;t widely available in the US and I wanted people here to read it so they might buy my next one.Since then I&#8217;ve had several dozen emails, tweets and other digital notes from people who have read the book for free, asking if there&#8217;s any way they can retroactively pay me some money to say thank you. No, really. Most asked for my Paypal details, or a way to send a check for the ebook cover price of $9.99. Others offered to buy me $9.99Â\\xa0 worth of beer at events they knew I&#8217;d be attending; an offer which would have been much more enticing had I not given up drinking last October.And that&#8217;s when I had the moment. I want to pay David Renwick for work of his that I&#8217;ve already enjoyed, but I can&#8217;t. People want to pay me for work of mine, but &#8211; except through some tortuous email exchange, which resulted in me turning down the dozens of offers of money because it seemed somehow weird &#8211; they can&#8217;t.I thought of putting a note on my site suggesting that people donate to charity instead, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out the best way to implement that, or to thank/reward the people who did. Equally, there&#8217;s no way of me finding out what Renwick would like me to do to reward him &#8211; send him a check? Donate to charity? Buy something from his Amazon wishlist? Does he even have one?Of course, I&#8217;m not the first person to realise that there&#8217;s a need for content creators to be rewarded for stuff that is consumed for free online. Peter Sunde, the founder of Pirate Bay, recently announced the launch of Flattr, his micropayment service that allows creators to be paid tiny amounts of money for their work.Subscribers pay $5 a month, which is then divided up equally between all of the Flattr-enabled sites that the user wants to reward during that period. Setting aside the irony that the guy behind Pirate Bay is now claiming that creating content should be rewarded ( &#8220;People love things and they want to pay&#8221; he told the BBC, with a straight face), the fact remains that Flattr is a terrible idea.Dividing your monthly subscription equally amongst all of the sites you enjoy means that the more you use the service, the less each site gets. And given that all of these services have a minimum pay-out (usually between $50-$100), it will be a long time before most creators will see any real reward. Also, the service puts all of the effort in the wrong place. I&#8217;m simply not going to sign up for $5 a month in the hope that the creators I enjoy will all use Flattr. There are a whole load of competitors: Sprinklepenny, Kachingle et al&#8230;I&#8217;d have to sign up to them all to cover all my bases.For me, as someone who straddles both sides of the creator/audience fence, the idea of micropayments as a way to reward creators is a non-starter, mainly because it fundamentally misunderstands the psychology of why we want to reward creators.Sure, part of the reason I want to pay David Renwick is guilt &#8211; a desire to do the right thing. But even that guilt has selfish motivations: if Renwick isn&#8217;t properly rewarded for creating something that gives me so much pleasure, I&#8217;m worried that he might be discouraged from continuing. I want to encourage him to carry on writing, so I can carry on enjoying.Much more powerful is the fanboy motivation. Within all fans, there&#8217;s a subconscious desire for the artists they admire to be aware of that admiration. That&#8217;s why people send fan letters &#8211; not because they&#8217;re expecting a reply, although that&#8217;s a nice bonus &#8211; but rather for the fantasy that the artist will read it. We want a connection with our heroes. Allied to that desire to be noticed, is the desire for our peers to appreciate our generosity. There&#8217;s a reason why charity donation sites usually display the names of donors, and the amounts they&#8217;ve donated.Â\\xa0 It&#8217;s an ego thing &#8211; if I see that my peers have donated an average of $10, I want to donate $20 to prove I&#8217;m more generous &#8211; and it drives the average donation upwards.Giving 1c, or even $1, as part of a regular monthly split through services like Flattr does nothing to satisfy any of those desires. Splitting a regular monthly payment between dozens of creators doesn&#8217;t allow me to form a connection with any one of them. Such tiny amounts won&#8217;t encourage them to keep creating, nor will they allow me to show off my generosity to my peers. And of course, the chances of my favourite creator being registered with Flattr or any other single payment service is close to nil.For all of those reasons, micropayment services are a non starter. An embarrassment, even.Instead what someone needs to build is a macropayment service. A way to make a one-off payment to a specific creator to thank them for their entire body of work. If you insist on using a &#8216;micro&#8217; word, then the correct one is &#8216;micropatronage&#8217;: an affordable version of the age-old practice of wealthy patrons supporting artists in substantive, public ways &#8211; ways that stroke the patron&#8217;s ego and/or guarantee their place in heaven.Specifically, I&#8217;d love to see a service that allows me to reward David Renwick &#8211; or any other writer, journalist, artist, singer, filmmaker, or content creator &#8211; for his entire body of work. The value of the reward might be $5, or $10 or, if I&#8217;m wealthy, $100 or even $1000. The important thing is that I get to send the reward directly to the creator, and I get to show off that I&#8217;ve done so.Here in specific terms are the four things the service should allow me to do&#8230; Make a &#8216;payment&#8217; in whatever form suits the creator: through a Paypal transaction, by buying something from their Amazon wishlist, by donating to their favourite charity &#8211; even by paying off their bar tab at their local pub. It&#8217;s up to them. The more creative the better, actually. I&#8217;d love the idea of rewarding a starving artist through Pizza Hut gift certificates, if that&#8217;s what they want. Display the payment publicly. I want to Tweet that I&#8217;ve made the payment, or add it to Blippy &#8211; or whatever. But more importantly, I want my payment to appear on the artist&#8217;s website, along with my name. That way, I feel like my fan-dom is being acknowledged both by the artist and by other fans. What would be super cool would be if the artist figured out some other way to reach out to fans who support them: maybe people who donate over a certain amount get a DVD/signed book/print/whatever. But, again, that&#8217;s up to them. Allow me to reward the artist directly. No bullshit 10% commissions like Flattr charges. I&#8217;m a fan of David Renwick, so it&#8217;s him who should get the money, not the dude who created Pirate Bay &#8211; he&#8217;s made more than enough hay from other people&#8217;s creativity. Reward artists who aren&#8217;t signed up to the service. This is the big one. For a system to work, users have to be able to use it to reward anyone. That&#8217;s one of the things that made Paypal so successful. All you need to do to pay someone using Paypal is to enter their email address. If they don&#8217;t have a Paypal account, they receive an email inviting them to sign up to receive the money &#8211; which of course, due to the financial incentive &#8211; they do. This service should be the same. If the artist I want to reward isn&#8217;t registered on the service, I should be able to enter their email address and have the service contact them, asking them to choose how they&#8217;d like to be rewarded. When they&#8217;ve done that, I get an automated email with a payment link and am able to send the reward via whatever method they&#8217;ve chosen. Obviously once they&#8217;re signed up, future payments can be processed straight away. And if I don&#8217;t know the email address for a particular creator? No problem &#8211; I can enter their publisher, record label, newspaper or whoever else distributes their work and the site will figure out the correct contact email. Publishers forward mail to their authors all the time.&#8230;and that&#8217;s it. As a &#8216;consumer&#8217; (urk) of content, I want that service to exist so that I can start rewarding people using it. As a writer, I want that service to exist so that I can add myself to it and display a little logo on my site that links to my listing. That way, next time someone feels the urge to reward me, they can do so without having to ask first.So what to do with this idea? If I were an entrepreneur, the answer to that would be simple. I&#8217;d figure out the specifics of how such a service might work, and then I&#8217;d build it. Or at least hire someone to build it. I&#8217;d set up a company either raise some seed money or boot-strap the thing myself. I&#8217;d do market research and figure out business models and all that stuff. I&#8217;d probably give it a name like Guiltvault or Micropatron (both gone). Maybe it would work, maybe it wouldn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the fun of being an entrepreneur.But I&#8217;m not an entrepreneur. Moreover, I&#8217;ve been one &#8211; several times &#8211; and I&#8217;ve sworn never to go back to that world. Also, there&#8217;s a part of me that thinks this idea could work best as a non-profit. Or even perhaps as a kind of open standard thing. Certainly with all the rewards going directly to the creators, no one else is going to get rich out of it &#8211; which might actually be the secret to getting publishers, agents and trade bodies on board with it.So instead of drawing up an NDA and building a business, I&#8217;ve decided to do the opposite: to release the idea into the wild in the in the hope that someone &#8211; or some group of people &#8211; might want to run with it. For once, I&#8217;m actually encouraging the wisdom of TechCrunch commenters: I&#8217;m curious to know how you see the idea working, or why you see it failing. And if anyone with a history of making things actually happen feels like having a crack at building this, then you have my blessing. I&#8217;d be delighted to track your progress here on TechCrunch.For my part, I&#8217;ve vowed to stay out of business &#8211; and it&#8217;s a vow I plan on sticking to. But if I can be of any help connecting people or throwing ideas into the ring, then give me a shout. Either way, I&#8217;ll be the first author to sign up to use it.And, hell, if you make a billion dollars from the idea, at least you&#8217;ll know how to reward me for my contribution.',\n",

While Facebook and Twitter drive more sharing than any other services, Google is trying to compete with Buzz, which is now part of Gmail but shares links to article and blog posts through Google Reader. Over the past month, according to AddThis, sharing through Google Reader is up 35 percent, with a big jump on February 9, the dayÂ\\xa0Buzz launched. Â\\xa0This number only measures sharing through the AddThis button, which is on more than 600,000 Websites and gives you the option to share content through more than 200 services. So it is only a proxy for total sharing on Google Reader, but a decent one.Google Reader still barely registers when compared to Twitter and Facebook, which account for 31 percent and 8 percent of all sharing via AddThis, respectively. Â\\xa0But Buzz is definitely giving it a boost.You can now chart how different services do against each other on the sharing front via a new services directory on AddThis. For instance, Google Bookmarks does much better than Google Reader, with 5 percent of all AddThis activity. Â\\xa0It even beats Digg (which has 3 percent). Â\\xa0Google Bookmarks is probably used more for personal bookmarking than for social consumption, but it is smack in the middle of Twitter and Digg when it comes to activity via AddThis.Another comparison is Tumblr versus Posterous, which suggests that Tumblr Â\\xa0is much more popular as a reposting tool, and is about neck-and-neck with WordPress.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Your startup toils away for months on a new product or feature and &#8211; boom &#8211; a giant like Google comes along and walks all over it.That appears to be the case for Dublin-based music video site, Muzu TV (see previous TCEU coverage), which today launched its new music video jukebox feature. A sort of Spotify-for-video, it&#8217;s not too dissimilar from Google-owned YouTube&#8217;s recent disco beta or &#8216;Music Discovery Project and Playlist Creation Tool&#8217; to give it its full name.The Muzu video jukebox offers up a search box in which users can type in an artist or track name, and instantly create music video playlists based on the results. Playlists can be edited and re-ordered in real-time, without interrupting the music, and there&#8217;s related artist recommendations built-in too, providing an element of discovery.A side by side comparison with YouTube&#8217;s disco, shows an almost identical feature-set. Although, in typical Google fashion, YouTube&#8217;s version is much more minimalistic in design and I actually prefer the look &#8216;n&#8217; feel and overall UX of Muzu TV&#8217;s jukebox.But at the end of the day, marketing aside, it will probably come down to the content or the size of each site&#8217;s music video catalogue.Muzu.TV predominantly targets the UK and Ireland and has around 100,000 videos on the site, although not all of these are &#8216;music videos&#8217; but include concert archive footage and interviews etc. The startup also has local deals with all four majors and a whole bunch of Indies, such as Beggars, Domino, PIAS, Cooking Vinyl and Merlin.Muzu thinks it&#8217;s onto something by avoiding the intrusion of pre-roll advertising. While the site is ad-supported, it&#8217;s leveraging alternative ad formats such as â\\x80\\x98skinningâ\\x80\\x99 the outside of the video player with branded content, so as to not interrupt the viewing experience.CrunchBase Information',\n",

ChaCha.com visitors can access the local business listings in a search bar and through a direct listings page. In both cases, they will be served a full content page that includes Google maps, directions, phone, and other contact information.

Eventually, ChaCha&#8217;s listings will be integrated with its chachacoupons.com site. The local business listings feature makes sense, as ChaCha realizes the importance of local content for both its mobile application and website. Localeze also helps power local business listings for Microsoft Bing&#8217;s Bing Local and Bing 411.

       "  'comments_content': 'Passlogix, an enterprise software company focused on simplifying access to company resources, is announcing an authentication product which will allow users to log on to Windows with any type of identification device&#8211;including national ID badges, access cards, one-time password tokens, and biometrics. The product, v-GO Universal Authentication Manager, utilizes the customers&#8217; existing infrastructure while also leveraging corporate directories, thus lowering the total cost of ownership from an average of $150 per user to $15.Passlogix aims to be the last strong authentication product that companies will need to buy as their product can evolve based on their customers&#8217; needs. They hope to achieve this goal by providing an open architecture whereby any device from a multitude of manufacturers can be used for Windows login, rather than forcing a company to choose a singular method which is often times proprietary. By employing this type of architecture, clients are able to move to a new authentication vendor, use physical access devices already being utilized for other purposes, and use multiple types of authentication methods across a company&#8217;s network. For example, a company could use pre-existing building access cards (which only allow entrance to those who work in that building) to log in at one branch, while others from the same company, but at a different office, can use a completely different proprietary access card to log in from their location. Similarly, those in the second branch could use an entirely different mode of authentication, such as biometrics, to securely log in. This feature is especially useful for companies who have varying levels of access privileges.By allowing organizations to use authentication devices which are already deployed, Passlogix removes the need for additional investment in secure Windows logon. Those who use this product will never have to remember their password again, as it is stored on the authentication device. Furthermore, dedicated servers typically needed for secure network access are not needed, which again lowers the total cost of ownership, and brings down any potential scalability barriers.Strong authentication solutions for Windows are also more secure than the use of a password, which can be compromised in any number of ways, as physical access of the authenticator is needed. If an employee loses, or his means of authentication is stolen, Passlogix can remotely shut off the authenticator, thus blocking access to any files or information on an organization&#8217;s network. Additionally, they can report on the use of access of the authenticator to see what, if anything, has been jeopardized.Passlogix is in a unique situation given that most of their competitors are also those whose products they support. Companies such as HID Global and DigitalPersona provide strong authentication tools which can be integrated into Passlogix&#8217; infrastructure.v-GO Universal Authentication Manager is priced at $15 per user and carries a yearly 20 percent fee for support and maintenance.Passlogix was founded in 1996 and has raised approximately $20 million in venture capital. Their latest round of funding was for $11.5 million in 2002 and was led by Hanseatic Americas. The company has sold 21M user licenses of their various products in 140 countries.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Yep, it&#8217;s yet another Groupon clone.Only this time, Groupola.com is already making claims to be the biggest group buying site in the country. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s launching simultaneously in 8 of the largest cities across the UK, including London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff and Edinburgh.This makes it immediately standout from rivals such as Berlin-based MyCityDeal and Groupon itself, both of which have a UK reach currently limited to London.More noteworthy is Groupola&#8217;s founder, Mark Pearson, who has a pretty good track record of offering consumers the best deals and making money on top, having founded MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, the leading discount voucher site in the UK.For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with the group buying model, here&#8217;s how Groupola.com works:Each day, the site will feature a deal in each of the eight cities it is launching in. Then if enough people commit, the company offering it will honour the deal, which will be anything from 50-90% off the full price. If not enough people sign up to that particular deal, the offer is withdrawn and no money passes hands.Examples include, savings at restaurants, spa days, beauty and hairdressing, experience days, sport and leisure activities, theatre tickets,  and concerts.Along with daily deals, Groupola also appears to have weekly offers too, with a longer window for group buyers. Virgin Balloon Flights is the current partner, offering 50% off a four hour hot-air balloon experience if more than 25 people sign-up. It will cost Â£149 and includes a copy of Sir Richard Bransonâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Losing My Virginityâ\\x80\\x99 autobiography.

At the same time the European Union is investigating a pretty flimsy anti-trust complaint against Google, it&#8217;s conspiciously ignoring a case in Italy where three Google executives have been found guilty on a ridiculous charge. Here is the bizarre story.An Italian court yesterday convicted two current and one former Google exec in a trial over a video showing a teenager being bullied. The Google Italy employees were accused of breaking Italian law by allowing the video of bullying of a teenager with autism to be posted on YouTube Google Video in late 2006. Despite the fact that Google removed the video within hours of being notified of its existence, Judge Oscar Magi (pictured) absolved the three of defamation but convicted them of privacy violations. The three executives have received a suspended six-month sentence, while a fourth defendant was acquitted. Google is appealing the sentences on their behalf.Google has responded in a justifiably vociferous blog post calling this a &#8220;serious threat to the web in Italy&#8221;. Frankly they are right.As Google explains:In late 2006 Students at a school in Turin, Italy filmed and then uploaded a video to Google Video that showed them bullying an autistic schoolmate. The video was totally reprehensible and we took it down within hours of being notified by the Italian police. We also worked with the local police to help identify the person responsible for uploading it and she was subsequently sentenced to 10 months community service by a court in Turin, as were several other classmates who were also involved. In these rare but unpleasant cases, that&#8217;s where our involvement would normally end.However, a public prosecutor in Milan decided to indict the four Google employees â\\x80\\x94David Drummond, Arvind Desikan, Peter Fleischer and George Reyes. These guys left the company in 2008.The charges were for criminal defamation and a failure to comply with the Italian privacy code. Now, why did someone not explain to this idiot judge that the video was NOT uploaded by these Google executives?Hello?Now Drummond, Fleischer and Reyes have been convicted.In other words an Italian court has found that employees of an internet company are criminally responsible for content that users upload. The court is ignoring existing European law which gives hosting providers a safe harbor from liability so long as they remove illegal content once they are notified of its existence.It&#8217;s at this point one wonders if we should just give up on Italy as ever getting the Internet.Google is appealing the decision, obviously.Look, Italy needs to get its act together and fast. I&#8217;m calling on Italian entreprenuers, many of whom I know and respect to get involved in this issue. At a time when European countries are weighed down by regulation and stupid rulings like this one, especially during a period of huge economic upheaval, it is not enough to stand by and watch travesties like this go by.Do the young people of Italy and the rest of Europe, so many of whom are huge enthusiasts of the Web and the power it gives them to drag themselves up by their bootraps without the need for state help, deserve to have decrepit judges decide their economic future?I think not.UPDATE: As commenters note below, the Judge in question is on Facebook, so he presumably knows what user generated content is. In which case why this bizarre judgement?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Former CEO of CBS Interactive Quincy Smith has joined with CBS Interactive EVP Michael Marquez and music industry veteran dealmaker Fred Davis to launch CODE Advisors, a new Silicon Valley and New York based investment bank.As with all investment banks, CODE Advisors will look to advise companies on mergers and acquisitions and capital raising, for a fee. But the company also wants to be a long term partner for buyers and sellers, acting as a sort of outsourced business and corporate development group. This is something most banks promise, but few deliver on. Unless you&#8217;re a high velocity buyer like Google or Microsoft, in which case you get all the attention you want and more.And these guys are certainly positioned to do that. Smith, Marquez and Davis are among the most connected people in the media and technology worlds. Smith and Marquez spearheaded the growth of CBS Interactive and its acquisitions of CNET and Last.fm, both of which are seen as successful buys, and both have deep experience in those industries. Davis, a former music exec, is known for representing just about every online music venture over the last several years. When startups want to do business with labels and the other players in music, they go to Davis. These guys literally know everybody. And they are also opinionated on which exactly what the world will look like when the old media and new media worlds finally collide. I sat down with the three partners on Tuesday for what I expected to be a 5-minute interview on the launch of CODE Advisors. When we were done, we had well over thirty minutes of footage. The conversation was mostly hovering around the future of online video and online music.CODE Advisors already has several clients, including CBS, Comcast and Spotify (which was in the news yesterday).We&#8217;ll have a full transcript of the video up later today, but the video is below.

Want to &#8211; we&#8217;ll have a post on this as well, but I want to hear you guys talk about the bank and what you guys were up to do and accomplish in, you know, the next couple of years. Mr. SMITH: So the brief history of the bank and we, I think recognize that starting a bank isn&#8217;t necessarily most usual thing in the world, so thank you for your time on doing it. But the brief history of banking is, you know, about 20 years ago, when you and I were out there and lucky to be enough around companies like Netscape. There was, you know&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Twenty years ago I was in college.Mr. SMITH: Now you need five.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yup. When you were in Netscape, when you were in Netscape.Mr. SMITH: Do math. Thirteen, 15 years ago.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. SMITH: Can&#8217;t start as bankers.Mr. ARRINGTON: Not that it&#8217;s really important.Mr. SMITH: It&#8217;s more about the positioning of the numbers than the numbers themselves. So when we&#8217;re lucky enough to be in and around that company, you know, there was a bank called Hambrecht and Quist that was extremely good at what it did and that it was helpful for advise in and around transactions and often some of the best that it ever did never materialized in some sort of a fee around the transactions that got done with services, just some of the advise on a pile of other things. H and Q wasn&#8217;t alone, Robertson Stevens, Alex Brown, Montgomery that were known as the four horsemen if you read Wikipedia and that was in a time when there was clearly far less technology innovation and less need for media to come up and talk technology. We argued that now there&#8217;s &#8211; we already know it as a fact. There&#8217;s more technology in the nation going on today more than ever and there&#8217;s more of a need for me to speak technology to the extent that it represents multiple platforms, multiple ways to get paid for your content. And yet, there are fewer banks that have concerted efforts in the new media technology space. So we&#8217;re just hoping to be able to be one of those players.Mr. ARRINGTON: Will you talk a little bit about your backgrounds? It&#8217;s pretty varied so &#8211; Fred?Mr. FRED DAVIS: It&#8217;s actually coming from law in which it&#8217;s unusual to be going into banking but the recent history is working with a lot of additional media companies. We&#8217;re trying to figure out how to monetize content on the web. We&#8217;re kind of majoring in music and minor in video. And&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Is there any one you didn&#8217;t represent? Excuse me, quires included, you know, Google?Mr. DAVIS: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah, My Space, of course.Mr. DAVIS: Correct.Mr. ARRINGTON: You Tube.Mr. DAVIS: Imeem.Mr. ARRINGTON: Imeem.Mr. DAVIS: Ilike.Mr. ARRINGTON: Ilike.Mr. DAVIS: Last FM, Spotify&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Everyone.Mr. DAVIS: We do not represent Pandora. Do not represent Lala. That&#8217;s easier to answer.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. OK.Mr. DAVIS: That way, yeah, for various music, but yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah. But you know all the labels intimately and&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Sure.Mr. ARRINGTON: You&#8217;ve worked with the start ups &#8211; help.Mr. DAVIS: We&#8217;ve never worked &#8211; we&#8217;ve never represented the labels, always represented the media companies trying to figure out ways and build business models to monetize music and that&#8217;s whether it was early downloads or subscriptions or free, you know, free ad supports, streaming, whatever the new models are, we focus on that.Mr. ARRINGTON: Any of those work?Mr. DAVIS: They&#8217;re all going to work.Mr. ARRINGTON: Really?Mr. DAVIS: Real question is&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON:  Even free &#8211; free aid streaming&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Free&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: My Space music current model, current one.Mr. DAVIS: Free is not a dirty word in music. There&#8217;s always been free with music, it was called radio. Unlimited interactive free is the dirty job to play with. So we have to find out the right balance between limited free and monetization and that&#8217;s a balance &#8211; we&#8217;re not going to go overnight. It&#8217;s going to take a little time.Mr. ARRINGTON: Luckily we saw a bit for it, right? So, unlimited free our demand needs. So&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: In the video space we talked about who were with you &#8211; added as well, just you represented broad and YouTube. So&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Yeah, you&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: YouTube before the acquisition?Mr. DAVIS: YouTube before the acquisition.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: YouTube through  the creation of VIVO.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And YouTube now and really focusing on the music video area. But &#8211; but, yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: So with this great law practice, why in the world would you &#8211; you and your law firm, why would you stop to join these guys?Mr. DAVIS: It&#8217;s a good question. Mr. SMITH: He thinks money would say.Mr. DAVIS: That&#8217;s a good question. No because evolving into the space, what I saw is having the intimate relationships with the companies.Mr. ARRINGTON: Mm hmm.Mr. DAVIS: And I saw all the transactions that were going around with VIVO than I worked with &#8211; with Imeem, with Ilike and the bankers were quite frankly getting the business that I should have been getting.Mr. ARRINGTON: Well, be frank. I mean, not been for a while. People were coming to you for legal advise all the time. Most of the time, they&#8217;re coming to you for business advice. The same advice you&#8217;re going to be giving them at Code Advisors.Mr. DAVIS: Correct, right. These are very natural &#8211; logical evolution would be to play the banker role and&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Correct. Michael?Mr. MICHAEL MARQUEZ: So, my background, I started out as a computer programmer with Anderson Consulting and their center of excellence. Did that for several years and then went into banking at Robertson Stevens and so that&#8217;s kind of where a lot of history is &#8211; when Quincy referenced as well with Hambrecht and Quist. Same way that Robertson Stevens was really kind of getting back to the heart of relationship banking. And then from there, spent the last portion of my career in corporate development. First with Yahoo and then as head corporate development business fieldman at CBS.Mr. ARRINGTON: What was it &#8211; the companies you brought at Yahoo? Well, you formed that project fraternity, the billion dollar acquisition of Facebook. You topped it.Mr. MARQUEZ: I can&#8217;t speak to the specific ones that we didn&#8217;t do. But I can definitely talk about the ones that we did do. So adpost, Fair Chase, Delicious, (unintelligible), these were some of the acquisitions that I did.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. Great. Quincy?Mr. SMITH: I started at Morgan Stanley. I joined Netscape. Then started The Barksdale Group, then Barksdale Bureau carried Dan Robert and joined Allen Company and then joined CBS for three years and the reason I left in January but never really left as CBS is our first client.Mr. ARRINGTON: You actually &#8211; you&#8217;re &#8211; all those years at Netscape, where I was actually your attorney.Mr. SMITH: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Junior attorney and you&#8217;re in corp of &#8211; all those years, you just served some of these, Netscape. I mean, those were some trying, dramatic years.Mr. SMITH: I was, by the way, Jay, so you want more coloring, yeah, it was hard, man. I mean, the Netscape experience was an unbelievable thing. And I just &#8211; sort of schizophrenic job that I don&#8217;t think is wiggle anymore. We had corporate development as you point out.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. SMITH: But also investor relations. So mainly it meant working for Peter Currie.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And it was awesome. We did 16 transactions. We did nine joint ventures. We did a pile of investments and it was a whirlwind time with a great group of people. So yeah, no, there&#8217;s &#8211; I mean, the Netscape experience was an unbelievable &#8211; and so they &#8211; well, we decided to start the Mercer group&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.MR. SMITH: And then move from there.Mr. ARRINGTON: So, it&#8217;s all right. Quincy and Mike, the time you spent at CBS, you bought CNET, right? Was that first acquisition you did for&#8230;Mr. SMITH: Last FM.Mr. ARRINGTON: Last FM.Mr. SMITH: And Wall Script.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK.Mr. SMITH: And CNET.Mr. ARRINGTON: Wallstrip.. Mr. SMITH: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. So Last.fm then CNET. How do you feel about those acquisitions? How they&#8217;ve done since you acquired them? Do you think that was a right strategy for CBS? How did it go?Mr. SMITH: Yeah. So at that time, CBS, in the split from Viacom, didn&#8217;t have a huge online presence. It did have SportsLine. And the thing that we learned about SportsLine, it ranked (unintelligible) about 140th worldwide units(ph) per month overall its property. SportsLine was amazing because of its fantasy sports. We talked about this before. The beauty of fantasy sports is it shows the web as a new medium, people play from Tuesday through the following Thursday. And on Sunday, they&#8217;re more than excited to watch the football game in a regular flat screen television environment. So we thought about what&#8217;s the fantasy of music, and Last.fm very much fit in that category from our perspective. It was discovery, it was as much as about streaming stuff, it&#8217;s about learning more and things that are added to the existing medium. Plus, it had a great international footprint. CBS, I have to say, 90 percent (unintelligible) diversify outside. And then CNET. What we always thought about CNET was CNET was only bigger than CNET Networks, which is to say, CNET but was also BNET, GameSpot and all kinds of other things. Plus, it had a really good team, an adult team. They talk about how to make money on the web in categories that CBS understood. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. SMITH: So I&#8217;d say overall â\\x80\\x93 and CBS just reported last Thursday, the interactive group has always been a strong group in there. What we think about first inside the CBS when talking about the internet is how the web can be added as opposed to how we&#8217;re regurgitating our television shows online all the time.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah. All right. So let&#8217;s talk now about CODE Advisors. So you guys are differentiating yourselves from other banks out there. You&#8217;re not just focusing on jumping in, help remote transaction getting your feed. So you want to be a real long-term partner of these companies. When you look back, some of the banks (unintelligible) Robert and Stevens from the &#8217;90s in particular. We worked with (unintelligible) and certainly, I think they were developing those kinds of relationships. But is it realistic today the service â\\x80\\x93 I assume that you can do that talking about some of your clients and how you&#8217;re working with them already and things like that. Mr. SMITH: Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question.Mr. ARRINGTON: Do your clients say I want this kind of, you know, sort of long-term relationship with you? Are they embracing you how you want to be embraced?Mr. SMITH: That&#8217;s the hope so far and keep in mind, we&#8217;re startups. So it&#8217;s hard to tell, you know, early on out of the box to get a (unintelligible) from a company like CBS on the (unintelligible), you know, companies. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m going to ask Fred to talk about modifying our relationship there.Mr. ARRINGTON: Those are the two early clients here disclosing now.Mr. SMITH: Yeah. So we do think there&#8217;s a need. We think there&#8217;s more need than ever for doing it and  we think it&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re expanding the role of investment bank. We think banks are doing a great job today. We think transactions are hitting up. You know, whether the public markets with the lights have an open table, the unbelievable thing with Jeff Jordan is he will do it again and again, quarter by quarter to the transaction side of all the deals that have gone down the last (unintelligible) to the other transaction side and then we really productively and (unintelligible) both secondary markets as well as (unintelligible) and more innovation than ever, as you always point out. The role of the sort of second, third generation entrepreneurs, their CEO guys are going bad. They&#8217;ve been through this before, that kind of experiences make them so much more able. But we think there&#8217;s an opportunity to kind of expand the role of investment bank. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad word. We&#8217;re (unintelligible) bankers, and we&#8217;ve been in a position where we think we can offer things like business development help, content rights help, help find board members, and be with companies all over the world.Mr. ARRINGTON: You don&#8217;t charge that, right? You still charge just for&#8230;Mr. SMITH: Usually, you get paid by a transaction. Now, you know based on your background (unintelligible) that, you know, there&#8217;s a whole process that has to go through with this first. You have to file (unintelligible), you have to make sure you get SEC approvals. In the meantime, by the way, we are pay backing the broker-dealer license of the Great Hammer(ph) so that we are (unintelligible) which, you know, more like we build a lightning rod for entrepreneurs in the community and always super smart on it. We also think working with him is additive and that he cares more about the capital markets for now and the internal&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Plus, he has a license.Mr. SMITH: Plus, he has a license. Plus â\\x80\\x93 yeah. But you know, we&#8217;re actively working with them trying to identify if we can do it together.Mr. ARRINGTON: And you get paid for transactions. Are you going to try to get paid for other things as well in these relationships or&#8230;Mr. SMITH: Well, ultimately, we hope that over the next nine months, 12 months, God willing, we get full approval by (unintelligible) to make sure that we have our own licenses to interact.Mr. ARRINGTON: Your billing model is â\\x80\\x93 your fee model is exactly the same as any bank. It&#8217;s transaction-based.Mr. SMITH: It&#8217;s transaction-based. I&#8217;ll make (unintelligible) and I was lucky enough to understand this and get this (unintelligible).There is an engagement type of relationship you can have with some of the larger companies when I was at â\\x80\\x93 out in a company I had. That was CBS and I also had it with Comcast. And those are the kinds of things we looked to emulate where you&#8217;re not working with them on transactions, but you are overall helping them understand strategically where they want to be in this space. Mr. ARRINGTON: Are you already running a new conflict of interest where you&#8217;re working with one company, you just can&#8217;t work with someone else? It must be something you&#8217;re running into. Or can you represent both sides?Mr. DAVIS: Well, representing both sides in conflict (unintelligible). I don&#8217;t feel that we are (unintelligible). Do you feel that we are at all? I don&#8217;t think that we are yet. Mr. MARQUEZ: I don&#8217;t think that we are either. I think that&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yes, you&#8217;re representing the (unintelligible).Mr. SMITH: Chances are good. Yes, (unintelligible). There are probably some other relationships with larger banks. They&#8217;re ultimately used to do the actual transactions.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK.Mr. SMITH: So maybe there&#8217;s a chance to jump to the other side (unintelligible). You know, we are super sensitive about it, so I&#8217;d say we (unintelligible) more defensively there. And if we do think they&#8217;re conflict, we probably can&#8217;t work with them. But it is really â\\x80\\x93 as Fred say&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah. I wasn&#8217;t really trying to dig into that. It&#8217;s more of just â\\x80\\x93 seems like (unintelligible) the side and that&#8217;s maybe â\\x80\\x93 I was modifying and your two first clients here announcing you seem to be on both the (unintelligible) side. I was wondering&#8230;Mr. SMITH: It&#8217;s a great â\\x80\\x93 in an ideal world, and I don&#8217;t know who (unintelligible) this expression it was not â\\x80\\x93 but we want to be bankers for the deal and I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s coined this expression or whatnot, but we want to be bankers for the deal. We&#8217;re out there because we really believe in it. The deals that we&#8217;ve done in the past or point to like advertising.com data. Well, we did it because we thought it was the right thing for the environment. Not this even better for a relative individual and better for r.com, it was better for the users and better for the other outer world.Mr. ARRINGTON: What, you are part of that deal?Mr. SMITH: Yeah, we hope to settle our dot com to tell you and house it when I was at the Allen Company.Mr. ARRINGTON: Okay, great.Mr. SMITH: And part of it &#8211; and also, it&#8217;s coming of the idea, making it real &#8211; that the&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. SMITH: Connecting the right people. Making it the right presentation and speak the right language on both sides, can even understand why they should be acquiring or be acquired. The technical actual deal part is a separate part of it that necessarily we don&#8217;t have to do what we can do. Mr. DAVIS: But a lot of the work is done with the idea that any introductions and that we can do with both sides. Mr. SMITH: But there&#8217;s a real need to not just understand the technology and how the services work but to explain them to people who don&#8217;t think about it as much day to day.Mr. ARRINGTON: Do a lot of translated between the two cultures and the two industries. It&#8217;s a lot of the special source that we have. You have to feel&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: It&#8217;s a lot of this special sauce that we have and that&#8217;s &#8211; you have to feel that. You can&#8217;t &#8211; you know, you can&#8217;t learn that.Mr. SMITH: There&#8217;s no way we can credibly explain how we do that on the film without looking like it is. Mr. SMITH: Well, we&#8217;re raise down and prove it.Mr. ARRINGTON: You guys talk about being a startup, you get your raised capital or initial capital. Do you have investors?Mr. SMITH: So, as you know, the advisory business is a strong and profitable business if done right, so you don&#8217;t need to require to raise a pile. We have no plans to raise a fund to the extent that we do have friends that want to be supportive of us. We know we might try taking some existing capital but it wouldn&#8217;t be material for the most part&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Friends and family we work at. Mr. SMITH: Yeah, we&#8217;re up and running with nothing there.Mr. ARRINGTON: And what about all these legal partners?Mr. SMITH: Oh, this got to be start up. I mean, Marquez has his Amex Black Card. We&#8217;re in the business of making sure weâ\\x80\\x99ve black coaching(ph) and we&#8217;ll see it all the time. Mr. ARRINGTON: With the black card youâ\\x80\\x99re referring to the American Express black card that Mike currently has so&#8230; Mr. DAVIS: (Unintelligible)Mr. ARRINGTON: I didn&#8217;t bring it upâ\\x80¦Mr. MARQUEZ:  Nothing else to see right now.Mr. DAVIS: This is first class.Mr. ARRINGTON: Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to talk a little bit about the way you guys think about the future of media online. And I&#8217;m offline.Mr. DAVIS: I would like to talk about that.Mr. ARRINGTON: And that seems to be the area we&#8217;re really focusing on which makes sense to me but I love the idea. We&#8217;ll start &#8211; let&#8217;s start with video I guess and &#8211; let&#8217;s start with music I think just because of &#8211; besides the fact that you know and represented every single person in the music industry online and then know everybody offline as well. But putting all the sides of the people you know in the company to support. What you actually think is going to happen with music, you know, online and how these guys on labels in particular are going to make money in the future. Well, yeah.Mr. DAVIS: So, that&#8217;s you know the $64,000 question. Mr. ARRINGTON: And just give me your answer like 10 seconds or less.Mr. SMITH: As in terms of the heat.Mr. DAVIS. Is &#8211; it&#8217;s the monetization that will lead that ownership or access, that&#8217;s the heart of the issue and you have like very successful companies, iTunes, Amazon and Top Spin and you know, (unintelligible) store and real network store that you are focusing on ownership but that&#8217;s access. And then yeah, that&#8217;s why you get companies that dealing with access to free exports streaming into subscription.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And that&#8217;s why you have this monetize with the world, into my spaces of the world and the mobs(ph) and the &#8211; the new &#8211; all the new breed of companies coming up and it&#8217;s got that music everywhere.Mr. ARRINGTON: And you think access is the future of music everywhere?Mr. DAVIS: Music everywhere because&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Not storing songs on your hard drive and buying them likeâ\\x80¦Mr. DAVIS: As long as you can have access to it everywhere, it &#8211; both can exist. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: You know, the MP3 doesn&#8217;t have to be a transitory technology that as long as you can get your music everywhere is what the consumer is going to be thanked for. And right now, you can&#8217;t. Books would be a lot less valuable if you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t take them out of your home. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah. And what will consumers pay for access? I mean, given that there&#8217;s free options, although in legal, there&#8217;s always a radio. There seems like Pandora, but what will they pay for, what do you think?Mr. DAVIS: I think there&#8217;s &#8211; there was one solution at the old school modem which was a CD. It doesn&#8217;t have to be one solution here. It could be different demographics theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to want different things. Some of the older generation will still want own â\\x80\\x93 some it could do with our generation well, just want to be able to put it on their iPhone.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And you don&#8217;t have to have a one sub solution will it be bundled into your eyes being at your home, or it will be bundled into your wireless service provider on your phone, will it be through apps, will â\\x80\\x93 we don&#8217;t have to have one solution. Mr. ARRINGTON: But seems like people who are to pay for mobile access in particular&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: That&#8217;s the first thing&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: But are likely to be showing&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: The people wouldn&#8217;t pay that premium as a 12 or 10 year fee for &#8211; particularly for the mobile access.Mr. DAVIS: That is one say that Spotify is showing with real time data into Europe right now. And that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so much excitement here about our company, you know.Mr. ARRINGTON: What do you think is the right &#8211; what do you think, there&#8217;s a right fee for user to promote the premiere to have access to any you know, any recorded song ever on the phone, online, whatever you need &#8211; people pay $60 a year, $100 a year, what do you think is sort of a &#8211; the right point that are&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: You know, I&#8217;m biased because I still don&#8217;t, you know, have &#8211; remember growing up and think that, you know, Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton, you know, are very valuable.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And it&#8217;s very difficult for the content of these to look at the history of word music only being worth $2 or $3 a month.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yes.Mr. DAVIS: Very tough. And it, you know, maybe it&#8217;s going to be channeled. Maybe you&#8217;re going to be able to buy rock music for a certain price and country music for a different price. Everybody only keep thinking it&#8217;s a one price fits all model. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: It doesn&#8217;t have to be that way and maybe it has one value at home and one value that&#8217;s mobile and you can window it, you can &#8211; you put it first stages of these.Mr. ARRINGTON: Have the labels ever looked at the Archos (ph) of the user back at they hay day with the &#8211; it was, you know, it&#8217;s in 1995.Mr. DAVIS: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Did they ever say, an average user of music say in their 20s.Mr. DAVIS: Yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: They&#8217;re going to spend this much a year on concerts and CD&#8217;s. Was that ever done? I mean &#8211; and what was that number?Mr. DAVIS: Well, there was a &#8211; there was the number that was only now, we&#8217;re looking at our back&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: In the 80&#8217;s they were in big, you know&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Just you don&#8217;t &#8211; they&#8217;re not selling you &#8211; yeah.Mr. DAVIS: It was just about selling. They never really analyzed how much free did you give away the sale. In the hay that you sold a million copies, but a hundred million people probably heard the song.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: All the waste that they &#8211; will &#8211; think about that. But you also had to buy 10 songs to get one.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yup.Mr. DAVIS: And it was that it was an artificial model.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: We&#8217;re back to the old days where you could buy tracks. The Beatles first came out as a single band. It&#8217;s a single&#8217;s band. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yup.Mr. DAVIS:  Only later that the album start taking over what the singles were. But now they are looking at arpool and now it&#8217;s an artificial analysis because of &#8211; the balance is all over them.Mr. ARRINGTON: Is there &#8211; what was it &#8211; what year the date with the labels. What year did they make the most money?Mr. DAVIS: 2001.Mr. ARRINGTON: 2001. What was the revenue, gross revenue then&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: I don&#8217;t know that at all. Depending &#8211; they sold &#8211; in America, either about 750 million CDs sold.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And now we&#8217;re about 3 8 &#8211; 380 million. It&#8217;s dramatically down from the U.S. sales of CDs.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: That does include all the iTunes tracks and the ring tones and the subscription business. Somebody has (unintelligible) as bleak financially is that. But you could see what the decline of the CD.Mr. ARRINGTON: Do you think the music industry has made good choices with the benefit of right side over the last decade now or it&#8217;s your forced them at that or&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: I think the music industry has made a series of mistakes only and it&#8217;s&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Based on being morons or based on just faced with what they were facing they made the right choices at the right time and it turned out to be the wrong choices?Mr. DAVIS: No. There is, you know, it &#8211; you can&#8217;t be &#8211; with the trade, difficult to be judge and jury because&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: You know, they have&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: I thought it&#8217;s extremely easy to&#8230;Mr. DAVIS: Yeah. I understand. But you know, there&#8217;s &#8211; there&#8217;s a consortium &#8211; they have a partnership with the artist that sometimes we don&#8217;t appreciate.Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: And they have investments that they make and create in the music that we all love, and there are publishers that we practically know who have been song writers and producers in this entire eco system that sometime out here on the West Coast people forget about that the investment. Think of all the songwriters now who don&#8217;t benefit with the same way that they did to sell the CDs with the producers. That&#8217;s the affair.Mr. ARRINGTON: Right. Mr. DAVIS: It&#8217;s (unintelligible) with the directors and the screenwriters in the movies. Sometime we seem to appreciate their value in the ecosystem or so you know, their sympathetics &#8211; but they would never &#8211; the music industry was brought up learning how about to make records not how to distribute them. Nobody have the expertise and we&#8217;ve been very critical then to think that they&#8217;re going to learn this muscle overnight given the graphic changes that are going on. So, they had to make a lot of right choices there. And there (unintelligible) a few correct choices but at least they (unintelligible) and we have to give them credit for that. Mr. ARRINGTON: Quincy we talked about your views on video and where it is going on online, and also the fact that the average that the offline guys are able to get though there is no real correlation to online where it was once reporting and the people are paying in different ways and offline they&#8217;re still paying in the old way and &#8211; how does it all come together? Does the offline reach the day (unintelligible) on it? As speak with off line or are you able to maybe add more value online and get better rates? Mr. SMITH: Yeah, so these are all good questions as you said. We do talk about these ones a lot. Itâ\\x80\\x99s something weâ\\x80\\x99ve spent a lot of time on hopefully it can be part of the thesis going forward .  By the way, as a segway you know, I like (unintelligible) but these are the kind of thing we&#8217;re trying about for Code Advisors. We have to have points of view. In the old days you had bankers and you had research guys, research guys who generally with the best bankers in the planet &#8217;cause they thought about a lot of bankers (unintelligible) going in for the business and I spoke if they were. In this particular case, the bakers in particular the bankers need to know what they are doing. So, you have to have them and we have to think about and we have to create thesis around that (unintelligible) in which way we&#8217;re going to go. So, the long winded way to segway to video. First thing is different from using &#8211; two minutes of CSI is (unintelligible) have it for 44 minutes of CSI which is to say song, can&#8217;t kill the album. It&#8217;s a preview that you&#8217;d actually monetizing and bump more preview with to begin with. So, it better suited in television for this kind of distribution to begin with. The second is which (unintelligible) you&#8217;re not going to go in the same way &#8217;cause it&#8217;s very different, kind of an economic model, a different preview model. With respect to television, if you think about the future of television being video, you have a much better proactive aggressive way to extend your business going forward. If you think about online and TV as separate, you&#8217;ve got a problem because you&#8217;re setting up a dichotomy and you&#8217;re making it so your online buyers are different than your on air buyers. And as soon at that happens, (unintelligible) your online buyers with the same ones who buy in Google keywords&#8230;Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah. Mr. SMITH: And who generally generate targeted ROI as supposed to reach frequency engagement and part of the magic. So, one of the things that we really believe in at CBS(ph) was why structure our sales group so close to the network sales is this is to increase our television&#8217;s video as soon as Joanne Ross who runs network sales from CBS gets a client that ask whether or not they can buy something online as well as on on-air. Then the answer is yes, that&#8217;s called (unintelligible). And that&#8217;s the beginnings of which we embrace so early television, you know, TV everywhere authentication. If you really believe in its most elegant state what that really means is, it doesn&#8217;t matter what screen you watch Ghost Whisperer on and you know you do. It doesn&#8217;t matter what time you watch Ghost Whisperer what should matter is you watch this, it got counted preferably by some third party referee, like oh &#8211; I don&#8217;t know, Nielsen. And I do have the same Nielsen in this case because thatâ\\x80\\x99s what the major buyers listen to. And then you get paid for it. So, assuming you can create that kind of environment, that matters a lot more, right now unfortunately, that means, ideally pack them in ad for ad or get closer and the only way that you immediately get criticism of people who used to watch ads in television having make sure that they want to watch ads online. If the content is good, they&#8217;ll sit through when you have empirical evidence and direct evidence to suggest that. So, the rule number one of content is own your own rights of your content. Rule number two is, you know, make sure it&#8217;s good. Easy to say, difficult to execute on. Once you have that setup in infrastructure so that online and on air are sold in tandem. Then you&#8217;re pricing, cause youâ\\x80\\x99re bright, youâ\\x80\\x99re alluding to the fact that CPM online is much higher. I remembered, oh, we&#8217;re sold online. That&#8217;s great. You don&#8217;t have enough or you&#8217;re not selling enough to buyers. Not enough online buyers, right? We say the fastest going group of online video right now is &#8211; or the fastest growing market inside of online is online video. That&#8217;s great, itâ\\x80\\x99s growing from 600 million to 1.2 billion by most third party estimates. 1.2 billion, I had 70 billion reasons ofâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: How much of that is CBS, how much of that is YouTube? Mr. SMITH: So, you know, again, a lot of that stuff is relatively carefully concealed. If you could give us any kind of math on that you know in March Madness last year we did 25 million. Just for that event for 2 weeks. Mr. ARRINGTON: What do you think Googleâ\\x80\\x99s revenue is right now? Mr. SMITH: You know, again, Mr. ARRINGTON: Are they a client? No, so, just guessing. What do you think their revenue is? Mr. SMITH: I mean, I don&#8217;t know. I look at posts like yours on this.Mr. ARRINGTON: I bet you do know.Mr. SMITH: (unintelligible) a point of view. I mean you could tell you CPMs and whether they are matching butâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: What&#8217;s your point of view?Mr. SMITH: It&#8217;s &#8211; again, hang on a second. Mr. ARRINGTON: So you just refuse to answer that question.Mr. SMITH: I&#8217;m not refusing. I&#8217;m answering in a long winded way right? Jason who&#8217;s an extremely good guy, he&#8217;s a good CEO, strong in execution of this, happens to believe that the right answer to this right now isn&#8217;t impacting us with as many ads. I&#8217;m not saying he&#8217;s going to get, you know, 30 (unintelligible) and PSAâ\\x80\\x99s. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. SMITH: But maybe he&#8217;s going to go to subscription model or get paid on the (unintelligible) Mr. ARRINGTON: He&#8217;s not monetizing as hard as he could.Mr. SMITH: I don&#8217;t think he generally would by the way. Mr. ARRINGTON: Do you think he&#8217;s selling all the inventory he has already?Mr. SMITH: Maybe. But all the inventory is the available inventory for an online buyer. What I&#8217;m saying is go to the media planners who are in charge with television.Mr. ARRINGTON: And they&#8217;re not doing that yet, as far as you know. Mr. SMITH: I think you can start to scratch it but I don&#8217;t think you sell reach and frequency because those parts are what we&#8217;re looking for. I&#8217;m hopeful, that in the out fronts is the clients and the agencies who are coming and say, that&#8217;s great but I want it on all screens. As soon as you have that conversation, the answer is keep it from a reach and frequency to begin. Future television becomes to be about video. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah. Mr. SMITH: As a content provider, you love that more than ever. Because all that means is this have defense anymore, you&#8217;re not acting like a dinosaur. You&#8217;re extending the economics to television and online. And those are great economics and the model by the way, that seems to be working. So, if you get that, it sound &#8211; it sound defensive to say but it&#8217;s true. So, if you get that, I&#8217;d say take a 1.2 billion get rid of it. Give it back to Google Keyword ad buy. Go have fun with that. Take the 70 billion of the real advertisers and marketers in the television industry and expand that relationship to online as well and make sure that CSI isn&#8217;t just sold on air vs. online but sold holistically. That&#8217;s where authentication is at its core. So, the trustâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: And revenue should increase by many times, right? Mr. SMITH: Yes.Mr. ARRINGTON: Because if you look at the revenue that hulu gets from video it canâ\\x80\\x99t be more than cent or two right? I mean, looking at sort of normal CPM, right? Maybe a few cents, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.Mr. SMITH: Yeah. Soâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: So &#8211; but if you look at like an average â\\x80\\x93 at the top CBS show if you start dividing that sort of revenue of a show divided by the number of viewers youâ\\x80\\x99re more into what, 50-cent range per viewer per show? I know you guys donâ\\x80\\x99t think of it that way. Mr. SMITH: We do. We do math on that log â\\x80\\x93 you know, by the way, add â\\x80\\x93 added it â\\x80\\x93 you know, the thing about CBS interactive is close relationship with guys like David Poltrack who runs research for CBS. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all allies here. Weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to figure this out together. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. SMITH: What weâ\\x80\\x99ll never say is CBS is hold-off until we figure it out. Itâ\\x80\\x99s there users want it. So you got to stream. But if you could be smarter inside this see through (unintelligible) think about the trusted partners in Comcast. I mean, people always say like, are you going to do an Apple subscription television model deal with CBS or something like that. I think itâ\\x80\\x99s a question of inevitably yes, but the issue staging.  How you going to do that relationship first versus that and where the bigger economics would fall now. And by the way, youâ\\x80\\x99re looking at DVD revenue, youâ\\x80\\x99re looking at syndication, youâ\\x80\\x99re looking at international. All these things could be added if â\\x80\\x93 if you could just figure out, you know, most holistically think about the spreadsheet. Spreadsheet says my CSI episode cost this much, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to monetize it the final way on this, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to use EST here Netflix there. No Amazon on blocks for that one because the audience didnâ\\x80\\x99t go as well there. This is a little futuristic. Mobile me yes, MediaFlo there, Verizon that and may be bump into CBS.com here and TV.com and, you know, maybe syndicated out there, make it embeddable or not in YouTube, right? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the â\\x80\\x93 the holistic way. By the way, Two and a Half Men, totally different formula, totally different audience, right? But the object is take the content to where the people want it and make sure you get paid for it in a way that makes sense. Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the best show on television right now?Mr. SMITH: According to numbers or according toâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: Just your opinion.Mr. SMITH: My opinion definitely doesnâ\\x80\\x99t reflect theâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: You wonâ\\x80\\x99t even fucking tell me â\\x80\\x93 OK, let me cut that out. You wonâ\\x80\\x99t even tell me your favorite TV show. I mean, I can keepâ\\x80¦Mr. SMITH: We have totally different favorite TV show. My favorite TV show right now?Mr. ARRINGTON: Is?Mr. SMITH: 30 Rock. Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. Mine too. Mr. SMITH: 30 Rock free. But you knowâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: I got to answer only one question. Mr. SMITH: Yeah. Favorite overall The Wire.Mr. ARRINGTON: Come on, The Wire right now. Mr. SMITH: Rip and run. Rip and run.Mr. ARRINGTON: So, this was going to be a five-minute video, now over half an hour or so itâ\\x80\\x99s great content though â\\x80\\x93 what â\\x80\\x93 what else do you want to say, you know, like potential clients out there? Mr. SMITH: Well, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a big opportunity there. Best on the â\\x80\\x93 TechCrunch, how about TechCrunch?Mr. MARQUEZ: We can only hopeâ\\x80¦Mr. SMITH: Letâ\\x80\\x99s see that (unintelligible). Where is your content? Bring it over. We can haveâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON:  Do you guys have an office yet?Mr. SMITH: Does it matter?Mr. ARRINGTON: You donâ\\x80\\x99t have an office yet.Mr. SMITH: Well, wherever you need us to be. Mr. ARRINGTON: Whereâ\\x80\\x99s your office? Did you take â\\x80\\x93 I hear thereâ\\x80\\x99s an opening at Menlo Park officeâ\\x80¦ Mr. DAVIS: We have two offices. Mr. ARRINGTON: Where CBS used to be. Whatâ\\x80¦Mr. DAVIS: We have two offices. Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. Mr. DAVIS: Weâ\\x80\\x99ll have an office in San Francisco. Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah.Mr. DAVIS: We have at aâ\\x80¦ Mr. MARQUEZ: Yes, we have office right now in Ferry Building, just north of (unintelligible).Mr. SMITH: Yeah.Mr. MARQUEZ: And then we have â\\x80\\x93 weâ\\x80\\x99re moving in a new space in South of Market in San Francisco.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. But you live in New York.Mr. DAVIS: Yeah, offices â\\x80\\x93 offices in New York, yeah.Mr. ARRINGTON: OK. Mr. DAVIS: Right there at midtown.

But no, there are no specific discrete transactions that have gone aroundâ\\x80¦Mr. ARRINGTON: You donâ\\x80\\x99t get to pay the firstâ\\x80¦Mr. DAVIS: But thatâ\\x80\\x99s implied that we tried and failed.

       "  'comments_content': 'Paris-based Semiocast, which helps brands understand and interact with real-time Web services, has performed a semantic and quantitative study of Twitter based on an analysis of 2.8 million tweets. Turns out roughly half the tweets posted on the micro-sharing service are in English, down 25% from last year, even though the company is based in the U.S. and has more users and momentum in English-speaking countries than anywhere else on the planet. The analysis further showed that the top 5 languages used on Twitter are English, Japanese, Portuguese, Malay and Spanish.Semiocast says the study was conducted on messages gathered over a period of 48 hours, from February 8 to February 10, with the sole aim of determining which languages were most often used on Twitter. The messages were processed with the company&#8217;s own analysis tools, which it says can identify the language used in short messages for some 41 languages, including Greek, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, Tamil, etc.English is still the most used language on Twitter, with 50% of messages, although Semiocast says this is a far cry from the two-third share they registered for English in the first half of 2009. Semiocast also forecasts that its share will grow thinner in the future, as Twitter becomes more internationalized (i.e. becomes available in more languages) and its pervasiveness spreads to Asia and Latin-America.Japanese comes in second with 14% of messages. This isn&#8217;t all too surprising; Twitter has been addressing that market for almost two years now. The third most used language is Portuguese with 9% of all messages, mirroring the success of social networks in Brazil. The rapid adoption of Twitter in Malaysia and Indonesia, where Twitter has partnerships with two mobile telcos in place, shows in the rankings as well. Malay languages, including Bahasa Malaysia and Bahasa Indonesia, now represent the fourth most used language on Twitter, with 6% of messages. Spanish comes in fifth with 4% of all messages.The ranks six to eight are occupied by major European languages, namely Italian, Dutch and German, each accounting for about 1% to 2% of total messages. French represents a little less than 1% of total messages.For your reference: Twitter earlier this week claimed that it was seeing about 50 million tweets per day now, so an analysis of less than 3 million messages measured over two days may not be super representative. Nevertheless, it only takes a peek at Twitter&#8217;s public timeline to see that there are lots of people using the service in a language other than English.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Twones started life as a FriendFeed-type service that aggregated various music services into a single stream, which we dubbed a social music feed when we first caught wind of it. Problem was, the startup says, since users generally couldn&#8217;t play the music on their site and were constantly being directed to third-party websites and apps for streaming, people never really got that FriendFeed experience that would compel them to come back.The Dutch company figured they needed to do something else, and the result of their overhauled strategy will be going live in alpha mode this morning. The short version: it&#8217;s Delicious-type bookmarking meets StumbleUpon-type discovery for online music.Essentially, Twones will now focus on what it refers to as the &#8220;Music Bar&#8221;, a browser add-on / bookmarklet that lets users bookmark music that is being streamed on other websites or MP3 blogs and discover music others have bookmarked in a fun way. The Music Bar will debut as a Firefox extension, but Chrome and Internet Explorer versions are near completion, I&#8217;m told.When installed, you can use Twones to bookmark music on thousands of supported websites, manage your virtual collection in a sidebar that looks a lot like Delicious, and share music with others in Twones or on services like Twitter and Facebook. In addition, any music you stream can be scrobbled to Last.fm so you can keep track of it there.Finally, there&#8217;s an &#8216;Explore&#8217; button that basically lets people jump to any random track that is in Twones&#8217; database &#8211; no need to install the Music Bar even for that. This can be a great way to discover new music, but arguably there is a need for some kind of controller that lets you explore tracks within a certain genre, at least.The problem with Twones is that, since it revolves almost entirely around music that&#8217;s being shared online elsewhere, you&#8217;re never quite sure if the songs you&#8217;re so carefully bookmarking are going to be there tomorrow, because the source could be gone for whatever reason. The startup says it&#8217;s working on ways to downsize that issue.Twones aims to make money from advertising, affiliate revenues, maybe a premium version down the line, and/or as an analytics service for online music sharing (kind of what Bit.ly does for general links today). They haven&#8217;t really figured out which path to take right now, but the startup says the $500k seed funding it raised earlier is enough to buy them time to do so, as they are very &#8216;cost efficient&#8217; in the sense that there&#8217;s no need to store a gigantic amount of music on their servers, seal license deals or run a complex content distribution network.All in all, I could see myself using Twones for sure, but it feels more like a feature than a solid business to me.

The startup is launching an &#8220;Upload by Email&#8221; feature that lets users store email attachments in their SugarSync account with the ease of sending an email.   The new feature allows a SugarSync user to sync any email attachment to a dedicated folder in their SugarSync account by simply forwarding it to a special email address. Instantly, the file(s) is available on all synced devices and accounts. For example, if a user receives an email with many attachments, they can simply forward it to their SugarSync email address (comprised of random numbers and letters for spam protection). All attachments will transfer to their SugarSync account.For added security, SugarSync will scan all file attachments for viruses prior to syncing, and certain file types are not accepted (e.g., .exe, .cmd, .bat) to prevent malicious files from landing in an account.At the moment, SugarSync is supporting 2 petabytes of data from users. SugarSync&#8217;s CEO Laura Yecies says that because of the popularity of the product, the company is adding a new power-user storage account that has 500 GB of storage, priced at $39.99 per month. Previously, the highest level of storage available was 250 GB.SugarSync recently launched a small business friendly offering, which Yecies says is gaining considerable traction. You can read our past reviews of SugarSync here and here. The startup has ramped up its mobile offerings, with supports for  Android, iPhone, Blackberry, and Windows Mobile powered phones.

       "  'comments_content': 'For the past two days, Yahoo has been trying to get me to agree to an embargo on some piece of news they had for tonight. As you probably know, we hate embargoes, so I wasn&#8217;t about to accept it. Good thing. Not only did the news leak out almost 5 hours early, but actually, Yahoo itself was giving people hints on Twitter all day, and encouraging people to take guesses to break the embargo on Twitter. And yes, the news is a deal with Twitter.So first, the news: Yahoo and Twitter have reached an agreement to share data between their properties. That&#8217;s great. Yahoo is only a few months behind Google and Microsoft (Bing) doing the same thing. And really, I&#8217;m not entirely sure why some kind of special deal was needed. For search, Bing is about to take over the data aspect for Yahoo, and that will very likely include the Twitter data. Meanwhile, Yahoo&#8217;s frontend elements and services already include Twitter integration, including Flickr. Plus, isn&#8217;t Facebook Connect handling all the social stuff for Yahoo soon anyway?Well, I&#8217;ll wait for the press release coming in 4 hours for more details about that (see below).The more amusing angle to me is not only the embargo break, but the fact that Yahoo is so starved for attention, they&#8217;re resorting to playing games with their Twitter followers to make them guess embargoed news. Here are the first four of five clues that Yahoo tweeted out today:Clue #1/5: Who has approx 29,000 followers as of this morning? #ybignewsClue #2/5: What kind of &#8220;moon&#8221; had teen moviegoers swooning last fall? #ybignewsClue #3/5: Who might you greet with a friendly â\\x80\\x9chowdyâ\\x80\\x9d? #ybignews (use hashtag for previous clues)Clue #4/5:What&#8217;s both a sugar substitute &amp; a mathematical symbol? #ybignews (use hashtag for previous clues-forms a phrase)Our own Jason Kincaid is a master of reading these clues (and apparently knows something about the Twilight saga). Here are the answers:1: Yahoo2: New3: Partner4: EqualAnd, of course, 5, which hasn&#8217;t been released yet, will equal &#8220;Twitter&#8221; in some way. And those quick enough on the uptake could probably figure out that since Yahoo was using Twitter to hint this new deal, the partner is in fact, Twitter.Oh, Yahoo, thankfully you have MySpace to make you look not-so-bad by comparison (cycling team and all). As for Twitter, this is likely another solid revenue stream for the hot startup that now has the money-making engines going (with more coming soon).And here&#8217;s the full release for those interested in the actual news:SUNNYVALE, Calif., Feb. 23, 2010 â\\x80\\x93 As part of its ongoing commitment to be the center of peopleâ\\x80\\x99s online lives, Yahoo Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) today announced a global partnership with Twitter to integrate Twitterâ\\x80\\x99s real-time social experiences with more than 600 million people in Yahoo!â\\x80\\x99s global network. The integration is part of Yahoo!â\\x80\\x99s commitment to provide personally relevant information to people, from sources across the Web.A little bird told me: @yahoo is the place to tweet and be tweetedThis partnership includes three primary elements:People will be able to access their personal Twitter feeds across Yahoo!â\\x80\\x99s many products and properties, including the homepage, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Sports, and others, letting them check in more easily on whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening with the people and things they care about while on Yahoo!.People will be able to update their Twitter status and share content from Yahoo! in their Twitter stream, so they can easily share their Yahoo! experiences with their friends and followers on Twitter.Yahoo! Search and Yahoo! media properties like News, Finance, Entertainment, and Sports will include real-time public Twitter updates across a variety of topics. Yahoo! Search users will immediately see real-time Twitter results today; go to Yahoo! and try it out.Tweet and shout: @yahoo pumps up the social volumeTodayâ\\x80\\x99s Twitter partnership, along with Yahoo!&#8217;s recently announced Facebook relationship, will transform Yahoo! into a highly customizable social experience that lets people bring together and unify their activity from their many social experiences across the Web. Because of these connections, anyone with a Yahoo! ID can update multiple social networks simultaneously and stay in touch with the people and information that matter most at every moment of the day. â\\x80\\x9cLet me try to capture the enormity of this integration in 140 characters or less: Weâ\\x80\\x99re turning the key to the online social universe â\\x80\\x94 you will find the most personally relevant experiences through Yahoo!,â\\x80\\x9d said Bryan Lamkin, senior vice president, consumer products group, Yahoo!. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re also simplifying peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives by bringing their social worlds â\\x80\\x94 and the world â\\x80\\x94- together for easy access.â\\x80\\x9dAdd an exclamation point to your tweetsThe Twitter integration also provides full access to the complete Twitter public data stream, which Yahoo! will use to improve the relevance and freshness of content across Yahoo! properties. This will drive deeper user engagement, and create new and compelling opportunities for developers, advertisers, and publishers. &#8220;The information in one single tweet can travel light-years farther with this Yahoo! integration.&#8221; said Twitter cofounder, Biz Stone. &#8220;Tweets in more places brings relevance where and when you need it most.&#8221;The real-time Search integration is available immediately. Other parts of the integration are expected to launch later this year.About Yahoo!Yahoo! attracts hundreds of millions of users every month through its innovative technology and engaging content and services, making it one of the most trafficked Internet destinations and a world-class online media company.

       "  'comments_content': 'The European Union has opened an antitrust investigation into Google to look into claims made by three European-based Internet companies. Not surprisingly, this key part of the investigation is said to be about search, which is dominated by Google is most of the EU markets. The Telegraph and WSJ have more details.It&#8217;s important to note that this probe is just a preliminary one, and nothing may come of it. But at least three companies have filed complaints against Google â\\x80\\x94 and notably, one of them is owned by Microsoft. And another one is a member of a group that is partially funded by Microsoft.This is, of course, quite interesting since Microsoft has famously been involved in antitrust investigations for over a decade nowÂ\\xa0in Europe (and previously, of course, the U.S. too). In fact, this whole browser ballot thing is a result of the ongoing EU attempt to make sure Microsoft is playing fairly.Ciao (which is now called Ciao Bing) is the Microsoft-owned German shopping site making one of the complaints. Microsoft purchased them in 2008 for nearly $500 million. The others are Foundem, a UK-based shopping site, and EJustice.fr, a French site that does legal search inquiries. All three are claiming that Google&#8217;s search dominance is hurting their businesses. And Foundem is claiming that Google has placed a &#8220;search penalty&#8221; on its site, which has crippled it.Something else interesting, as The Telegraph notes, &#8220;Foundem is a member of ICOMP, an internet pressure group which receives funding from Microsoft.&#8221;This could get ugly.Update: Here&#8217;s a post on Google&#8217;s Public Policy Blog. Not surprisingly, Google makes quick note of both Ciao and Foundem&#8217;s ties to Microsoft.Here&#8217;s a few key excerpts:The European Commission has notified us that it has received complaints from three companies: a UK price comparison site,Â\\xa0Foundem, a French legal search engine calledÂ\\xa0ejustice.fr, and Microsoft&#8217;sÂ\\xa0Ciao! from Bing. While we will be providing feedback and additional information on these complaints, we are confident that our business operates in the interests of users and partners, as well as in line with European competition law.Given that these complaints will generate interest in the media, we wanted to provide some background to them. First, search. Foundem &#8211; a member of an organisation calledÂ\\xa0ICOMPwhich is funded partly by Microsoft -Â\\xa0argues that our algorithms demote their site in our results because they are aÂ\\xa0vertical search engine and so a direct competitor to Google. ejustice.fr&#8217;s complaint seems to echo these concerns.And:We understand how important rankings can be to websites, especially commercial ones, because a higher ranking typically drives higher volumes of traffic. We are also the first to admit that our search is not perfect, but it&#8217;s a very hard computer science problem to crack. Imagine having to rank the 272 million possible results for a popular query like the iPod on a 14 by 12 screen computer screen in just a few milliseconds. It&#8217;s a challenge we face millions of times each day.And:Regarding Ciao!, they were a long-time AdSense partner of Google&#8217;s, with whom we always had a good relationship. However, after MicrosoftÂ\\xa0acquired Ciao! in 2008 (renaming itÂ\\xa0Ciao! from Bing) we started receiving complaints about our standard terms and conditions. They initiallyÂ\\xa0took their case to the German competition authority, but it now has been transferred to Brussels.Though each case raises slightly different issues, the question they ultimately pose is whether Google is doing anything to choke off competition or hurt our users and partners. This is not the case. We always try to listen carefully if someone has a real concern and we work hard to put our users&#8217; interests first and to compete fair and square in the market. We believe our business practices reflect those commitments.[photo: flickr/fazen]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'This is has not been confirmed by either party, but we&#8217;ve heard from multiple sources that European music startup Spotify has closed a venture investment from Founders Fund. Managing Partner Sean Parker, who was a cofounder of Napster and President of Facebook, led the round for Founders Fund, and we believe he may have take a board of directors seat. We do not know the size of the investement; however, we believe it may have been a token amount to get Parker&#8217;s involvement in the company. The investment was likely done at the same â\\x82¬200 million valuation as the round Spotify raised in late 2009.  This is the first U.S. investor in Spotify, and the service is only available in some European countries. A U.S. launch has been broadly anticipated for months.We&#8217;ve also heard this was a competitive round and a number of U.S. venture funds were interested. Parker, with his ties to Facebook and his experience in early P2P music sharing via Napster, is likely the winner for his strong strategic potential.In January we reported that Spotify had been in talks with Google over integration with Android for their U.S. launch. When Spotify does launch in the U.S. (assuming it does), we expect them to have a large U.S. partner alongside them. Google, Facebook and Microsoft are all likely to be talking to them, and we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see one or more of them sign a partnership.CrunchBase Information',\n",

In January at the iPad launch event, Steve Jobs noted that &#8220;Apple is the largest mobile devices company in the world now.&#8221; And responding to a direct question today at a Goldman Sachs conference, liveblogged by the WSJ, COO Tim Cook reiterated: &#8220;Yes, you should definitely look at Apple as a mobile-device company.&#8221;Cook also pointed out that the majority of Apple&#8217;s revenues now comes from mobile devices (including laptops) or content for those devices.  Indeed, if you look at the breakdown of Apple&#8217;s fourth quarter revenues of $15.7 billion, nearly $12 billion of that came from portable Macbooks ($2.8 billion), iPods ($3.4 billion) and iPhones $5.6 billion).  And another $1.2 billion came from iTunes.Apple isn&#8217;t abandoning computers.  It is a mobile device company because computing is going mobile.  What about things like Apple TV?  &#8220;Apple TV is a hobby,&#8221; Cook says dismissively, echoing another sentiment Jobs has expressed before.

And one problem you may face is pulling all of this information together to build a single online identity â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0be it for personal use, or to create a professional online profile.  Flavors.me is a new site launching today that looks to make this as simple as possible, and it does so with flying colors. After a three month long private beta, the site has just launched to the public.The service is as simple as they come.  After completing a basic sign up form, you link your Flavors.me page to any of 15 online services, with options that include Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn (as well as any RSS feed).  Flavors.me taps into these services via their APIs (you generally enter your credentials using OAuth or Facebook Connect), and within minutes you&#8217;re ready to start customizing your site.All of your linked content is pulled into your Flavors.me page so it&#8217;s easy to access, but it&#8217;s never overwhelming â\\x80\\x94 the site&#8217;s templates are minimalist, and hide everything but your name and a list of your online feeds/profiles at first.  If you click on one of these feeds, the content will smoothly transition into view; it&#8217;s all very slick.  You can also tweak your page&#8217;s color scheme, backgrounds, and layout to suit your taste (though there are only a handful of layouts to choose from initially).You can get a feel for what&#8217;s possible by checking out my Flavors.me page, which took me all of ten minutes to set up â\\x80\\x94 keep in mind that it&#8217;s entirely possible to make a page that looks better than this with a little more time.There are plenty of other services out there that let you list all of your online presences in one place, with options including chi.mp, card.ly, UnHub, and even Google Profiles.  But Flavors.me really makes the process extremely simple, and the results look great.Flavors.me is free for its basic features,  and will generate revenue through premium subscriptions, which are $20 a year.  Premium features include the ability to use your own custom domain name, real time statistics, and the ability to include a contact form in your page (though obviously you could just include your Email address in the standard &#8216;About&#8217; field).Flavors.me was built by HiiDef, an incubator started by former Vimeo exec Jonathan Marcus and his brother, David Marcus.Flavors.me from Jack Zerby on Vimeo.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The news of the bankruptcy led to a flurry of reports about Sellaband calling it quits for good &#8211; or as we like to say, hitting the deadpool.Now it appears that there&#8217;s a chance the startup may live to fight another fight after all.A message that was very recently posted on the Sellaband website claims that an acquisition of the business is imminent, and merely a matter of a &#8220;few technicalities&#8221; at this point.The full note:On Friday February 19th, SellaBand AG requested provisional suspension of payments (moratorium). This was granted by the Court in Amsterdam on the same day. Yesterday, Monday February 22nd, this moratorium was changed into bankruptcy, with appointment of, Mr Paul Schaink, an amsterdam lawyer, as trustee. The trustee wishes to inform the &#8216;Sellaband community&#8217; that, apart from a few technicalities, the completion of a transaction with a potential buyer of the business, is to be expected soon, in order to make a fresh start, safeguarding both the rights of Believers and Artists. More news will follow shortly.On behalf of the trustee,Johan VosmeijerCEO SellaBandFrom what I can gather, Sellaband was close to breaking even, after raising $5 million in venture capital back in 2008. That on itself is not an easy feat to accomplish in the cutthroat business of online music and crowdfunding services.

       "  'comments_content': 'Well &#8211; not entirely. After all, it&#8217;s bright, responsive, and has a much higher resolution. But there is a lot more to making a good screen, and under a detailed analysis it&#8217;s far from a rout when you pit HTC&#8217;s bleeding-edge OLED screen against the old-school LCD of the iPhone.Apologies if it gets a bit technical. Here is the basic list of complaints, as investigated here:As has been noted before, the Nexus One uses a PenTile sub-pixel layout, which is a sophisticated new way of creating pixels which changes the layout of color sub-pixels. Each pixel has its own green sub-pixel, but uses an algorithm to &#8220;share&#8221; red and blue sub-pixels when necessary. Most of the time this won&#8217;t be a problem, and it can increase brightness and help with pixel density, but it will lead to artifacts in greys and possibly has something to do with the next complaint.Apparently, the Nexus One only uses 16-bit color. You know, the kind of color you had on your PC back around 1998? It has 32 levels each of red and blue, and 64 for green. The iPhone (like most quality mobile LCDs) has 18-bit color with dithering, which allows it to emulate full 24-bit color if you don&#8217;t look too closely. Sounds like a bunch of numbers, right? Well the chart above should illustrate it nicely, and the people who tested it say it&#8217;s pretty striking in vivo, and noisy as well. The bit count produces smooth color gradients on the iPhone, where on the Nexus One you&#8217;ll see banding. If you want to see your pictures the way they actually look, color depth is important.The display on the iPhone is actually significantly brighter, though its contrast is far worse. This is due to the Nexus One&#8217;s OLED nature, which allows blacks to be truly black (as in, no light there). In the end it&#8217;s kind of a draw, but the iPhone&#8217;s display wins by default because greater brightness means more visibility in more areas. I haven&#8217;t had trouble with my Zune HD outside, but I defer to their lab results.OLED displays, including the Nexus One&#8217;s, are still very a young technology. This means there are a lot of kinks to be worked out in hardware, software, and drivers. Poor calibration standards at the factory can be obscured by artificial contrast and saturation, but close inspection reveals that &#8220;if the Nexus One display were an LCD it would rank among the worst displays we have ever seen in a shipping product.&#8221;The scaling mechanism used to stretch or shrink images to fit the 800&#215;480 screen is &#8220;laughably primitive.&#8221; If you&#8217;re not familiar with scaling mechanisms, it&#8217;s worth reading up on quickly, as you use them every day and likely aren&#8217;t even aware. For different content, resolutions, and color depths, different scalers perform worse or better, and it seems Google or HTC chose one that just doesn&#8217;t work very well. It can have a serious effect on image quality and text readability, especially when combined with that PenTile sub-pixel layout.So: strong words, but they seem to be backed up by real data (the shootout&#8217;s index page is here; the final part will run on March 1st). Remember that the Nexus One&#8217;s display is also going to be used in a number of other HTC products, like its twin the Desire and likely any other handset they put out with an 800&#215;480 OLED display.The fact is, though, that LCD is an end-of-run technology that has been honed to as close to perfection as it&#8217;s ever likely to get. LCDs that cost $200 now would have cost thousands just a few years ago. OLED is the future &mdash; there&#8217;s no doubt about that. But in the present, devices like the Nexus One and Zune HD qualify as early adopters. While they impress in some areas, namely those in which the OLEDs outshine LCDs fundamentally (black levels and consequent contrast; power draw), there are still plenty of points on the LCD side of the board.It won&#8217;t be long before we start seeing much improved OLED displays &mdash; we are seeing them already in the form of Samsung&#8217;s simplified &#8220;Super AMOLED&#8221; in the Wave, which omits a piece of the display &#8220;layer cake,&#8221; allowing for better brightness and less reflectance. This rapid gaining of OLED on LCD has led to rumors that Apple will be adopting the technology for the next iPhone, which really is a pretty reasonable speculation.I haven&#8217;t personally inspected the Nexus One&#8217;s screen for more than minute total, and I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time around iPhones, so I can&#8217;t add any anecdotal evidence to this little duel. And it goes almost without saying that if the display works for you, then there&#8217;s nothing to worry about; this is purely an academic conflict for most. But go ahead and add your data point below.Update: People are noting that the Gallery app has some really bad compression when it loads pictures not at full rez, which would be the source of some of the banding for sure. As I noted, bad picture quality can result very easily from bad software, scaling, and so on. This is stuff Google tends to fix. So much for the banding, which appears to be a software issue, but that&#8217;s not the only piece of the puzzle.

       "  'comments_content': 'Twitter is getting closer to launching its own advertising on the micro-messaging service.  Speaking on an advertising industry panel yesterday, the company&#8217;s head of monetization, Anamitra Banerji, confirmed that Twitter would launch its own advertising platform within a month or so, at least in a beta test.  Twitter has been planning to launch an advertising product for a long time.  Last November, COO Dick Costolo told us at our Realtime Crunchup that ads were coming.  He promised the new ads &#8220;will be fascinating. Non-traditional. And people will love it.&#8221;  And a year ago, Twitter execs discussed different advertising revenue models in a strategy meeting, including realtime search ads, sponsored Tweets, and AdSense-like widgets that could appear on other sites.Of course, other startups are already experimenting with their own Twitter ads ranging from in-stream sponsored Tweets (Ad.ly) to placing retweet buttons on display ads themselves (Tweetmeme).  But what will an official Twitter ad look like?  And will people really love it?There are lots of options for different ad units on Twitter. Â\\xa0Seth Goldstein, the CEO of SocialMedia, was on the same panel and is the one who grilled Banerji about Twitter&#8217;s ad plans. Â\\xa0He presented the slide above, which gives some flavor the types of ads which could appear in a social stream like Twitter. Â\\xa0Ads could range from straight endorsements (&#8220;This is my favorite salsa&#8221;, &#8220;My favorite car is a Jetta&#8221;) to more subtle local business ads (&#8220;I am at Starbucks,&#8221; &#8220;I am the Mayor of Superdive&#8221;).Other people think the Tweets themselves should be sacrosanct. Â\\xa0Robert Scoble, for instance, suggests the idea of a SuperTweet with all sorts of metadata that pops up when part of the message is rolled over with your mouse. Â\\xa0This data could include things such as the location of the Tweet and how many times it&#8217;s been retweeted, but it could also trigger a contextual ad triggered by certain keywords.Most likely, the ads will start out simple. Â\\xa0If they are in-stream ads, they will be clearly labeled as such, perhaps by highlighting the Tweet with a different background color or otherwise clearly marking it as &#8220;Sponsored.&#8221;  Right now, the only way you know something is a sponsored Tweet is if it is disclosed in the text of the Tweet itself, like in this Ad.ly example:Twitter could make them stand out more and really distinguish them as ads. Â\\xa0But that in itself would find little love from most Twitter users. Â\\xa0For ads to work on Twitter, or anywhere else on the Web for that matter, they need to be authentic and useful. Contextual ads related to keywords in specific Tweets or shown only to people who are known to be interested in related topics is a better approach. Â\\xa0It is fairly simple to analyze people&#8217;s Tweet streams and cull the main topics they either talk about or the topics of the Tweets the people they follow talk about. Â\\xa0Semantically targeted ads should perform better than random ones. Â\\xa0But it&#8217;s still not clear what there would be to love there.It also is not clear what the rules will be for Twitter ads. Will they just start appearing in everyone&#8217;s stream, or do you have to allow ads into your stream? Â\\xa0And if you allow the ads, do you get a cut of the ad revenues since they are being shown to your followers? Â\\xa0I&#8217;d be very surprised if there is a user opt-out for ads, and even if Twitter starts the ads on its own site it would make sense if it could syndicate them out to third-party Twitter clients. Â\\xa0Eventually, if a Twitter client takes the stream, it will have to take the ads as well. Â\\xa0Presumably, Twitter would offer them a cut of any ad revenues much like Google does with AdSense.Finally, there is the question of how the ads will be paid for. It makes little sense to charge on a per follower or per impression basis because people tend to read their Twitter streams sporadically. Â\\xa0A cost-per-click model would work much better. Twitter could create a keyword auction to trigger the insertion of the ads and advertisers would only pay for actual clicks like they do with search ads. Â\\xa0That way the entire message of the ad would not have to be contained in the Tweet itself.With 1.5 billion Tweets a month and growing, advertisers will certainly love any opportunity to insert themselves into the conversations occurring on Twitter.  But users generally don&#8217;t love ads, they hate them.  And it is hard to believe that Twitter is somehow going to magically change that basic fact of life.  You tell me: What would Twitter have to do to make you love its ads?CrunchBase Information',\n",

Today we&#8217;ve got a late 2009 powerpoint presentation created by Tim Sutcliffe, MySpace&#8217;s Senior Manager Information Architecture. The document summarizes the recommendations on rebuilding the MySpace developer/apps platform from an outside UK based user experience firm called Userfocus.Sutcliffe was part of Katie Geminder&#8217;s &#8220;swat team&#8221; organization at MySpace, and supposedly &#8220;knee deep&#8221; in the remakingmyspace project that we wrote about yesterday. Revamping the apps platform was a side project, but this document is representative of the type of work that group was doing, say sources.Or at least, sort of. This document recommends what some product people call &#8220;pushing pixels around&#8221; instead of rebuilding from scratch. The remakingmyspace project was clearly the latter. Although since that project has now been scratched, we&#8217;ll never know whether it would have been successful or not.The problem, as the document states, was that MySpace app installation rates were too low, and churn was too high, relative to Facebook: &#8220;MySpace apps are not performing cf. Facebook regarding churn and installs. Itâ\\x80\\x99s believed that these performance problems are caused by basic usability issues.&#8221;Sixteen pages of specific product recommendations followed.

       "  'comments_content': 'Like.com has been steadily expanding its mini digital fashion empire. There is Like.com itself, a visual shopping engine; Covet.com; a recently launched visual shopping personalization application; and Weardrobe, which is a social platform for users to shop street style compilations (Like.com acquired Weardrobe last December). Today, the company is expanding its mini-empire with the launch of visual styling tool Couturious. Couturious&#8217; focus is on 3D photo-realistic styling. You pick a photo of a model (you can choose from a variety of races and body types) and then style the model accordingly with clothes from over 100 different brands. Like.com&#8217;s computer vision technology allows your to dress a fairly realistic model and actually style them.  So you can tuck pants into boots, adjust the folding of a scarf or have the model wear the shirt with top few buttons open. And you can purchase any of the items that are styled and share your styles to Facebook and Twitter.The idea is for users to not figure out what to wear but how to wear it. Along with the ability to style a model from scratch, users can also see pre-set styles from stylists. At launch, Couturious has partnered with 20 of the top fashion bloggers in the industry to feature their own styles. Couturious is also partnering with 6 designers at launch (Tory Burch, Tibi, Charlotte Ronson, Yigal Azrouel, Cynthia Rowley, and Alice+Olivia) who are making items they debuted at last week&#8217;s fashion week in New York City available for users to style immediately, even though these items aren&#8217;t even in stores yet.  Like.com&#8217;s CEO and founder Munjal Shah says Couturious fits the strategy of revolutionizing the online soft goods shopping experience.  Weardrobe helps you to be visually inspired with streetstyle looks;  Covet helps you to visually personalize your shopping (using celebrity photos),  Like.com helps you to visually shop for soft goods and now Couturious will help you to visually style the items you have. Couturious makes money when people click on the links to buy the outfits, similar to the model on Like.com&#8217;s other sites. Couturious will also white label the technology to retailers and designer sites for a processing fee. Couturious will face competition from fellow styling site Polyvore. Like.com, which launched in 2006, is growing steadily both in revenue and networks. The startup raised $32 million in funding during the implosion of the financial industry, with a valuation just north of $100 million. And while we can&#8217;t reveal what&#8217;s to come, there is definitely more innovation in store for Like.com. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I&#8217;m a bit of a movie fanatic. As such, back in the day one of my favorite websites was Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX). On it, you bought and sold both movies (moviestocks) and movie stars (starbonds) based on how you thought they would do with upcoming releases. Of course, all of this was done with virtual cash (H bucks), making it a fun game. But in April, the game turns real. As in, real money.On April 20, HSX will become a real-money commodity exchange, according to The Hollywood Reporter. As such, they&#8217;ve had to file with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval, which they did in November, and are now in the final phase of approval, apparently. Yes, this is actually happening. And yes, this will essentially make HSX a real-world betting site.As THR notes:Once launched, a new HSX site will list current and imminent movie releases with their projected four-week domestic grosses and allow exchange users to take long or short positions on the films.And:Investors wishing to participate in the exchange will buy &#8220;contracts&#8221; priced at one one-millionth of a film&#8217;s projected boxoffice, with films to be listed on the exchange from the time productions are announced in the industry trade papers. Trading will begin six months before a movie&#8217;s anticipated wide release.And while the target audience is film fanatics, they&#8217;re also targeting Hollywood industry types, though warns that anyone doing any kind of insider trading is subject to prosecution just as with any other market.Cantor Exchange, which is working with HSX on this transition to real money has more details and is kicking things off with a practice exchange until the real one is approved:Everyone starts with 10,000 â\\x80\\x9cvirtual dollarsâ\\x80\\x9d in a Cantor Exchange practice account, and at the end of the practice period Cantor Exchange will convert each 1,000 virtual dollars of profit you earn into $10 cash and deposit it into your real-money trading account (maximum $100 per trader). So if you earn 10,000 virtual dollars in profit while practicing on Cantor Exchange, you get $100! There is no cost to participate in this program.This should be interesting, to say the least.

       "  'comments_content': 'For web publishing startups like Scribd and DocStoc, premium content is the viable business model to monetize their platforms. For example. Scribd has signed a number of deals with publishers to sell online books to users on the site. Today, DocStoc is officially opening up its premium content channel, called the DocStore, addressing a lightly different sector, with a focus on selling professional documents to businesses and individuals. DocStoc&#8217;s CEO and founder Jason Nazar says the one of the platform&#8217;s fastest growing user base segments are small business owners looking for free and paid documents for entrepreneurs, startups and professionals. Documents range from legal documents to real estate contracts to analysis to forms for business models. The DocStore also features documents in a variety of formats, including Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files. The marketplace has been open to select partners since last summer (including TechCrunch), but today will mark its public debut.On the seller side, the DocStore allows document sellers, such as LegalZoom, Career Press, and BK Publishers,  to keep 100 percent of their sales for the first 60 days of a document&#8217;s lifetime on DocStoc. After that, DocStoc takes 50 percent of the sale price. DocStoc powers all of the payments (which can be made through credit cards) on the site and returns payments to sellers via check or PayPal. Sellers can sell their documents separately, or bundle them together as packages. For example, a business plan package could include an Excel spreadsheet, a PowerPoint presentation and a Word document. And sellers can monitor their sales, documents through a customized dashboard with reports, conversion rates and analytics. Nazar says that DocStoc vets all sellers and documents to ensure that each document is legitimate.DocStoc will also be adding the ability for anyone to embed widgets with the for sale documents in blogs to collect affiliate fees, similar to the Amazon model. Affiliate revenue will be deducted from DocStoc&#8217;s 50 percent share of the ale, not the Seller&#8217;s sale. Lazar says that DocStoc is working to maximize conversion rates for sales, even offering a 1-800 customer service hotline for any potential buyers who have questions about documents for sale. And sellers can choose to turn of ads on pages where they are selling documents.Additionally, Nazar says DocStoc will be adding more of its own self-curated content to to the platform, which will be available to users who have a paid subscription to the site. Users will soon have immediate access to over 1000 documents, which range from what to do when you get a DUI to marital settlement agreements. With 3 million registered users, DocStoc is now profitable. Nazar says that the company is seeing 20 million uniques per month and is growing rapidly as a business focused site. It makes sens for DocStoc to cater to the professional community and its marketplace seems like a good bet, especially with the affiliate ecosystem.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Tweetmeme wants to help you gain followers with a new Follow Button you can place on your blog or Website.  It looks very much like Tweetmeme&#8217;s ReTweet button, which is on 100,000 sites and registering 7 billion monthly impressions across the web, except it says &#8220;Follow&#8221; instead of &#8220;Retweet.&#8221;  When you click on the Follow button, a window pops open that lets you sign into Twitter and follow the account tied to the button (usually the person or publication of the site the button is on).The Follow button comes in different shapes and sizes, shows how many followers you have, and is tied into analytics services such as TwitterCounter, Twitalyzer, and TwitterGrader.  The data from the Follow button should also appear in Tweetmeme&#8217;s own analytics.  But it doesn&#8217;t yet.  The Follow buttons are geared more towards advertisers, and indeed they can and will be placed in ads as well as on editorial content.  Tweetmeme is also working on turning its ReTweet button into an advertising platform with AdTweets.Follow buttons are nothing new, but Tweetmeme has a lot of distribution muscle with its Retweet buttons.  The question is, how many buttons are you going to gunk up your site with?  Should we add a follow button to every post?CrunchBase Information',\n",

Â\\xa0The iPhone still trails behind Nokia&#8217;s Symbian-powered smartphones (No. 1), which saw their share decline 5.5 points to 46.9 percent, and RIM Blackberries (No. 2), which gained 3.3 points to end the year with a 19.9 percent share.Remember, these are worldwide estimates. Â\\xa0In the U.S., both Blackberry and Apple are much larger than Symbian. Â\\xa0And when it comes to mobile Web traffic, Apple and Android dominate with 81 percent share. Â\\xa0According to Gartner, Android phone sales jumped 3.4 points (to 3.9 percent), but Android is still smaller than WIndows Mobile or Linux. Â\\xa0Those mobile OSes, however, saw their market share drop Â\\xa03.1 and 2.9 percent, respectively. Â\\xa0Palm&#8217;s WebOS barely made a mark with 0.7 percent share.So when you tally everything up, Symbian lost the most share (5.5 percent), followed by Windows Mobile and Linux. Â\\xa0The iPhone saw the biggest gain (6.2 percent), compared to smaller but roughly equal jumps by Blackberry and Android (up 3.3 and 3.4 percent, respectively).All together, Gartner estimates 172 million smartphones were sold last year, up 24 percent. Â\\xa0In contrast, total mobile phone sales were flat at 1.2 billion. Â\\xa0Smartphones represented 14 percent of total mobile handset sales last year, up from 11 percent in 2008.

Wiredset&#8217;s Trendrr, a comprehensive digital data tracking platform, is launching a new realtime dashboard catered to TV networks. The new tracking platform, which is available to any Trendrr Pro users, allows film studios, networks and record labels to track and aggregate data surrounding their properties and gain instant insights on location, gender, volume, sentiment, and influence as the conversation takes place. The application gathers data from over 50 of the web&#8217;s social destinations, including Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, Last.fm, Amazon, Craigslist, and eBay, and delivers users a realtime view of data within a dashboard. The idea behind Trendrr&#8217;s entertainment-focused dashboard is that it will allow the film and television industries to gain actionable intelligence to determine future content decisions. For example, the new application will show a television network is gaining the most reactions by city, if the chatter is positive, and what aspects of a show are gaining traction among viewers and which segment of the population is most receptive to their content. Not only will this data help users determine where to place certain content, but can also help with advertising and marketing strategies. The application is already being used by TV Networks such as NBC Universal&#8217;s Oxygen, which is using it for the show, Bad Girls Club. The application will undoubtedly be useful to to measuring engagement on the web, especially on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. However, Trendrr is entering a space where many others are attempting to launch innovative applications. Scout Labs, Viralheat, PeopleBrowsr and Radian 6 are just a few of the startups that are helping companies, including media organizations, attempt to track movement across the web.

Now, the Holland-based company is launching a nifty, free software program (Windows only for now) that does exactly the same in the form of a native desktop client.Inbox2 collects all messages, document attachments, links and contacts from your existing email and social network accounts and brings everything into one place. The app doesn&#8217;t merely import incoming streams for consumption, as it also allows you to reply, search and manage all those incoming communication streams without having to login to multiple accounts. The list of supported services is key, and impressively long: the app boasts support for (deep breath) Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Outlook, Microsoft Exchange, AOL, any custom IMAP/POP3 account, and social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yammer and Hyves.In addition, Inbox2 allows the user to organize their inbox around people or content discovery, including through social and real-time channels. In that sense, it reminds a lot of Threadsy, one of the TechCrunch50 finalists, but they haven&#8217;t publicly launched yet. Also worth checking out for different reasons is OtherInbox.If you even use but two of the services that Inbox2 supports, I suggest you try out the Web service to start and give the desktop client a good whirl if you&#8217;re on Windows.

Historically the music industry was caught on the hop when Apple launched the iPod. Because it could play non-DRM MP3s the iPod was the perfect companion to the Napsters/Kazaas of this world. That was a business for Apple, but not for the music industry, which later found itself locked into the the Apple store. Eventually online stores started offering DRM-free MP3s for sale, but the slow-to react music industry has not recovered since. The same is true of books. Why lock down books to one device? But of course Amazon is trying to do exactly this with the Kindle. So it makes sense then to disrupt this again, with a service which syncs across platforms and devices. Step forward Kobo Books.Kobo is a cloud-based book store, previously only available in the US but now launching in the UK. Kobo is the re-branded Shortcovers online store which had been selling e-books for a while.It has a free e-reader software for the Mac, PC and smartphones allowing you to access titles purchase on any of your devices. On mobile it works on apps for the iPhone, Blackberry, Android, Palm Pre and any e-reader that can work with the EPUB-format books, such as the Barnes &#038; Noble Nook or the Sony Reader. Notably, the Kindle is absent from the list. Some reviewers think the Kobo app for iPhone is better than the Kindle app.In the US the Toronto-based Kobo has teamed up with Borders, REDgroup Retail and Instant Fame, effectively allowing it to distribute books worldwidein North Amercia, the EU, the UK, Australia and the Asia Pacific region. Borders has incorporated Kobo into its stores in the US. The free Kobo books come from the 1.8 million public-domain books from the Internet Archive.Titles include the latest best-sellers from the likes of Random House, Penguin, Faber &#038; Faber, Bloomsbury and Simon &#038; Schuster.It comes with the features you&#8217;d expect like recommended reading lists, book clubs etc.It has over two million ebooks to choose from, including thousands of free-to-download ebooks, and a UK bestseller list priced at Â£8.99 or less.So Kobo&#8217;s platform-agnostic approach, large catalogue and big partners should position it well.Watch out Amazon.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Evernote, a great Web service that enables people to capture and store information, memories, and content in various environments, this morning announced the availability of an Evernote SmartSolution app for three of Lexmark&#8217;s inkjet printers: Interact, Prestige and Platinum. The Evernote SmartSolution application basically allows users to send hardcopy scans from these Lexmark devices straight into their Evernote Web account with the touch of a single button, computer not required.The Evernote application was developed by Lexmark, and a shortcut to the service can be added to the printer touch screens in a matter of minutes. After setup, tapping the Evernote application can send scans to pre-configured Evernote accounts over the Web.At the end of last year, venture capital backed Evernote had about 2 million people using its service, and its conceivable that only a small subset of those actually own one of those Lexmark printers. That said, I like the idea of being able to manage Web services on devices other than computers and phones.Now can they please hook up my fridge?    CrunchBase Information',\n",

The company had earlier raised $6 million from Northbridge Venture Partners, but $2 million of the Series A round (raised in October 2009) was converted to Series B terms as part of the deal. Thus, this round brings the total of financing for the company to $12 million.Currensee allows members of its trader network to see each other&#8217;s trades and positions, strategies and performance in real-time, enabling them to make more informed decisions. The company says its network boasts traders from over 70 different countries, and that its platform supports over 100 brokers. The company recently launched Currensee Marketplace, released full MT4 support, a Tweet My Trades feature and a partnership with Thomson Reuters IFR Markets.With the financing, Currensee will accelerate expansion in the UK, Europe, and Asia, where Forex trading is said to be growing at a rapid pace. Part of the additional capital will also be used for the development of Currensee Market Watch, a real-time &#8220;social sentiment indicator&#8221; that aims to show what traders are doing based on actual trades.To a degree, the company competes with StockTwits, which has raised $4.6 million to date.(Via press release and company blog post)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The rapid evolution of mobile phones, both on a hardware and a software level, combined with a surge in application storefront releases, deployments of higher-capacity network infrastructure and recent developments in positioning technologies could drive revenues from mobile location-based services to more than $12.7 billion by 2014, according to a new report published by Juniper Research.The report found that while MLBS had experienced a number of false dawns from 2000 to 2007, improvements in handset UIs together with easier consumer access to an range of app distribution channels had led to greater interest from service providers in providing mobile location-based applications. While service usage will be highest in Far East China over the next few years, greatest revenues will come from Western Europe, Juniper forecasts.Revenues will come from sales of apps through application stores and other channels, but also from mobile advertising tied to those apps. In fact, the Juniper report notes that advertising will likely form an increasing share of MLBS-related revenues over the next five years. In the words of co-author Dr Windsor Holden:â\\x80\\x9cLocation-based applications are extremely interesting for brands and retailers in that they allow those companies to direct consumers to outlets in their vicinity while simultaneously providing information about the products on offer. When these are allied to measures such as mobile coupons and vouchers, you have the combination of information and financial incentive which can be compelling for consumers.â\\x80\\x9dThis should sound like music in the ears of juggernauts like Google, Facebook and Nokia, as well startups like Foursquare, Gowalla, aka-aki, Loopt, Rummble and a couple of hundred others playing this extremely crowded field.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Apple&#8217;s hypocrisy with regard to the App Store is something I know well. Several times last year I wrote about Apple allowing apps like &#8220;Asian Boobs&#8221; and upskirt apps into the App Store while rejecting things such asÂ\\xa0satirical apps that mocked public figures. It was ridiculous. So you might think I&#8217;d be happy that Apple is now rejecting and removing sexy apps from the App Store as well. But actually, the hypocrisy is much worse now.Problem number one is that while Apple is removing most of these sexy apps from the App Store, it&#8217;s not removing all of them. So who gets to stay? Big publishers like Sports Illustrated and Playboy. In fact, not only is Sports Illustrated&#8217;s Swimsuit 2010 app not being removed, it&#8217;s being featured in the App Store. Both it and the Playboy app clearly violate the new rules of the more prudish App Store, yet they get to stay. Why?As Apple VP of Worldwide Product Marketing Phil Schiller explained earlier to the New York Times, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re well-known companies known for that content. Yet, he also cited women being upset about feeling degraded and parents being upset about kids having access to sexy apps as the main reason Apple is cracking down on them. The omission of the fact that parents probably also don&#8217;t want their kids downloading the Playboy app, or that some women might also find the Swimsuit app degrading is laughable.Now, are some apps worse than others with regard to sexy content? Of course. But Apple has removed over 5,000 apps and counting under these new rules â\\x80\\x94 surely some of those would likely be considered less offensive then the Playboy app. Further, this is creating the ultimate gray line when it comes to what is and what is not permissible in the App Store. For example, what if there&#8217;s a smaller publication also known for nude pictures that wants to make a lingerie app? Will Apple reject or accept that? Is there a certain circulation threshold one has to have to be considered &#8220;well-known&#8221; in Schiller&#8217;s words?Problem number two is that Apple is breaking a golden rule: don&#8217;t take away what you&#8217;ve already given (in this case, to both developers and users). Apple has not always allowed these sexy apps in the App Store. But at some point over the past several months they changed their minds and apps like &#8220;Asian Boobs&#8221; started getting accepted. Why did they do it? At the time, the thought was that with the new parental controls in the iPhone OS 3.0, they could leave it up to parents to decide what their children can or cannot download/use.Apple was probably happy to let another huge rush of apps into the store, while yes, generating revenue off of them. Meanwhile, this spawned a wave of developers who were making these types of apps. Several of those developers have reached out to us over the past few days basically saying that Apple has just destroyed their businesses. Again, businesses that these people would not have created without Apple approving these apps in the first place. Apple giveth, Apple taketh away.Problem number three is related to number two. I fail to see the reason that Apple built parental controls into the iPhone OS if they weren&#8217;t to be used for situations like this. Why even bother? For games with violence? Please. I&#8217;m all for kids not having access to mature content if their parents are against it, but that&#8217;s exactly what these controls are made for.So why is Apple making this big change that is pissing a lot of people off if they have this safeguard in place? Clearly, they must not trust it. But if that&#8217;s the case, why not remove the explicit content from iTunes? After all, the parental controls for apps are in the exact same place as the ones from music, movies, and TV shows.Problem number four is perhaps my favorite one. Apple is going through all this trouble of removing these apps, and creating more work in scanning for the next sexy apps to reject, when built into every iPhone and iPod touch is not one, but two huge entry points for explicit material â\\x80\\x94 and both are apps made by Apple themselves. The first, I alluded to above: iTunes. There are no shortage of films and TV shows with nudity and sexual content (along with violence and everything else) that are available on iTunes for purchase on the device. The same is true for explicit music.But the second app is far worse: Safari. Each iPhone and iPod touch has a web browser that is more than capable of accessing any site on the web with a few clicks. This includes sites with hardcore pornography, or anything else a teenage kid can dream up. Apple is going through all this trouble to block sexy apps (which have never contained nudity, by the way, just sexy pictures), when they offer one of their own that makes it much easier to find far more sinister content.Of course, if they removed Safari, it could well destroy the iPhone. So they&#8217;re not going to do that.The sad truth is that while everyone can clearly see Apple&#8217;s hypocrisy here, it&#8217;s unlikely to matter. Just as with all the hoopla over the Google Voice app rejection, this too will blow over. As long as people keep voting for Apple with their pocketbooks, Apple will continue to do as it pleases, hypocrisy or not.The lesson, I suppose, is that killer products give you carte blanche.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Online productivity suite Zoho has been open to allowing users to use their Google, Google Apps and Yahoo accounts to log-in to Zoho Apps. Zoho says that most of its users are using their log-ins for other applications to use Zoho&#8217;s offerings. Today, the productivity suite is adding a social layer to its suite by integrating the ability to login with Facebook Connect.Similar to its integration with Google apps, Zoho users can login to Zoho using their Facebook credentials. Users with existing Zoho accounts can now link the two accounts so that they can login with Facebook credentials alone. But the plus of using Facebook Connect now allows Zoho to transcend platforms. So  you can now share documents with Facebook users who don&#8217;t have a Zoho Account. Of course this isn&#8217;t Zoho&#8217;s first foray into Facebook&#8217;s territory. Zoho&#8217;s Facebook app allows users to create documents, spreadsheets and presentations from within Facebook and includes the ability to view and edit all existing documents, spreadsheets and presentations (both personal and shared) from Zoho Writer, Sheet and Show.Of course, you can add a social layer to Google Apps, a competitor of sorts to Zoho, with Socialwok. But the plus of using Zoho&#8217;s applications is that suite ties into its other productivity applications seamlessly. And Zoho is affordable, with a free version of the suite. Last year, we wrote that Zoho has continued to implement an intelligent strategy to launch new products and add-ons to its existing offerings, partly to keep users from flocking to Google Apps and Microsoft&#8217;s Web-based version of Microsoft 2010.  It looks like Zoho is continuing this strategy in 2010. The adoption of Facebook Connect makes sense for a number of reasons. First, productivity apps in the enterprise are naturally becoming more social. Second, Facebook, with 400 million users, could bring more traffic to Zoho. Last year, startup unveiled a new version of  Zoho Reports; launched a deeper integration with Google Docs;  rolled out Zoho Discussions, a online forum tool for businesses; and debuted Zoho Recruit.  And over the past two years, Zoho has added support for Sharepoint,  mobile, Google and Yahoo IDs and group sharing. According to out latest states, Zoho has definitely reached over 2 million users  is even catching the attention of its competition. CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'On Thursday 8 January 2009, then 18-year old Mahoud Samed Almahadin (aka Matt Connor aka Agent Pubeit) took off his shirt, proceeded to rub vaseline all over his upper body and subsequently used it to hold toenail clippings and pubic hair. He then ran into the New York Scientology building, tossed some books around and smeared the mixture on objects. After his greasy raid, Mahoud Samed Almahadin was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Weeks later, 21 year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with the same crimes, bar burglary, because he had filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank (video below).This morning, the Church of Scientology put out a press release, rejoicing the fact that Almahadin apparently pled guilty in the New York City Criminal Court.Savvy surfers will correctly assume Almahadin is a &#8216;member&#8217; of the Anonymous collective, a loosely organized movement of sorts among Internet users often associated with message boards 4chan and Futaba. Anonymous often triggers actions against the Church of Scientology, among other organizations or individuals, both in real life and on the Web.Here&#8217;s the Church of Scientology&#8217;s take on the guilty plea:According to court documents, Anonymous is an underground hate group that, in addition to the cyber attack, targeted Churches of Scientology and members with death threats, bomb threats and fake anthrax mail. In addition to Scientology Churches and the Prime Minister of Australia, Anonymous has also targeted The Epilepsy Foundation, hip-hop music websites and others.Now that he has plead guilty, Almahadin will be forced to stand on the digital sidelines in Anonymous&#8217; actions against the Church of Scientology: as part of his plea, he is required to stay away from the organization for the next five years.Somehow, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll mind that.

       "  'comments_content': 'We&#8217;re big fans of Mobile Roadie, a startup that helps develop iPhone apps. But the one gripe we had was that Mobile Roadie was limited to the iPhone platform. Today, our wish came true as Mobile Roadie is launching functionality for Android phones.The beauty of Mobile Roadieâ\\x80\\x99s platform is that it offers a dead simple mostly-automated system to build apps and have them posted to Appleâ\\x80\\x99s App Store in as little as a week. Launched earlier this year, the startup develops mobile apps for other conferences, events, and venues, as well as musicians, athletes, politicians, and other celebrities. The apps can provide users with access to news, music, live and recorded video, photos, event listings, and more. The apps also feature integration with YouTube, Brightcove, Flickr, Twitpic, Ustream, Topspin, Google News, RSS, Twitter, and Facebook. Another bonus of Mobile Roadie&#8217;s platform is that its CMS allows users to simultaneously make updates to both their iPhone and Android Apps. And using push notifications, customers can send alerts that appear on usersâ\\x80\\x99 screens, geo targeting messages down to a one-mile radius. With the launch of Google Android support, Mobile Roadie will be powering both iPhone and Android apps for Ashton Kutcher, Dolly Parton, and Madonna. We hear Taylor Swift will be launching apps soon as well. Mobile Roadie also developed the official iPhone app for LeWeb, the foremost European technology conference organized by French entrepreneur and Seesmic founder, Loic Le Meur and his wife, Geraldine. The app was a huge hit at the conference. Mobile Roadie also recently struck a deal with Random House  to power iPhone apps for authors. There&#8217;s no doubt that Mobile Roadie&#8217;s functionality for Android platforms will make its platform more attractive to users. And the ability to simultaneously manage your iPhone and Android apps through one interface is a compelling feature. With Mobile Roadie&#8217;s track record of success over the past year, we&#8217;ll continue to expect more innovations to be produced from the bootstrapped startup in the near future.

       "  'comments_content': 'Google Buzz is now two weeks old. I decided to hold off on writing about it (beyond my overview on launch day), until I had a solid amount of time to play with it and gather my thoughts. Now I have. And now I will.My reasoning for holding off is pretty simple: I was confused. For the first few hours I was sure it was the best thing ever. Then I was certain it was the worst thing ever. The truth, not surprisingly, is likely somewhere in the middle. Google Buzz is a service with a ton of potential, but the execution of it is so bad right now, that&#8217;s it&#8217;s at points completely unusable.I&#8217;m not going to go into the privacy implications of it, because those have already been discussed ad-nauseum. And while plenty of them certainly seem valid, I&#8217;m just thinking about Buzz from a pure product perspective.First, the bad:These entire two weeks, one problem has stood out above all others to me with Buzz: when people set the service to automatically import tweets and FriendFeed messages, Buzz collects them in bulk and spews them into your Buzz stream only once ever few hours (and sometimes once a day). If you happen to follow a person who imports either of these and is even just moderately prolific on either service, it leads to a Buzz stream that is ridiculously overrun by one contact.Earlier today for example, one of my contacts had 30 messages in a row from FriendFeed import at the exact same time. So in order to see anything else on Buzz, I had to scroll below these 30 messages. Sure, I could mute them (and for some I did), but that takes way too long to do. And the reality is, you shouldn&#8217;t have to do that. This is just poor execution.And it&#8217;s one thing if this happens once, but it happens multiple times a day. The same exact thing happened just hours after that one incident, but with tweets instead of FriendFeed messages â\\x80\\x94 over 20 of them instantly instantly overtook my Buzz stream. It renders the service completely unusable unless you unsubscribe from that user â\\x80\\x94 how&#8217;s that for a social network? One that works best the less social it is.But that seems to be the case. Google has been testing the product internally for a few months, and a few Googlers have noted that in their longer experience with the site, they&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s best to only follow a handful of people and let Buzz&#8217;s algorithms do the rest of the work to find you content you&#8217;ll be interested in. Again, it&#8217;s a social network where it&#8217;s better to be less social. Odd.Currently, I&#8217;m following just 79 people of the over 1,500 that follow me â\\x80\\x94 I&#8217;d like to follow more, but I know it will just make my Buzz experience worse (because I was and had to cut a bunch out). In fact, I could probably do with half the noise I currently see, so maybe I should cut some of those 79 as well. That really seems to be the only way to make it manageable right now.As far as I can tell, even after two weeks of muting, liking, and commenting quite a bit, I&#8217;m not seeing the service tailor itself to my needs. Google promised this would be a big part of it, but if it&#8217;s doing it, it&#8217;s not doing it well enough â\\x80\\x94 to the point where I need them to actually tell me in what way they&#8217;re doing it.Basically, Buzz needs to become FriendFeed. From the moment I first saw it, I thought it was FriendFeed â\\x80\\x94 and it kind of is, but minus all of the good filtering, social recommendation, and stacking options. For example, in FriendFeed, I can not only just mute an item, I can mute just a certain type of item just from a certain user. I&#8217;d love to do that for the aforementioned people&#8217;s tweets and FriendFeed items. Also, FriendFeed does a far superior job of bunching together similar items if you import a lot of them at once. So, for example, those 20+ tweets would have been condensed to one or two with a link to &#8220;18 more like this&#8221; which you could click to expand if you wanted to see them.Speaking of click to expand, that&#8217;s something else Buzz needs to utilize better immediately. When I see I have new Buzz unread items, I expect them to be big entries, not comments. So when I click on the Buzz tab and see 100 new comments that I must scroll through to get to another item, I&#8217;m annoyed. The comments, while often interesting, are just meant to supplement the content they are talking about. Instead, they completely overwhelm the original message. Buzz likes to show me all the comments for any item I&#8217;ve expanded just once. By default, Buzz needs to collapse all but maybe the top and bottom comments each time, with the option to click to see the rest. You know, just like FriendFeed does.I don&#8217;t see how Buzz could so closely copy many of FriendFeed&#8217;s features but leave out the vital part: the filtering. Without it, FriendFeed would just be a bunch of noise as well. That&#8217;s the nature of importing social data from a variety of sites â\\x80\\x94 it&#8217;s about taking a lot of content and presenting it in a way that&#8217;s manageable. Right now, Buzz is failing badly at that. And just imagine if they add more auto-import options (FriendFeed has dozens) â\\x80\\x94 it will be totally out of control.Frankly, I think Buzz should completely disable the auto-importing of tweets, FriendFeed items, and anything else they cannot pull in in realtime until they are able to. That&#8217;s another key area Buzz misses the boat on. FriendFeed works with Twitter because it is real-time importing tweets (and when that was broken, I quit using it). When Buzz imports tweets in bunches (or even just late), they&#8217;re pretty much useless across-the-board. They&#8217;re just noise.And that&#8217;s what Google Buzz is right now, noise. If that&#8217;s what they were going for with the name, it worked.But wait, the good:Okay, now that I&#8217;ve slammed Buzz for what I see as fundamental flaws that make it unusable for most of the time in its current state. I&#8217;ll talk about what I actually do like about it â\\x80\\x94 and make no mistake, there are things, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t care about the poor execution.Hands down, the best thing Buzz has going for it is the usage. It&#8217;s huge. Because they crammed it into Gmail, Buzz has likely already been exposed to way more users than FriendFeed ever was. The big knock against FriendFeed was always that it was the coolest service no one was using. Google Buzz can be the FriendFeed that everyone is using.A number of items from popular users are regularly getting over 100 comments, and hundreds of &#8220;likes.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m always in Gmail, I find myself checking it quite often, even despite my aforementioned problems. Further, while some people are annoyed with Buzz messages showing up in their inbox, I find the fact that you can respond to them right from there very, very useful. The fact that you can reply to buzzes over IM is also very interesting. I still believe Google is onto something very smart with this Buzz integration within Gmail (again, it just needs to make Buzz itself better).Buzz also does a great job of making it quick and easy to share. The box at the top of the service works well, and I particularly like that when you paste a link in, you can easily select which pictures from the site to include in the buzz. The idea of private buzzing at first seemed silly to me because you have to create a group, until I realized that if I wanted to message just one person, I could use IM or even email within Gmail as well. While I&#8217;m not yet using it, it does seem like private group buzzing could be useful.But probably my favorite part of Buzz is the mobile version. The web app is very well made, and handles elements like location well (and makes much more sense right now than Google&#8217;s other location product, Latitude). On Android phones, Buzz is even better when you use it on the Google Maps app. It&#8217;s also very cool to see on a map where other buzzes are coming from.Okay, so there was more bad:Yes, Google Buzz needs a lot of work in my opinion. To be honest, I think they should just finish the job and more completely emulate everything about FriendFeed. FriendFeed was a great service, but once Facebook acquired the team, it became more of a ghost town then some already thought it was. But there still is a need for this type of service in my opinion, and I&#8217;m positive that Google Buzz can be it. (That is, unless Facebook, with theirÂ\\xa0secret messaging project, beats them to it.)While Google will never admit it, it seems pretty clear the product was shoved out the door prematurely. The mad rush to make changes and the blog posts with tips on how to use it prove that. It definitely should have launched in Gmail Labs, where these kinks could be ironed out amongst a more understanding early-adopter crowd. Instead, Google clearly wanted to go from zero to social in four seconds flat. Unfortunately, they forgot to install seat belts.

       "  'comments_content': 'It took them four days, but Apple is finally explaining its surprise decision to remove nearly all &#8220;sexy&#8221; content from the App Store.  Once again, the morsels of information come from Apple SVP of Worldwide Product Marketing Phil Schiller, who spoke with the New York Times for an article published earlier this evening.  None of it is too surprising, but Schiller&#8217;s unconvincing explanation as to why some applications like Sports Illustrated&#8217;s swimsuit app and Playboy will be allowed to remain on the store is sure to anger plenty of developers.So why did Apple decide to pull these sexy apps?&#8220;It came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading and objectionable, as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see&#8221;Which makes sense given the broad appeal of the iPhone, but Apple should have seen this coming, and it implemented parental controls for a reason.  And then Schiller goes on to pour salt into the wounds of recently spurned developers with his explanation as to why a select few sexy applications will remain on the App Store.&#8220;When asked about the Sports Illustrated app, Mr. Schiller said Apple took the source and intent of an app into consideration. â\\x80\\x9cThe difference is this is a well-known company with previously published material available broadly in a well-accepted format,â\\x80\\x9d he said.&#8221;So apparently exposed cleavage in a Playboy application is less offensive to women and parents because it&#8217;s also being printed in a magazine, or something.  The decision really isn&#8217;t all that surprising, either â\\x80\\x94 there&#8217;s little risk of the Playboy application trying to sneak in some extreme nudity, and with only a handful of mainstream sexy apps there&#8217;s much less clutter.  Still, such favoritism sets another bad precedent for the App Store, and Schiller&#8217;s explanation just feels lame.Of course, if you&#8217;re still looking for &#8217;sexy&#8217; content on your iPhone, you can still find plenty of nudity in iTunes (Apple has no problem selling R rated movies).  Or you could just pop open Safari.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Email overload is a pain for many reasons, but above all, the worst thing about an overstuffed inbox is the fact that you sometimes miss messages you shouldn&#8217;t have, or you forget to keep in touch with the people who are important to you.  If you&#8217;ve run into these issues before, a new Y Combinator-funded startup called Etacts might be exactly what you&#8217;re looking for.Etacts is similar in some ways to CRMs like Highrise andÂ\\xa0SalesForce, but founders Evan Beard and Howie Liu say they&#8217;re focusing on helping people stay in touch, rather than on teams looking to complete sales.  The service&#8217;s home screen features a list of people you know, ranked by how often you communicate with them via Email or phone. The list includes information like the total number of times you&#8217;re interacted with each person and when you first began talking with them online.  Most important, it lets you know how long it&#8217;s been since you last contacted them, and lets you set regular reminders â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0if you go too long without talking to someone, the service will send you an alert.To start using Etacts, you enter your email account login credentials (at the moment the service only works with Gmail or Google Apps, but support for any IMAP service provider is coming soon).  From there, Etacts will examine your inbox to automatically build out your list of important contacts, so you don&#8217;t have to do any work.  You can also optionally enter the credentials for your mobile carrier, which Etacts can use to track who you&#8217;ve talked to over the phone or have text messaged.The service can use this data to offer plenty of related features.  If you tell Etacts which of your contacts are especially important, it can automatically flag any new incoming messages.  The service offers a plugin for Google Chrome and Firefox that adds a new button to Gmail&#8217;s interface: &#8220;Send and Remind Me&#8221;.  Hit that, and you&#8217;ll send the message and automatically add a reminder to your Etacts account.  If too many days go by without receiving a response, Etacts will remind you to resend your message (or to ask your contact what&#8217;s up).And, if you really want to pump out your correspondence, you can turn to Etact&#8217;s message sending feature.  This allows you to build templates of messages you commonly send, with variables for each person&#8217;s name.  It&#8217;s essentially a mail merge, but it makes it easy to manually tweak each message for each recipient â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you can construct 90% of the message from a template, and then add a personal touch yourself. You can get a feel for how you can modify the base message from this screenshot.I really like most of the features Etacts has to offer â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it&#8217;s straightforward enough that it didn&#8217;t take long at all to figure out how everything worked, and it seems like it would appeal to any professional that has to manage a sizable contact list.  My biggest gripe with the service is the fact that it requires users to hand over their email login credentials to Etacts.  The company only stores your Email headers (as opposed to the full message body), and I&#8217;m significantly more paranoid than your average consumer about this sort of thing, but other startups have had issues with this in the past.  For example, reMail (which was just acquired by Google) launched with Email search that was powered by its own servers, and then switched to a model where searches were done locally on the user&#8217;s mobile phone (so that credentials weren&#8217;t exchanged).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'After a lengthy legal face-off, Microsoft and European antitrust officials recently agreed on the implementation of a so-called ballot screen that will give European Windows users a chance to download rivals&#8217; browsers &#8211; including Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera &#8211; as possible alternatives to Redmond&#8217;s own Internet Explorer (see screenshot above or go here).Under the terms of the deal, Microsoft has agreed to provide a &#8220;ballot screen&#8221; to most European customers that will offer links to downloads of browsers offered by the company&#8217;s fiercest competitors when it comes to the Web browsing space, starting next week. The browser choice screen was designed to give all listed browsers a random order upon each new visit; antitrust regulators saw this as the right path to take to make European consumers more aware of alternative browsers to IE without favoring one over the other. But how random is the presentation of the browser on that ballot screen, really?That&#8217;s exactly what the good people behind Slovakian tech news site DSL.sk set out to discover, based on the current implementation and code found on www.browserchoice.eu. Their findings were quite interesting, as they seem to suggest that the selection isn&#8217;t really that random as one would imagine, and that Microsoft is not doing itself any favors at all, when in fact it may even be giving Google&#8217;s Chrome browser a bit of an edge.It took me some creative Google Translating to figure out how the team got to its conclusion, but finally a Skype chat with one of the reporters at DSL.sk cleared things up for me. The page on www.browserchoice.eu is static, running nothing but Javascript. The guys at DSL.sk basically automatically loaded that page tens of thousands of times, and they kept score of which browsers were shown in which order for each of those instances. And not only did they test this sufficiently on this page, but DSL.sk did the same for the core Javascript algorithm that triggers the random ordering.The test were run using Internet Explorer 8 on a Windows 7 machine, because the ballot screen will pop up in IE for users who install the relevant Windows Update and have set Microsoft&#8217;s browser as default.More than once out of every four hits, the page would show Google Chrome on the far left, and Internet Explorer would only make it to the first spot in 13,8% of page loads (scoring well below all four other browsers). In fact, in over 50% of all page hits, Internet Explorer would come out to the far right spot of the five browser choices shown on the screen. Here&#8217;s a table with the stats &#8211; the titles are in Slovakian but are simply indicating the order of the browser and its average position in the right column:What&#8217;s most apparent is that Google Chrome scored &#8216;best&#8217; out of five for all 3 first spots on the browser choice screen, and that Internet Explorer appeared on the far right way more than rival browsers. We should note that this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean there&#8217;s a conspiracy going on &#8211; perhaps tens of thousands of hits are simply not enough to produce relevant results, or the results are skewed for a different reason. DSL, for one, claims the test results are quite stable and don&#8217;t seem to alter much when the number of loads keeps on increasing.Be that as it may, it&#8217;s also worth noting that the &#8216;first spot&#8217; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s also the &#8216;best spot&#8217; &#8211; eye movement research could well conclude that the middle, far right or any other of the spots is actually the most beneficial one.For what it&#8217;s worth, the DSL team says they had to make two minor changes to the code in order to run their tests mimicking the real behavior of the page as closely as possible, so theoretically the results could end up being more random than they appear based on the results cited above when the browser choice screen actually goes live. Also, different browsers produced different results, although it didn&#8217;t matter much whether IE6, IE7 or IE8 was used for testing. Tests were also run in Firefox, baring completely different results, although there was never an equal distribution between browsers whatsoever, so even then the &#8216;randomness&#8217; can be questioned.Do you think the selection on the browser choice screen will end up being completely random, or will more exhaustive research ultimately show that there&#8217;s a consistent pattern of browser selection happening here?(Hat tip to Patrik Hornik)CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In the summer of 2009 MySpace hired Katie Geminder, Facebook&#8217;s Director of User Experience and Design, as an SVP. Her primary job was to assemble a &#8220;swat team&#8221; of leading outside designers and user interface experts and re-imagine MySpace from the ground up. That team was made up of four people &#8211; including two former Apple designers and one ex-Facebooker &#8211; and worked out of a conference room in MySpace&#8217;s San Francisco offices for six months. They were creating a new site, located at remakingmyspace.com, and it was going to launch sometime right about now.RemakingMySpace was going to be a new version of MySpace with every piece of legacy stuff thrown out the door. Users and employees would be solicited for input &#8211; to get new ideas and vote on already submitted ones &#8211; to rebuild the service brick by brick. Most of the work over the last six months was spent reimagining the design in various ways that would be shown to users, and building tools for the submission and consideration of new ideas. And &#8220;users&#8221; was broadly defined to include input from artists and bands, advertisers, etc.It was bold, controversial and progressive, say some sources. And now it&#8217;s also very, very dead. Geminder left MySpace last week. And the guy who hired her, former CEO Owen Van Natta, was terminated the week before.So what happened? The project was trouble from the start. Geminder was strongly pushing the project, obviously, and had the support of Van Natta. But she was working outside of Chief Product Officer Jason Hirschhorn&#8217;s organization. Hirschhorn hated the idea from the start, say multiple sources, and constantly worked to undermine it. He favored a much more straightforward redesign effort. And, sources say, VP Product Mike Macadaan was also an outsider to the project, and strongly disapproved say of the whole process.None of that mattered as long as Van Natta was CEO and was able to push the project along. But once he was gone and Mike Jones and Hirschhorn took over as co-presidents, remakingmyspace was history. Within a day the team was dissolved and moved back into the product organization. The Apple designers, there as consultants, will likely be leaving shortly as their contracts expire.We&#8217;ve spoken with sources on both sides of this. Some say that the the consultants were way too expensive and Hirschhorn and Jones thought the pace of the project was too slow. One source said that almost no work was done at all, and that the team was often absent from the office. But others who knew about the project (the site was live for some MySpace employees) thought it was brilliant, and noted that six months wasn&#8217;t all that long for a project of this scope. There was genuine excitement within MySpace over remakingmyspace.com, and some are disgusted that it was all thrown away.One thing that strikes us as odd is the fact that the chief complaints &#8211; expense and time &#8211; were no longer relevant. The project was effectively done and the expense of it was behind them. &#8220;This was killed out of pure vindictiveness,&#8221; says one source. Another said that Hirschhorn never even bothered to really understand it, he just wanted it killed.So what comes next? A straightforward redesign that won&#8217;t rock the boat, says one source. Another says that many of the ideas from remakingmyspace will eventually make their way into whatever MySpace launches.  Officially, all MySpace will say is &#8220;The reimagination of MySpace&#8217;s user interface is a top priority. Under Jason Hirschhorn, VP of Product Mike Macadaan and his team are leading the charge to redesign the site and create a beautiful new and exciting environment for our users.&#8221;We&#8217;re now trying to track down and verify screen shots and the new logo for remakingmyspace.com. Stay tuned for updates. And in all fairness, unless and until we&#8217;ve seen some of the site for ourselves, there&#8217;s no way to know which &#8220;side&#8221; of the argument is right.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Google Trends is a great tool to get an overview on terms people are searching for with the largest search engine in the world. It also shows interesting trends. And something is definitely going on with searches for a few large social networks using Google.At some point in mid January, a group of sites including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, and Foursquare saw a huge drop in number of searches for their domains. Now, to be clear, these are only searches for the .com names, for example, &#8220;facebook.com&#8221; and &#8220;youtube.com&#8221; and not just the terms &#8220;facebook&#8221; and &#8220;youtube&#8221; themselves. Still, across the board, traffic had been rising for these .com domains and then at the same time all dropped off a cliff.One might think this has to do with the China situation (Google warned it might have to pull out of China after saying it would remove previous restraints on searches). But drilling down into the data shows that while the searches from China did take a big fall, they did as well from other countries around the world too.Other sites saw drops as well, but by far these large social sites saw the most pronounced drops that all seem to be aligned. Weirdly, google.com did not see any drop (though I&#8217;m not sure who uses Google to google google.com).We&#8217;ve reached out to Google for some clarification or insight into this and will update when we hear back. The logical answer would seem to be that they switched something in mid-January that led to these huge drops in social site searches on Google, but who knows.Â\\xa0Maybe we have a wild honey bee extinction situation going on here within Google.Update: Google&#8217;s ownÂ\\xa0Orkut.com also seeing a drop.

The round was led by Institutional Venture Partners, and existing shareholders Kleiner Perkins, Norwest Venture Parters, and Maples Investments also participated.  The new round brings the total raised to $40.6 million.  The startup consistently pumps out new iPhone games which have been downloaded millions of times.  Two of its games aloneâ\\x80\\x94TouchPets and Eliminateâ\\x80\\x94have been installed 9 million times, and hundreds of thousands of people play every day.  Last year, ngmoco switched to free-to-play games with in-app purchases for virtual goods through its Plus+ social game network.  All of Freeverse&#8217;s games, such as Skee-Ball, Flick Fishing, Flick Bowling, and Moto Chaser, are paid apps.   Skee-Ball is the No. 4 ranked paid app in the App Store.  But Young plans to move the Freeverse games over to the free-to-play model, and then make money off in-app purchases.  Young also acquired the $0.99 game Charadium from another game developer and plans to convert that over to free-to-play as well.The model is working well for ngmoco.  Young says TouchPets had &#8220;its biggest revenue day&#8221; last weekend, and its next two games, We Rule and GodFinger (a &#8220;social god game&#8221;), were designed specifically with the free-to-play model in mind.  &#8220;On any given day, you have about 2% of your audience paying you money,&#8221; he says.  He expects ngmoco to put out about about 20 new games this year, and the newly-acquired Freeverse team to nearly match that.  In addition to rolling out wave after wave of new iPhone games, Young also plans to open up an SDK to ngmoco&#8217;s Plus+ system so that other developers can more easily tap into it.  The Plus+ system can manage virtual goods payments, player-to-player messaging, and other social aspects of iPhone games.  CrunchBase Information',\n",

Some of Asad&#8217;s finger taps don&#8217;t seem to register properly (though he admits to not knowing how to play, so he wasn&#8217;t always clicking in the right places).  But even if the game worked perfectly, the small screen size clearly isn&#8217;t ideal â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0you&#8217;re forced to constantly pan and zoom to get anything done.  That said, the application did appear to run pretty smoothly on the Nexus One&#8217;s Snapdragon processor.    Given these issues, I suspect developers behind popular Flash applications will build versions that are optimized for mobile form factors.  And while these Flash apps won&#8217;t work in the browser on the iPhone, developers should be able to bundle them into native applications using Adobe CS5&#8217;s export tool.Update: Adobe says that the Flash player running on the phone is an upgraded version of Flash Lite 3, not Flash Player 10.1 (which will be released later this year:At Mobile World Congress Adobe demonstrated the full Flash Player (Flash Player 10.1) running on Android, Palm webOS and other mobile platforms.  The HTC Desire will support Flash Player 10.1 once the runtime is available in the first half of 2010.  Users will be able to upgrade the free player over the air.  Until then the HTC Desire will ship with a new version of Flash Lite that supports ActionScript 3, and other new features.  The Farmville demo shown on Redmondpie is using Flash Lite, not the full Flash Player.Given that most of my issues with the app have to do with user interaction rather than performance, I&#8217;m hoping Flash 10.1 will play nicer with Flash apps that aren&#8217;t optimized for a mobile form factor.Note: If you want to try this yourself it&#8217;s possible to install the early ROM to your own Nexus One, but you may well run into some major bugs â\\x80\\x94 this isn&#8217;t something for the faint of heart (yet).CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Twitter is now processing 50 million Tweets a day, which comes to about 1.5 billion Tweets a month.  Royal Pingdom recently reported that Twitter passed one billion Tweets a month last December and measured about 1.2 billion in January.  On a daily basis, Royal Pindom was measuring 27 million Tweets a day back in November, 2009.  But the latest data comes from Twitter itself (after attempting to strip out spam Tweets).In January, comScore estimated that Twitter.com attracted almost 75 million unique visitors worldwide.  But the number of messages going across Twitter is perhaps a more useful metric because it cuts across all third-party Twitter clients as well.  At its most fundamental level, Twitter is a communications service, and 50 million messages a day is certainly a healthy number.  What Twitter doesn&#8217;t say is how many of its users are responsible for those 50 million Tweets, or on average how many Tweets a day comes from each user. I&#8217;d love to see the distribution of Tweets across heavy, medium, and light users.How many of those 50 million Tweets come from the top 10 percent of users?  It seems to me that even though I follow more than 300 people on Twitter, I hear from the same 20 to 30 blabbermouths every day.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The startup just raised $12 million from Sequoia Capital and also expanded its operations to Silicon Valley with a new Palo Alto office. The company said in a statement that the new CEO will be helping Jive continue on its growth trajectory. But Jive may be also facing the heat from Saleforce&#8217;s venture into the social enterprise space with Chatter. While Chatter is still in private beta, Salesforce&#8217;s application is eliciting a lot of buzz in the enterprise world. Unfortunately, Salesforce is limiting its beta users so its unclear how much of a threat it will be to the existing social offerings in the marketplace, but its potential threat to Jive&#8217;s marketshare is sure to be on the company&#8217;s mind at the moment.

One of the new rules is no more bikini apps, unless you happen to be Sports Illustrated (or FHM or Playboy).  Sports Illustrated, for instance, just released its 2010 Swimsuit app on iTunes on February 9, before the ban really started.  The SI Swimsuit app is filled with pictures of bikini-clad models.    If you fire up iTunes right now, you will see the SI Swimsuit app being promoted on the main App Store homepage.  It is currently the No. 1 Sports app, the No. 13 free app, and the No. 35 Top Grossing app (you have to pay $1.99 to unlock all the free photos and videos).

       "  'comments_content': 'Following the disastrous earthquake in Haiti earlier this year, a number of web companies have been setting up special programs to try and do their part to help. Twitter has been one of the most active, as the company has made great use of its social graph to get the word out on how to help through donations and other means. Now they&#8217;ve done something else.Twitter was able to strike a deal with Digicel to bring free SMS tweets to Haitian citizens (who use that carrier). Previously, people in the country would be charged a messaging fee each time they tweeted, so obviously this will help them communicate with the outside world a little easier. And it&#8217;s very simple to set use even if you don&#8217;t have a Twitter account yet. As co-founder Biz Stone writes today on the company blog:To activate the service, mobile phone users in Haiti can text follow @oxfam to 40404. Accounts are created on the fly and any account can be followed this way.Stone credits Twitter mobile lead Kevin Thau with striking the deal. He&#8217;s also been the one behind similar deals in several countries around the world such as India, the UK, and others. This is part of Twitter&#8217;s broader plan to go back to its SMS roots to enable people around the world without broadband access or smartphones to use Twitter easily.CrunchBase Information',\n",

DubMeNow (&#8220;Dub&#8221; for short) is a real business, he implies, and he can prove it. Dub has been on a tear the last few months in all aspects of their business. They&#8217;ve got real revenue: over $2.7M projected for this fiscal year. They&#8217;ve raised over $2.8 million in funding thus far, led by Syncom Ventures with other undisclosed angel investors participating. Furthermore, they have found traction in the education market and are soon-to-be deployed to over 750 Universities as a contact-sharing option for students.Their mobile application, DubMeNow, has been downloaded nearly 1 million times &#8211; still dwarfed by the 7 million of their Y Combinator- and Sequoia-funded competitor, Bump. Bump and Dub are in a battle to become the de facto contact information-sharing application for mobile phones. Bump is clearly kicking ass in terms of users, and much of that is due to the love they&#8217;ve gotten from Apple and through PR. But Manoj doesn&#8217;t care &#8211; he argues that real revenue and partnerships are going to serve Dub better in the long-term. That statement may be suspect, but there&#8217;s no doubt that Dub is making headway.Recently, Dub has created partnerships with DataTel and Moodle. DataTel is the 3rd largest ERP vendor for universities. Together, the two partnerships mean that over 1,000 universities will have access to Dub&#8217;s platform as a way of sharing contacts among students and faculty. Furthermore, they&#8217;ve announced partnerships with SXSW and Higher Logic, as a way for conference-goers to share information easily.Dub was founded 19 months ago by a group of engineers who wanted to create a platform for users to share contact information. Their major product, originally available only on iPhone, launched less than 1 year ago. Founder and CEO Manoj Ramnani came to the US pursuing an MBA at George Washington University, and recently sold a mobile software services company.Mobile business cards is a real problem and I definitely want to see some company &#8211; whether it be Dub or Bump &#8211; succeed. I&#8217;m sick of carrying around wads of paper in my pocket every time I go to an event, and then fumbling through the stack to figure out the e-mail address of that one person I want to talk to. That said, there&#8217;s a long way to go before we as a community standardize on one application &#8211; and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see which one becomes successful.CrunchBase Information',\n",

They make you go through page after page of names in no real order (other than how recently you added them). If you want to remove some people you followed years ago, it&#8217;s a huge pain. Seesmic has just made a much better way.The new Seesmic Web app, launching today, brings with it a new main tab: Contacts. As you can guess, this is a contact manager for Twitter that makes pruning your Twitter contacts a breeze. It also gives you plenty of other interesting information about your followers, those who follow you, and all your Twitter Lists, on the fly. For example, for each person you can not only see all their Twitter profile information, but also their Twitter stats from MrTweet which tell you how often they tweet and who they contact the most (publicly) on Twitter.And all of this is wrapped up in a way that looks very similar to Google&#8217;s contact manager that is built into Gmail, so it should be familiar to many of you. But it&#8217;s actually better because they show Twitter icons next to each users name, which is an easy way to sort through people.Another new contact management feature Seesmic Web has added is the ability to drag and drop any user to add them to a list. Again, this is about 1,000 times easier than doing it on Twitter.com. As you might imagine, Seesmic Web also now has the ability to make, delete and alter Twitter Lists.Other new features include better conversation threading (if you click on the &#8220;in reply to&#8221; portion below a tweet, you&#8217;ll see an overlay with the entire back-and-forth). Also new is Tweetmeme retweet data for each link in a tweet. Simply click on the &#8220;+&#8221; button next to a link to see an overlay with that data (including a text snippet and image). The ability to upload pictures directly from the app, and tag tweets with your geolocation (assuming you&#8217;re using something like Google Gears that can add that to the browser) has also been added. Other, smaller UI tweaks have been made as well.With the addition of Retweets and Lists over the past few months, Twitter.com has become a very useful client itself once again. But other web-based Twitter clients like Brizzly and Seesmic Web clearly believe they can still do a better job than Twitter itself. And with this contact management system, Seesmic Web just gave me a definite excuse to start using it.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Local cost-per-click marketplace Reply.com wants to raise $60 million in an initial public offering.  The company filed its offering statement with the SEC this morning.Reply.com is a cost-per-click ad network which targets ads for local businesses.  Its strategy is to gather more information from consumers who click on their ads by inserting a &#8220;middle page&#8221; between that pops to ask them where they live or what brands they like to improve targeting before showing them an ad.Revenues rose 75 percent in 2009 to $32.6 million.  The company operates with a 50 percent gross margin, and turned its first net profit in 2009 of $2.5 million.  The business produced $4.7 million in cash flow in 2009, but it ended the year with only $1.3 million in cash.  Reply.com acquires click traffic from search engines, display ad networks, and other sources.  These traffic acquisition costs account for nearly all of its cost of revenue.  In the fourth quarter alone, the generated 4.9 million &#8220;enhanced clicks&#8221; and 700,000 leads for 5,000 advertisers. The company employs 127 peopleâ\\x80\\x94103 of them in sales and marketing.Since 2005, the company has raised $27.5 million from Scale Venture Partners, Outlook Ventures, ATEL Ventures, and Debi Coleman, a former CFO of Apple.  CEO Payam Zamani is the largest stockholder.  He owns 43 percent of shares outstanding (before the offering).  Scale is the second largest shareholder, with 21.5 percent.Zamani was previously the co-founder of Autoweb, and he&#8217;s been bankrolling the Reply.com.  Over the past two years, the company has been dipping into his personal lines of credit to improve its liquidity.  According to the filing, the &#8220;aggregate principal amount that we repaid under these credit lines to Mr. Zamani through December 31, 2009 was $5.9 million.&#8221;  All of this personal debt to the CEO was repaid as of December 31, 2009, but it does suggest one reason why the company may need more working capital.  It also plans to use the proceeds to expand into new advertising categories and geographies (and, presumably, to hire more sales peopleâ\\x80\\x94local ad plays are very sales intensive).Click on the tables below to see its consolidated income statement.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Update: looks like he&#8217;ll be joining Technitrol as head honcho at the end of March 2010.Moloney will not be replaced, as Motorola co-CEO Sanjay Jha will continue to lead the previously announced combined Mobile Devices and Home businesses, as well as take the leadership role for the Home business, effective immediately.  Moloney served nearly 10 years in senior-level capacities at Motorola and, previously, 16 years in managerial positions at General Instrument Corporation before its acquisition by Motorola early in 2000.Since 2007 up until the recently announced reorganization, Dan Moloney ran Motorola&#8217;s Home &amp; Networks Mobility group. In that role, he reported to Greg Brown, Motorola&#8217;s other CEO, but with the reorganization Moloney effectively rolled into a position where he had to report to co-chief executive officer Sanjay Jha instead.When it became known that he&#8217;d be staying on as head of the Home business after the split-up, this was something of a surprise to some industry watchers. Premature, as it turns out, since it only took about 2 weeks after those reports for Moloney to hand in his resignation after all.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Simultaneously, the company announced that it has acquired Clear Sky Media, owner of a number of digital coupons and price comparison websites, for an undisclosed sum.The former agreement will enable YPG to build traffic for its own properties, Canada411.ca and YellowPages.ca, essentially leveraging the brand and growing reach of online directory 411.ca. Under the agreement, 411 Local Search will retain an exclusive license to use the 411.ca trademark until YPG purchases the balance of outstanding shares in the company within approx. three to five years. In a joint press release, 411.ca is said to have grown to attract close to 10% of online users, generating 13 million queries for local Canadian businesses each month. The addition of the 411.ca site will add approximately one million unduplicated unique visitors to YPG&#8217;s network reach, the companies added.The second acquisition that was announced by YPG this morning is that of Clear Sky Media, a holding company that operates RedFlagDeals and Scarlett Lounge, both community sites centered around discounts and coupons on the web and mobile, as well as price comparison engine PriceCanada.com.

       "  'comments_content': 'What do a trucker, an Israeli entrepreneur, Al Gore and Richard Branson all have in common? Proof that the real goldmines are old, neglected industries.The name of that proof is GreenRoad. While so many entrepreneurs bang their heads against a Web and social media advertising brick wall, GreenRoad has applied common technology to an industry technology has largely passed by andâ\\x80\\x94voilaâ\\x80\\x94theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got a business thatâ\\x80\\x99s growing and saving lives, money and the environment.Driving is the third most deadly profession after deep sea fishing and working in a coal mine. Not only does driving more safely save lives but research shows it can also save 10% on annual fuel costs, and alleviate a good chunk of the $230 billion professional fleets spend on crashes each year. Enter GreenRoad: a system that helps professional drivers drive more safely and as a result save their company a lot of money.The GreenRoad system looks simple from the outside: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a two-inch device on the dashboard that starts the day with a green light. If a driver brakes hard, swerves or turns recklessly, the light turns yellow. If the driver continues to drive erratically the light stays yellow. If it gets worse the light turns red. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s it. But like a lot of apparently simple ideas, there&#8217;s a lot more going on under the hood.GreenRoad was the brain-child of an Israeli entrepreneur who was run off the road one night by some wild kids. â\\x80\\x9cIf only their parents knew how they were drivingâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d he muttered to himself and the work on the company began. It morphed over the years from a consumer product to one aimed at commercial fleets. While the device is made up from mostly off-the-shelf products like a GPS chip, accelerometer, a CPU, mashed up with Google maps and a dashboard-like management portal, it took a good three years of hardcore R&amp;D to build.While you want the system to work well enough that aggressive driving tactics are caught, avoiding false positives are a must if drivers are to trust GreenRoad and accept its results. The algorithms can crunch more than 120 different driving maneuvers and the map on the dashboard helps provide context, both for the driver, and for a supervisor looking at the results later. For instance, a lot of harsh right turns could be the result of a hairpin turn in the road, not carelessness on the part of the driver.Thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a good deal of psychology worked into the device. Drivers donâ\\x80\\x99t want to feel spied on, so video and audio surveillance products havenâ\\x80\\x99t been popular. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also not a good idea to have something distracting, which is why early models that had icons to describe the offending aggressive move were nixed for the three simple lights. The dashboard, too, helps pull natural competitive levers by showing your performance, relative to your peers. And donâ\\x80\\x99t underestimate things as simple as starting each day with a green light: The key is holding drivers to a high enough standard, while letting them know they can succeed if they work at it and concentrate as well.GreenRoad has raised less than $40 million to date from Richard Bransonâ\\x80\\x99s Virgin Green Fund, Balderton Capital in London, Benchmark and DAG Ventures. On Monday the company will be announcing another $10 million from Generation Investment, a fund started by Al Gore and David Blood, a former CEO of Goldman Sachs asset management.Sound like a lot of money? Consider how much the company saves. Fuel savings just from driving less aggressively can save a company some $300 per vehicle per year, and when you factor in crash savings it&#8217;s more like $1000 to $4000 in savings per vehicle per year. That makes it a very easy ROI sale for a companyâ\\x80\\x99s CFO, environmental officer or safety officer.Now consider how much GreenRoad makes. It has 80 customers so far, and more than one of those customers have installed the technology in 20,000 of their cars. The three-year license goes for $1,000 per car, which the fuel savings alone cover. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right: Weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about $20 million contracts. And thereâ\\x80\\x99s more where that came from. GreenRoad Senior VP Eric Weiss says there are 80 million professionally driven cars in the US and the EU. That puts GreenRoad in the middle of a $80 billion market. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen many companies like these since the good old days of enterprise software.

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the past several years, there&#8217;s been no shortage of talk about alternative energy, and its potential to change the world. The problem is that most of it is just that â\\x80\\x94 talk. But tonight, a report that aired on 60 Minutes showed one alternative that is not only real, it&#8217;s already being tested by companies such as Google and eBay. You simply have to watch this.Bloom Energy are producing tiny fuel cell boxes they call &#8220;Bloom Boxes.&#8221; Two of these can apparently power a U.S. home (and only one for homes in countries that use less power). So how small are they? Look at the picture above, each device isn&#8217;t much bigger than a standard brick. Of course, they need to be surrounded by a larger unit that takes in an energy source (such as natural gas). But still, these units look to be about the size of a refrigerator and can easily fit outside of a home, providing it with clean, cheap energy.Currently, these boxes cost some $700,000-$800,000, but eventually, founder K.R. Sridhar envisions one in every home â\\x80\\x94 and he thinks he can get the cost below $3,000 for a unit to make that happen. And he&#8217;s talking a 5 to 10 year timeframe for this.Naturally, there are plenty who are skeptical of something like this ever working. There have been no shortage of fuel cell ideas over the years, but none get their own segment on 60 Minutes showing working units. And none get to highlight the fact that they&#8217;re already installed at companies like Google, eBay, FedEx and others. In fact, four of these Bloom Boxes have apparently been powering a Google datacenter for the past 18 months. eBay says their five boxes have saved them over $100,000 in electricity costs over the past nine months.Bloom Energy also has former Secretary of State Colin Powell on its board of directors, and he talked up the Bloom Boxes on 60 minutes tonight also. And the company has something in the neighborhood of $400 million in funding from the likes of Kleiner Perkins and others. Kleiner&#8217;s John Doerr is also featured heavily in the 60 Minutes segment, talking about why he thinks this company can change the world perhaps even in a more profound way that another company he backed, Google, has. Bloom Energy was Kleiner&#8217;s first green tech investment.Again, just watch the video and decide for yourself whether to be skeptical or amazed at this point. Right now, I&#8217;m definitely in the latter camp considering this thing is already being tested out. Apparently, Bloom Energy is due for a big formal public unveiling on Wednesday in San Jose (they have a countdown up on their site) â\\x80\\x94expect to hear a lot more then.CrunchBase Information',\n",

This will be their differentiating factor from Facebook, execs told employees at an all hands meeting last Thursday.The meeting was called in the wake of the firing of CEO Owen Van Natta and the related promotions of Mike Jones and Jason Hirschhorn to co-presidents. The meeting, which was held in the courtyard of MySpace&#8217;s Los Angeles headquarters to accomodate 600 or employees, was also broadcast to other offices around the world.The meeting began, say sources, with a discussion of the drama around the company over the last several weeks. Parent company News Corp&#8217;s Digital Chief Jon Miller apparently didn&#8217;t mince words, saying that Van Natta wasn&#8217;t moving fast enough and that there was too much conflict among the executive team. Hirschhorn also denied rumors that he ever considered leaving the company, which is contrary to the statements of about a dozen sources who&#8217;ve said the opposite to us.Miller also reiterated News Corp.&#8217;s commitment to MySpace and outlined how the co-president structure will work. &#8220;They get along really well,&#8221; he reportedly said. Hirschhorn handles product vision, Jones handles execution.More importantly, MySpace&#8217;s go forward vision was presented to employees, say our sources, and it was all about a single feature thrust that they&#8217;re calling &#8220;Discovery.&#8221; The idea is to hit users over the head with new stuff when they come to MySpace. New people they should be meeting. Movie trailers they should watch. Games they may want to play (perhaps against other MySpace users), music they should listen to, articles they should read. Etc. The activity stream that MySpace recently launched will be the backbone of Discovery, but other MySpace products will feed into this as well.If they get this right, the thinking goes, people will want to visit the site over and over again to see what new stuff they can do.This is effectively a recommendation engine around new content, says one source, but MySpace doesn&#8217;t want people calling it that. Still, the idea is that an algorithm (and advertisers) will determine what stuff you might like (or tolerate, in the case of ads) based on what other users are liking.The goal is to give users something to do on MySpace that&#8217;s somewhat different than Facebook. And get them to come back often.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'RightSide Capital Management is about to shatter the funding landscape. Led by David Lambert, Kevin Dick and John Lee, RightSide Capital believes that seed-stage capital needs a complete overhaul. RightSide will make 100-200 investments per year, and literally manufacture companies in a way that no firm has ever done. The fund, announced at TheFunded.com&#8217;s Future of Funding event last Thursday, will debut in the second half of 2010 and may give the angel funding market a much-deserved shakeup.Partner Kevin Dick went on stage during a panel on alternative funding methods and laid out what he believes to be the future of funding. Quantity, not quality, is king in the seed stage. Entrepreneurs looking for funding won&#8217;t have to go the traditional route of begging for a meeting and then having a second meeting and then waiting 3 months for traction until finally closing a deal. Instead, they will fill out an application &#8211; similar to applying to College &#8211; and receive a response in 2 weeks.Other aspects of the fund are equally revolutionary. The term sheets will be determined by a computer, and everyone will receive the same legal terms (the valuation and funding amount will vary based on the application). The fund will have a ranking method to rate applicants on a variety of categories such as experience/technical ability and systematically provide a pre-money valuation. They will also ask founders to put in their own money to ensure they have &#8220;skin in the game&#8221; and that they are invested in the future success of the company. The amount of money required will be determined based on financial documentation the founders are expected to provide.RightSide explicitly claims on their website that they do not care about $100M exits. They are fine with a large number of $10-50M exits. The irony pervaded the room when Mike Maples later gave a speech on investing only in Thunder Lizards at the same event. Mike Maples proclaimed that he only wants to do 10 investments a year, and often makes his decision on investing within the first 30 min of talking to an entrepreneur. RightSide seems to balk at that philosophy, and seems to believe that identifying Thunder Lizards requires more luck than skill. Their website proudly proclaims: &#8220;Suspicious of &#8216;Gut Feel&#8217;&#8221;.The RightSide model represents a stark contrast to the &#8220;traditional model&#8221; of raising early-stage capital. Entrepreneurs meet face-to-face with associates or partners of seed-stage funds. Seed fund managers are extremely elusive and often require multiple introductions to get a meeting. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to get this far, after a few meetings over the course of 2 weeks to 3 months (and sometimes longer), the fund gives you a term sheet.The term sheet is kind of a &#8220;promise&#8221; that the investors will fund your company, and provides you with details around pre-money valuation and funding amount. Then, the lawyers draft the legal documents required for closing a funding round, which can cost between $10-40K depending on the type of deal. Finally, if everything works out (and it can all fall apart at any stage in that process), the startup gets a check and they are officially part of the seed fund&#8217;s portfolio.RightSide believes this model is broken. First, they think that investors are generally unable to predict success of a company at the seed stage. As such, they are trying to systematize the funding process and minimize human bias. Second, Partner Kevin Dick argues that entrepreneurs shouldn&#8217;t have to pay thousands of dollars in legal and accounting fees. Instead, they are providing standard terms for all applicants, so the legal costs will be much less. Third, they are applying a &#8220;spray and pray&#8221; model of seed funding because they believe that they need to make a lot of investments to net a return. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re going to do 100-200 investments per year.If RightSide seems like an incubator on steroids, it isn&#8217;t. Unlike Paul Graham&#8217;s Y Combinator or Adeo Ressi&#8217;s Founder Institute, startups will have no set curriculum and may never meet each other in person. Kevin Dick says that they will set up educational sessions and events for portfolio companies, but will not be able to provide significant one-to-one mentoring for early-stage companies.Pre-money valuations will be set by a formula, which takes into account the background of the co-founders and the stage at which their idea is developed (i.e., idea on a napkin gets less points than a working prototype). During the panel at the Future of Funding event, Kevin said that this formula would probably have given Mark Zuckerberg a poor valuation, but at least he would&#8217;ve gotten funding. He notes that many seed investors passed on him, but RightSide would not have.The standard terms are yet to be finalized, but you can find a lot of the information on RightSide Capital&#8217;s website. Some tidbits have been provided: it will include preferred equity and not require the startup to give up a board seat.',\n",

But it&#8217;s less great when it comes after you&#8217;ve been caught. This is exactly the type of situation we wanted to avoid, and it&#8217;s the reason why we published the facts about the Daniel Brusilovsky situation as soon as we fully understood them. We didn&#8217;t publish the name of the writer because of his age until he admitted to the situation himself. And we didn&#8217;t publish the names of the companies involved because, frankly, they were the victims of the whole thing. But everything else was disclosed as soon as we were sure of the facts.A lot of people criticized us for &#8220;throwing Daniel under the bus&#8221; and for otherwise handling the situation poorly.  But anyone who runs a news organization knows that the truth tends to come out eventually. It&#8217;s best to just air everything out in the open right from the start.

If there was, we&#8217;d be the first to write about it.In this case InfoWorld may not have known what was happening until they read about it on a competing website. In fact, they probably would have terminated him as soon as they discovered what he was up to. But it&#8217;s not clear that they would have publicly acknowledged it afterwards.

       "  'comments_content': 'Venture Capitalist Mike Maples gave a talk last week at the Future Of Funding event in Silicon Valley put on by Adeo Ressi. The talk is highly entertaining and thought provoking.  He argues against the notion that startups that want to have a huge exit need to raise big money, noting that Microsoft raised just $1 million and eBay just $5 million, in venture capital.He says small startups can be hugely disruptive, and have proportionally huge exits. he calls these companies Thunder Lizards. He&#8217;s talking about Godzilla, which eats his competitors and disrupts like crazy. These are the market leaders, he says. Second place is boring.Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists tend to be wine sippers, he says, when beer slammers tend to be the big winners. He uses Chegg as an example, which grew to $50 million in revenue in just three years, but it took them two years to raise funding. The company, which rents textbooks to students, just didn&#8217;t make sense to most VCs.This is a perfect situation, he says, because there&#8217;s no real competition out there getting funded, either. He calls this being &#8220;non consensus right.&#8221; That&#8217;s the sweet spot. The key is to attack a huge potential market, with an emphasis on &#8220;potential.&#8221; You want to be right, and you want to be one of the only people to see it ahead of time.Great presentation.

       "  'comments_content': 'When I was at school, I almost never took sick days. This wasn&#8217;t because I enjoyed going to school &#8211; I really, really didn&#8217;t. Rather it was because I knew exactly what would happen if I dared to skip even a day of classes.A duck would somehow get into the school dining hall.Or an explosion would destroy the chemistry lab.Or two of my teachers would be caught having sex.Or someone would die.The specific incident isn&#8217;t important; the point is that I could guarantee that the one day I decided to skip school would be the day that something extraordinary would happen. Something that all of my friends would be talking about for the rest of the year while I was left to sit and sulk at having missed out.It&#8217;s a curse that has followed me through life: I could go to parties six days a week and you can be sure that the seventh is the one where the knife fight happens. The conference I skip is the only one where the wifi doesn&#8217;t suck ass. The episode of Quantum Leap I miss is the one where Sam Beckett briefly makes it back home.  And so apparently it is with my gig at TechCrunch.Regular readers may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t file a column last week. This was because for the past ten days or so I&#8217;ve been completely out of circulation: racing to finally submit the very, very delayed manuscript for my new book. I finally dragged myself over the finish line on Tuesday and since then I&#8217;ve basically been recovering: catching up on things like sleeping, eating and experiencing daylight. During that time I&#8217;ve barely glanced at the Internet &#8211; or at least not at any technology news. All hell could have broken loose in the past few days and I wouldn&#8217;t have had a clue.And so, of course, it did. Knowing that I was out of action for a few days, the tech world took the opportunity to go absolutely ape-shit mental.It&#8217;s as if every kooky, ridiculous or hilarious story &#8211; the stuff of which columnists&#8217; wet dreams are made &#8211; waited until I closed Techmeme for the last time ten days ago before it broke. The last piece of news I saw before I disconnected was the launch of Google Buzz. &#8220;Meh,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;if that the best this week has to offer, I can definitely take some time off.&#8221;I mean, at a push, I might have been able to churn out a column about how desperate Google&#8217;s new product launches have started to look. How they have started to look like an over-keen salesman at a Turkish Bazaar. &#8220;You don&#8217;t like Wave? Ok, ok, wait Sir, I have this.. you like Buzz? I do you good price.&#8221;But the precise moment I shut down my browser, the whole thing went to shit: it turned out that, unless you chose otherwise, Buzz would automatically display the names of the people you emailed most frequently.I mean &#8211; come on. This is Google &#8211; a company that sparked an international incident recently when it accused China of hacking its Gmail service to identify dissidents &#8211; and now it&#8217;s actively doing the spies&#8217; work for them? 1300 words would have flowed like water as I speculated whether Google is trying to prove to China that anything communism can do, capitalism can do better. You want to expose a few dissidents? Fuck that &#8211; we&#8217;ll expose all of them.And why stop there? You only wanted us to remove photos of tanks in Tienanmen Square from image search. Pah! We&#8217;re going to remove all pictures of tanks, and all squares. In fact we&#8217;re going to delete anything that&#8217;s even in the shape of a square. See you later, Spongebob! Take that, Commies!A few days later, Apple took up the &#8216;you have got to be kidding me&#8217; mantle by banning thousands of apps which contained even mild sexual content. Had I written a column about that, I&#8217;d probably have taken the controversial position that, actually, I agree with Apple: sexy apps should have been banned a long time ago. Not for their sexual content, you understand, but because they&#8217;re all really, really crappy.I mean, seriously, who would pay a dollar for a few photos of women in bikinis when you could just open Safari and have access to billions of photos of women without bikinis &#8211; for free! Hell, I could have fallen back on the old columnist&#8217;s standby of quoting Bill Hicks on how easily sex sells in America&#8230;&#8220;Will there be titties?&#8217;&#8216;Uhâ\\x80¦ sure?&#8217;BOOM! A check falls in my lap.&#8216;What are these titties gonna do?&#8217;&#8216;Uhâ\\x80¦ jiggle?&#8217;BOOM! Another check falls in my lap.&#8216;Jiggling titties! Who&#8217;d have thunk it! You&#8217;ve answered our prayers out here in Hollywoooood. We can&#8217;t write enough checks for you, boy!&#8217;But wait! It gets better. The story of Apple&#8217;s new found prudishness broke on the exact same day that we discovered that the Sex.com domain name was being auctioned off and that YouTube announced plans to livestream Tiger Woods&#8217; press conference in which he would promise never, ever to have sex with anyone ever again.Once again, the column writes itself: clearly we&#8217;re seeing the start of an online war against sex. In fact we&#8217;re seeing the dawn of Web 3.0: the Puritan Web. Say goodbye to sex.com and say hello to chasteglances.org. Forget Viagra spam and look forward to thousands of emails promising to help you &#8220;drive her wild with your extra-long&#8230; engagement.&#8221;I finally resurfaced late last night, fired up my laptop and started catching up with everything I&#8217;d missed. As I paged through all these stories &#8211; Google&#8217;s epic privacy failures, the war on sex &#8211; I cursed my bad luck. Any one of them would have made a great column &#8211; but all falling together? It was like Christmas.And yet of course, in my absence, my esteemed TC colleagues had jumped on them all &#8211; like Tiger Woods on a roomful of cocktail waitresses &#8211; leaving me with nothing fresh to add. I felt like an obituary writer who decided to go on vacation during that week in 1997 when Princess Diana and Mother Theresa both died.But then, just when I was about to give up, I noticed one last story. One that knocked all of the others into a cocked hat but that, as far as I could see, hadn&#8217;t been covered by anyone else on TechCrunch&#8230;On Friday, a school in Philadelphia admitted using webcams built into students&#8217; laptops to videotape and photograph them in their own bedrooms.I mean, just think about that for a moment: teachers using webcams to watch children in their bedrooms. Which bit of that story isn&#8217;t incredible? That they installed that software in the first place? That kids and parents weren&#8217;t told about it? That it was actually used? That the teacher then admitted to a student that it had been used? Or that even now the school is framing this as an unfortunate overstepping of an otherwise perfectly acceptable technological mark? Then there&#8217;s the fourth amendment angle, the scary paedophilia angle, the Big Brother angle&#8230;. I mean, even a arthritic monkey with half a typewriter could make a column out of that stuff.Unfortunately it was at this point &#8211; about five minutes ago &#8211; that I realised the time. I&#8217;ve spent so long catching up with everything I missed from the past week or so that six hours have passed.

       "  'comments_content': 'Women, Hispanics and blacks have always been underrepresented in the ranks of the Valleyâ\\x80\\x99s tech companies. Â\\xa0A new analysis by the Mercury News shows that from 2000 to 2008, the proportion of women tech workers in Silicon Valley dropped from 25.3% to 23.8%, and that the national numbers dropped from 30% to 27.4%. Â\\xa0In 2008, blacks and Hispanics constituted only 1.5% and 4.7% respectively of the Valleyâ\\x80\\x99s tech population â\\x80\\x94 well below national tech-population averages of 7.1% and 5.3%. It seems that the problem I highlighted in my last post on the dearth of tech women is actually getting worse, particularly in Silicon Valley. Â\\xa0And itâ\\x80\\x99s not just the women who are being left out, but also important minority groups.Is the Valley deliberately keeping these groups out? Â\\xa0I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. Â\\xa0Silicon Valley is, without doubt, a meritocracy. Â\\xa0In this land, only the fittest survive.Â\\xa0 That is exactly the way it should be. Â\\xa0For the Valleyâ\\x80\\x99s innovation system to achieve peak performance, new technologies need to constantly obsolete the old, and the worldâ\\x80\\x99s best techies need to keep making the Valleyâ\\x80\\x99s top guns compete for their jobs. Â\\xa0There is no room for government mandated affirmative action, and our tech companies shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have to apologize for hiring the people they need. Â\\xa0But at the same time, without realizing it, the Valley may be excluding a significant part of the American population that could be making it even more competitive.Â\\xa0 False stereotypes may be getting in the way of greater innovation and prosperity.Consider the data that I highlighted in my earlier post. Â\\xa0It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t always like this, but girls are now matching boys in mathematical achievement. Â\\xa0In the U.S., 140 women enroll in higher education for every 100 men. Â\\xa0Women earn more than 50% of all bachelorâ\\x80\\x99s and masterâ\\x80\\x99s degrees, and nearly 50% of all doctorates. Â\\xa0The companies they start are more capital-efficient, produce higher revenue, and have lower failure rates than those led by men. Â\\xa0Yet women are still a rare commodity in the ranks of tech CEOs and CTOs.How do we fix the â\\x80\\x9chidden biasesâ\\x80\\x9d and discrimination? Â\\xa0The experts Iâ\\x80\\x99ve spoken to have many great ideas. Â\\xa0They suggest we create role models, provide mentorship and financing, and teach entrepreneurship. Foundry groupâ\\x80\\x99s Brad Feld says that simple acts of encouragement from parents, teachers, and peers would make a big difference. Â\\xa0Cindy Padnos, of Illuminate Ventures suggested a solution that particularly resonated with me. Â\\xa0She says that women should follow the trail mapped by Indian entrepreneurs (no, not the American natives, but my kind: the immigrants).Thirty years ago, there were hardly any Silicon Valley firms with Indian-born founders. Â\\xa0UC-Berkeleyâ\\x80\\x99s AnnaLee Saxenian documented that 7% of tech companies started in 1980â\\x80\\x931998 had an Indian founder. Â\\xa0A survey conducted by my research team at Duke University found that this proportion had increased to 15.5% from 1995 to 2005. My team also determined that in this period, Indians started 6.7% of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s tech and engineering firms. Â\\xa0These are pretty astonishing numbers considering that according to the U.S. census, in 2000 less than 0.7% of the U.S. population and only 6% of the Silicon Valley high-tech workforce was born in India.I know from personal experience that Indian immigrants didnâ\\x80\\x99t have it easy. Â\\xa0They suffered from the same types of stereotypes as women, blacks, and Hispanics. Â\\xa0Despite having co-founded a software company that we took from startup to $120m in revenue; profitability; and IPO in a record five years, I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get Research Triangle Park (RTP) VCs to even return my phone calls when I was ready to start my second venture. Â\\xa0I later found out why: â\\x80\\x9cmy peopleâ\\x80\\x9d were great at mathematics and made great engineers, but didnâ\\x80\\x99t make great CEOs â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x9d didnâ\\x80\\x99t have the necessary management skills, didnâ\\x80\\x99t like diluting our equity ownership by raising venture capital, and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x9cfitâ\\x80\\x9d into the rough-and-tough American business-management culture. Â\\xa0Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what one RTP VC told me over lunch, to explain why his firm wasnâ\\x80\\x99t inviting me to pitch my business plan. Â\\xa0They were very busy and had to be selective in who they met.So how did â\\x80\\x9cmy peopleâ\\x80\\x9d rise above ignorance and bigotry? Â\\xa0When the first generation of Indians in Silicon Valley succeeded in shattering the glass ceiling, they decided to help others follow their path. Â\\xa0They realized that they had all surmounted the same obstacles.Â\\xa0 And they could reduce the barriers to entry for others behind them by sharing their experiences and opening some doors.In 1992, a number of highly successful Indian business executives formed a group called The Indus Entrepreneurs (which is now called TiE). Their mission was to give back to the community by fostering entrepreneurship. Â\\xa0They would hold monthly events, teach entrepreneurship, and provide mentoring and support. Â\\xa0And they would facilitate Indian-style matchmaking between entrepreneurs themselves and with investors and corporate partners. Â\\xa0They created two categories of members: a charter member, who took the role of guru, and a regular member, who would be a disciple.Â\\xa0 The Guru had to donate time and money (minimum $1500/year) and was not allowed to gain any personal financial benefit. Â\\xa0When disciples achieved success, they would be expected to pass it forward by becoming charter members and helping others behind them. (Note: TiE set a goal of helping all communities. Women are still underrepresented in its ranks, however).One of my current research projects is to document and quantify the accomplishments of TiE. But I already know the impact TiE has made. After my lunch with the RTP VC, I cold-called TiE co-founder, Kanwal Rekhi. He told me that my experience was no different from what he and others in Silicon Valley had endured.Â\\xa0 Rekhi advised me to look outside the region and to recruit a white male as president of my company. Â\\xa0TiE Charter Member Vinod Khosla advised me to contact VCs in Boston and gave me several introductions. After I followed Rehkiâ\\x80\\x99s and Khoslaâ\\x80\\x99s advice, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t take long for me to get a term sheet from Greylock Partners (of Boston).Â\\xa0 When the word of this got out, the RTP VCs came begging that I take their money. Â\\xa0(I didnâ\\x80\\x99t take their money and after I achieved success, I became founding President of TiE-Carolinas and would usually spend five to seven hours weekly â\\x80\\x94 even when I was really busy â\\x80\\x94 mentoring fledgling entrepreneurs.)Telle Whitney, President of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, says that TiE has done an amazing job and that its work is a great example of a mobilizing, formidable force in making change through networks. Â\\xa0But all networks are not created equal. Â\\xa0To achieve systemic change and have more women and minority-group members as entrepreneurs, we need to involve corporate leaders. Â\\xa0They need to personally be mentoring, proselytizing, and demonstrating by example a different model of investing in women and minority-group entrepreneurs. Â\\xa0There is nothing more powerful within an organization than having its own CTO talk about the importance of, for example, promoting women.I agree with Telle. Neither Rekhi nor Khosla knew me from Adam, but both readily gave me invaluable advice. Â\\xa0That is the type of mentoring that women, blacks and Hispanics need. In addition to establishing stronger networks for these groups, we need to have the CEOs and CTOs of all of our top companies volunteer their own time to help others follow in their footsteps. They need to do this because this is the best path to diversity and this diversity will enrich their organizations. And we need to have VCs mentor the women and minorities they typically ignore. They need to do this not only for social good, but also for their own survival._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Here are some links to women and minority networking groups which readers may find useful (If you know of others, please detail these in your comments).100 Black Men of Silicon ValleyAnita Borg Institute for Women and TechnologyAstiaForum for Women Entrepreneurs and ExecutivesNational Center for Women &amp; Information TechnologySilicon Valley Black ProfessionalsSilicon Valley Hispanic ProfessionalsSociety of Hispanic Professional EngineersSpringboard EnterprisesStartOutThe African NetworkTheÂ\\xa0 Next WomenWomen 2.0Young Women Social Entrepreneurs_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Editorâ\\x80\\x99s note: Guest writer Vivek Wadhwa is an entrepreneur turned academic.

And today brings another oddity.The AP is using their Twitter feed to tweet out their stories â\\x80\\x94 nothing new there, obviously â\\x80\\x94 but every single one of them links to the story on their Facebook Notes page. It&#8217;s not clear how long they&#8217;ve been doing this, but Search Engine Land&#8217;s Danny Sullivan noted the oddness of this, and how annoying it is, tonight. The AP obviously has a ton of media partners, and they could easily link to any of those, or even the story hosted on their ownÂ\\xa0site. But no, instead they&#8217;re copying all these stories to their Facebook page and linking there for no apparent reason.As Sullivan notes in a follow-up tweet, &#8220;i really miss when people had web sites they owned and pointed at. why lease your soul to facebook. or buzz. or whatever. master your domain.&#8221;What&#8217;s really odd about this is the AP&#8217;s recent scuffle with Google over the hosting of AP content. The two sides appeared to reach some sort of deal earlier this month (after months of threats and actual pulled content), but now the AP is just hosting all this content on Facebook for the hell of it?Sure, maybe they think that by hosting the content on Facebook, they&#8217;re being impartial with the tweets. But again, why not just use their own site?When I asked Sullivan to elaborate on this issue, he made a good point, &#8220;funny, they seem to get social (twitter &amp; facebook) more than basic SEO (the core of their issues with Google).&#8221; Oh the AP; the amusement never ends.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Over the last few days we&#8217;ve been tracking Apple&#8217;s recent decision to remove all sexual content from the App Store.  It&#8217;s an alarming move on Apple&#8217;s part, if only because it shows that the company is willing to throw developers (and their livelihoods) under the bus without any notice at all.  Now developers are left wondering: just what exactly is allowed on the App Store? As it turns out, the new policy may be even more restrictive than it first appeared.Earlier this week, when Apple notified developers that their applications were being removed, it said that it was removing applications with &#8220;overtly sexual content&#8221;.  That sounds like the ban only extends to apps that are little more than soft core porn.  But we&#8217;re hearing from multiple developers that it actually means anything that could be even the slightest bit titillating in any wayÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0including swimsuits and fitness outfits. In short, if your app has skin, it will probably be rejected.One developer, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to multiple App Store reviewers about the new policy.  He was told, &#8220;there will be no more applications that are for any purpose of excitement or titillation&#8221;.  He was told this included swimsuitsÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0both bikinis and one-piece suits.  Along with having dozens of his &#8220;sexy&#8221; apps removed, Apple also removed one that featured a popular fitness model in her workout clothes (the app was a marketing vehicle for the athlete&#8217;s line of protein powder).  When he asked if the ban would also affect apps like Sports Illustrated&#8217;s swimsuit application, the Apple employee wouldn&#8217;t give a clear answer, but it was implied that the SI app would probably be removed as well.Developer Jon Atherton, who is behind the popular application Wobble (which doesn&#8217;t actually include any sexual photos), also spoke to an Apple employee, and posted this list of rules to his blog based on what he learned:1. No images of women in bikinis (Ice skating tights are not OK either)2. No images of men in bikinis! (I didnâ\\x80\\x99t ask about Ice Skating tights for men)3. No skin (he seriously said this) (I asked if a Burqa was OK, and the Apple guy got angry)4. No silhouettes that indicate that Wobble can be used for wobbling boobs (yes â\\x80\\x93 I am serious, we have to remove the silhouette in this pic)5. No sexual connotations or innuendo: boobs, babes, booty, sex â\\x80\\x93 all banned6. Nothing that can be sexually arousing!! (I doubt many people could get aroused with the pic above but those puritanical guys at Apple must get off on pretty mundane things to find Wobble â\\x80\\x9covertly sexual!)7. No apps will be approved that in any way imply sexual content (not sure how Playboy is still in the store, but â\\x80¦)As far as we can tell, Apple hasn&#8217;t spelled out its new policies anywhere (our request for more details has gone unanswered). Â\\xa0Keep in mind that these rules may not be set in stone â\\x80\\x94 Apple is purposely vague about its policies, and they&#8217;re probably still changing.These moves are pretty ridiculous given the fact that the iPhone offers a full set of parental controls â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Apple should have just blocked the applications from view of anyone who wasn&#8217;t old enough to see them.  But the real issue with all this, as I outlined yesterday, is how callous Apple is being with regard to the well-being of iPhone developers.  It&#8217;s easy to paint anyone behind a &#8220;sexy&#8221; iPhone app as a scumbag, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of young men have iPhones, and they&#8217;re willing to pay a few dollars for sexy photos â\\x80\\x94 it&#8217;s business.  There are magazine empires that are built around this very principle.The developer who I spoke to says that he&#8217;s spent the last year regularly speaking to Apple representatives, attempting to tweak his &#8220;sexy&#8221; apps to accommodate Apple&#8217;s constantly evolving standards.  He was told things like (paraphrased) &#8220;a woman can be pictured in a bathing suit, but she can&#8217;t have her thumb on the suit&#8217;s strings&#8221; â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0because that would have been too sexually suggestive.  He&#8217;d make the modifications and resubmit, oftentimes only to have another photo get called out for an equally bizarre reason.  During these back-and-forths he was told that things would get better when the iPhone&#8217;s parental controls came out.  And that was true for a little while, until Apple changed its mind.After making around $30,000 last year from the App Store, he&#8217;s essentially lost his income. Â\\xa0And Wobble&#8217;s company, which was pulling in around $500 a day, is now making less than $10. Â\\xa0Apple gave these developers theÂ\\xa0green lightÂ\\xa0to build &#8220;sexy&#8221; apps, and now that they&#8217;ve built businesses around them, it&#8217;s tossing them aside without so much as an apology. Â\\xa0To Apple, they&#8217;re expendable.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In November of last year, Gowalla finally extended its reach beyond its iPhone app with a version of its app that worked on the mobile web for Android (and the iPhone&#8217;s Safari browser). It was a pretty good web app but had some limitations, which founder Josh Williams accepted because his team was at work on a native app for Android as well. That wait is over.While it&#8217;s not yet in the Android Market, Gowalla has released a very early beta version of the native Android app to its most dedicated users that patrol the company&#8217;s Get Satisfaction page. Williams posted about the new app a few days ago, and noted that &#8220;Technically, we are calling this beta release 0.1. We will release a more fully featured beta to the Marketplace before the end of the month.&#8221; Since it&#8217;s not in the Market yet, you can only get the app by visiting this static link â\\x80\\x94 or by using your Android camera to scan one of the bar codes you can find in that Get Satisfaction thread.Note: To install the app, you have to have your device set up for the installation of &#8220;non-Market applicationsâ\\x80\\x9d. This site runs through how to do that, but basically you go to Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Applications, then check the â\\x80\\x9cUnknown sourcesâ\\x80\\x9d checkbox.So how is the app compared to its iPhone brother? Well, surprisingly, in some ways I think it might already be better. While, as Williams, notes, it is currently missing the Trips feature, and it&#8217;s not doing any image caching, the 0.1 build of Gowalla for Android is slick and lightweight. As you&#8217;ll notice right away, the app has a distinctly different look because it has ditched the iPhone&#8217;s green hues for a cleaner, white look. I can&#8217;t tell you how many Gowalla users I&#8217;ve talked to that hate the green look of the iPhone app and would like a way to change it (I&#8217;m included in that list).More importantly, the Android version of Gowalla flips the features of the service so that your friend check-in stream is now the first tab. This makes the Android version more social right off the bat than the iPhone version, which buries that information in the last tab.Gowalla&#8217;s Android launch is timely as the SXSW conference is less than a month away. Last year, both Gowalla and rival Foursquare launched their iPhone apps at the conference, with Foursquare able to take an early lead over the past year. Foursquare now has apps for all the major mobile OSes except for Symbiam. Meanwhile, Gowalla is also close to launching a BlackBerry app. Game on.Check out some early screenshots below.

       "  'comments_content': 'While digging through the Chromium forums back in November looking for clues about the then-unreleased Chrome for Mac beta, we stumbled on an interesting bit of information: Google was moving away from supporting Gears going forward. While this move was obvious for some given Google&#8217;s heavy investment in HTML5, Google hadn&#8217;t talked much about what would happen to their plug-in that allowed for things such as offline access to Gmail. They&#8217;re talking now.In a post yesterday on the Gears API blog, Ian Fette from the Gears team comes right out and says it in his title: &#8220;Hello HTML5.&#8221; Fette notes that the reason there haven&#8217;t been many updates to Gears in the past several months is because the team has shifted its focus towards implementing the same features into Chrome through HTML5. So far, this includes Database API, workers, local storage, and web sockets. And soon, LocalServer API and Geolocation will be a part of Chrome as well, Fette notes. In essence, all of these features make Gears unnecessary â\\x80\\x94 well, at least in Chrome, which Google obviously wants you to use.Because of this shift of focus, Fette notes that support for Gears will be increasingly &#8220;constrained in scope.&#8221; What this means is that beginning immediately, they will no longer be supporting Gears on OS X Snow Leopard (and later). Meanwhile, Gears support in Firefox and Internet Explorer will continue in limited form for now. But both of those too will eventually be killed off. &#8220;We will not be investing resources in active development of new features,&#8221; Fette writes.Really, all Google is waiting for is an effective way to migrate Gears-enabled apps (and their users) over to HTML5. While there is currently no good way to do this, it seems as if Google just may wait for developers to drink the HTML5 kool-aid and then kill of Gears support entirely â\\x80\\x94 even if there are still some who are using it.I&#8217;m all for this. As I wrote back in December, I&#8217;m of the opinion that plug-ins are perhaps the biggest inhibitor of a unified web. That is, a web where everyone sees the same content the same way, no matter what browser or which OS they&#8217;re using. It doesn&#8217;t matter if those plug-ins are made by Google (Gears), Microsoft (Silverlight), Adobe (Flash), or anyone else.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'In August 2009, home haircutting system maker Flowbee filed suit against Google in federal district court in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company was the umpteenth to take the Mountain View company to court for selling sponsored search ads to competitors under its trademarked keyword, which it alleged &#8216;confused&#8217; customers.On the 18th of February 2010, Google filed its answer to the complaints and simultaneously moved to file a counterclaim against the haircutting system vendor (documents here).In the most recent filing for the case, Google denies most of the allegations Flowbee had brought forward, including that it has made any unlawful use of Flowbeeâ\\x80\\x99s alleged trademarks and similar marks. At the same time, the company admits that it allows third parties to bid on keywords that may trigger display of their advertisements as Sponsored Links.Google also filed a counterclaim against Flowbee for breach of contract. The search giant says that by filing the instant action in Texas, Flowbee breached the mandatory venue selection provision (federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California) of the AdWords contract it had entered with Google. The Mountain View company is seeking damages for the money and resources that were spent trying to transfer the action to the &#8216;proper&#8217; venue.And then there are a couple of nuggets in the whole thing that are quite amusing (if you&#8217;re anything like me, that is).For example: Flowbee in its suit filing documents attempts to define &#8220;The Internet and the World Wide Web&#8221; and mentions that people can visit Web pages using browser programs like Macintosh Safari or Microsoft Internet Explorer. In its answer, Google subtly points out that while it does not dispute the description of the Internet is essentially accurate, it denies knowledge of a â\\x80\\x9cMacintosh Safariâ\\x80\\x9d browser program (it&#8217;s simply called Safari).Also funny: Eric Goldman, Associate Professor of Law at Santa Clara University School of Law and well-known blogger, at the time Flowbee filed suit noted that a lot of the language in the documents was seemingly lifted from another lawsuit that was filed earlier by American Airlines against Yahoo and Google, covering similar grounds.But reading Google&#8217;s answer, I stumbled on the company name &#8216;Rosetta Stone&#8217; a number of times, and I wondered if Google&#8217;s attorneys had also copied most of the language from another suit and forgot to replace the company name Flowbee by Rosetta Stone here and there. Sure enough, the language education software maker sued Google a month before Flowbee did, equally claiming that the AdWords program infringes its trademark.And you thought sifting through court documents is always a boring way to spend a slow Saturday afternoon!CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Although Sweden-born streaming music startup Spotify has done well in Scandinavian countries it would appear to now have a local competitor in the shape of a new service launching in Norway. Tech companies Aspiro and Platekompaniet have teamed up with telco Telenor to launch a music streaming service for Norwegian users. That&#8217;s all fine and dandy. However, someone there needs to go to marketing 101 classes as the service is called WiMP. Yes, I can just imagine myself &#8220;WiMPing out&#8221; at my Oslo pad listening to music &#8230;Naming #fail aside, WiMP is launching with streaming deals with over 20 content providers for over 6.5 million songs, including the four major record companies and a number of smaller independent partners. These include Universal Music, Sony Music, EMI, Warner Music, Phonofile, Arts Pages, IODA, The Orchard, Beggars Group, Naxos, Vidzone and a few more.Just as with Spotify, you can search for and discover new music, create playlists, favourites, and recommendations. It&#8217;s in Norwegian, obviously.But aside form this being a vaguely interesting aside, it does rather pose a question for Spotify. If a local Scandinavian telco can come up with this, why can&#8217;t another telecoms provider? Afterall, they have the billing relationship. Yes, there have been plenty of similar services from ISPs, however Spotify may in fact simply be starting to get people used to the idea of streaming music, rather than the company that ultimately benefits, with other players coming up later with the actual services that take off. It can be tough out there on the bleeding edge.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Facebook has acquired its third company, Malaysian startup Octazen Solutions. Facebook says this is largely a talent acquisition, according to GigaOm. Octazen has a slightly different story on their home page, saying Facebook acquired &#8220;most of the company&#8217;s assets and to employ those assets in a different direction.&#8221;Either way, it&#8217;s leaving some people scratching their heads. Said one senior engineer at a competing company that we spoke to this evening, &#8220;Facebook just bought the web&#8217;s most talented and creative scrapers that have gotten around everyones rate limits and detection systems.&#8221; Said another person we spoke with this evening who is knowledgeable of Octazen&#8217;s product, &#8220;Facebook is so sanctimonious about protecting their own user data through Facebook Connect, but Octazen has been scraping user data for years off terms of service and then reselling it.&#8221; Both sources asked to remain anonymous.Facebook, for their part, have not yet responded to our request for comment.What exactly has Octazen been up to? The company is mostly about above-board contact importing from one service to another &#8211; signing in to Gmail from Facebook, for example, to import your contacts there and add them as Facebook friends. Much of this is done via OAuth and APIs, but Octazen is known to dive much deeper for data.One example &#8211; Octazen will sometimes collect and store user credentials directly, and sign into large social networks and other sites as if they were the user, say multiple sources. Then they&#8217;ll download the address book and social graph. A percentage of your friends on that service might be users of the service (now Facebook) paying Octazen, and you&#8217;ll be asked to friend them. But there&#8217;s a big question about what happens to the rest of the data as well, and if Octazen is storing a shadow social network in violation of terms of service to recommend user connections down the road.  And they may look deeper at data than they should &#8211; at email header information, for example, to get a better understanding of who you communicate with the most.But the most unnerving part of Octazen, say our sources, is the fact that they are very, very good at scraping data at scale without being detected. They may hit a service using lots of different IP addresses, for example, and remain undetected. Octazen could, they say, scrape very public sites like Twitter, where the social graph is on each profile, in a way that Twitter wouldn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s happening.In 2007, for example, People were buying and running Octazen scripts to scrape contacts in a very sketchy way: &#8220;So we use this toolkit from Octazen to scrape contact lists off of various sites.  Our ever eager users (ab)used this feature so much that hotmail blocked us.&#8221; The poster found a way to access Hotmail&#8217;s API instead of just scraping to get the data, and Octazen responded, saying &#8220;Very nice indeed&#8221;Our understanding is that Facebook already uses Octazen to mysteriously determine your long lost friends and suggest that you re-connect with them (leading to scores of emails into our inbox that Facebook is somehow reading emails or otherwise getting data they shouldn&#8217;t be).The big question is why Facebook would need to acquire a company located half way around the world if all they were doing is standard address book imports via OAuth and APIs, or proprietary but well documented protocols like Facebook uses. The implication is that these guys have serious expertise in data gathering at scale that may sometimes be in violation of the terms of service of the sites being harvested.This is obviously just one side of the possible story, albeit based on hard evidence of Octazen&#8217;s shady prior practices and via multiple sources. But until Facebook explains this acquisition in more detail, we don&#8217;t have much more to go on.Update: From Larry Yu at Facebook:As background, more than 30% of our users currently rely on an email provider other than Hotmail, Yahoo!, AOL or Gmail as their way of authenticating into Facebook, finding friends that are on the site and inviting new friends to join.  This percentage will only increase as we seek to grow around the world.  So we brought on the Octazen engineers because they are very good at building contact importers for these alternate services which comprise the &#8220;long tail.&#8221; This is important because a new user can then ramp up quickly since they can find and invite friends.  We intend to have them focus on building these &#8220;long-tail&#8221; importers and improve our existing solutions.It is not true that Octazen would collect and store user credentials directly to facilitate contact importing.  The majority of their clients installed the software on their own servers, so Octazen would not have access to any user data in those instances.There was an on-demand service where the contact importing process would run though Octazen&#8217;s machines.  But for this on-demand service, they only stored the username and a 1-way hash of the user password. This stored data can not be used to log in on behalf of the user.  It was only used for audit purposes so they could bill the clients based on successful imports and not attempts.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Normally, this wouldn&#8217;t be a huge deal since as they note, &#8220;Our shipping centers are continuing to send and receive DVDs , so your movies will be processed as usual.&#8221; But, increasingly, Netflix is becoming a streaming video service. And while that aspect is up and running on the third-party devices (such as the Xbox 360) that it works on, it&#8217;s obviously not working on the web. And given Netflix&#8217;s awesome customer service, I bet that means refunds are coming.As we noted back in August, Netflix sent a message to its subscribers (who were connecting through Xboxes) noting some brief downtime for their streaming service. Along with the message, they were offering a 2% credit to be applied to your next monthly payment if you were affected. You simply had to click on a link to claim the refund (and you could actually do it even if you weren&#8217;t affected, if you didn&#8217;t mind lying). A couple weeks ago, Netflix sent out the same notice following a similar downtime.It will be interesting to see what Netflix offers its customers for this downtime, which is obviously much more widespread. As they note on the site right now, &#8220;Our engineers are working hard to bring the site back up as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience and, again, we apologize for the inconvenience. If you need further assistance, please call us at 1-866-636-3079.&#8221;Despite my strong disagreement with their decision to agree to Warner&#8217;s 28-day window for renting new DVDs, Netflix remains a company that seems to handle customer service exceptionally well (unlike others).

In fact, there are so many that they&#8217;re all kind of blending together and I have no idea where to turn beyond the de-facto one Twitter uses, Bit.ly. But today, a new one has piqued my interest.ShadyURL (made by Wonder-Tonic) is awesome because well, it creates shady URLs. Rather than focusing on making a URL as tiny as possible to spread on a site like Twitter, ShadyURL takes a regular web address and converts it into something that looks as sinister as possible.For example, techcrunch.com becomes:http://5z8.info/dicksonparade_k5f1f_hackwebcamFacebook.com becomes:http://5z8.info/myspace-of-sex_n2&#215;0b_amazon.com-phishTwitter.com becomes:http://5z8.info/refugee-murder_c1e7m_serbian-bridesGoogle.com becomes:http://5z8.info/fake-gmail-login-page_g2i5t_yourdickAwesome stuff.One big fear about URL shorteners is that they obfuscate what may well be harmful websites. Some shorteners, like Bit.ly now check out the links and warn you if they point to a malicious site. ShadyURL doesn&#8217;t do that. Instead, it takes what may well be a perfectly normal website and wraps it in a URL that looks like it may point to some nefarious region of the web. You know, sex, murder, drugs, viruses.

       "  'comments_content': 'It&#8217;s no secret that we consider the PR industry, for the most part, the bane of our existence. They&#8217;re just under too much pressure to get results, and when we don&#8217;t do what they want (write about their clients), things turn ugly. And before things turn ugly, we get spammed. By phone, by Twitter, by Facebook, by email, by mail and by fedex. Some PR firms will lie, cheat, manipulate and then just smear your reputation to get what they want.Today something new happened though. It wasn&#8217;t a PR firm we went to battle with, it was a press release distributor &#8211; prMac. I know these guys well, because for the last year and a half they&#8217;ve sent me an average of 15 emails a day, sometimes far more. Each email contains a useless press release that someone paid them to spam out to the media. As far as I know, not one of these emails has ever turned into a story.Most PR emails come from a human, and it&#8217;s easy to just reply and tell them to stop if it becomes annoying. The more streamlined operations that spam stuff out at least give us an opt out to get off their dreaded mailing list. But not prMac &#8211; none of their emails have an opt out.Today was the day I decided to take a stand against the onslaught of prMac emails. Some small step in my hope to regain human dignity, I guess. Since there was no opt out, I simply sent out a Tweet, saying &#8220;prMac really needs to chill out on the unsolicited press spam, and give an unsubscribe link.&#8221; I followed up with a link to a single day&#8217;s emails from the company.If I were prMac, I would have seen this and either kept on spamming, or quietly taken techcrunch emails off their list. But that didn&#8217;t happen. Instead, they got angry. Really pissed off, actually.First came a comment to that image of the spam, saying &#8220;Claims it&#8217;s spam, but OPTED IN to the service. The reason for the duplicates is TechCrunch provided two email addresses.&#8221;Then a barrage of emails (sort of ironic). One said in part, and I&#8217;m not kidding, &#8220;prMac is an OPT IN service for the media.  We&#8217;re not spammers. We set up your account for you, only for your convenience and under your behalf&#8230;&#8221; Yep, they followed a statement that they are opt in only and that they aren&#8217;t spammers with an admission that they set up our account for us &#8220;only for your convenience&#8221; (and certainly not at our request).Unpleasant words were exchanged over the course of ten or so more emails. prMac forwarded an email from 2008 where they cajoled a CrunchBase staffer into giving up our emails to start the whole process.  I noted that I had no way of stopping the barrage, and kept pointing out that a simple opt out in each email would have been so&#8230;legal of them.But by far the most perfectly absurd comment came from prMac in one of their last emails, where they said to me &#8220;&#8230;you seriously need to take some diplomacy lessons my friend.  The smart ass remarks aren&#8217;t assuaging me one iota, and only making a situation worse than it didn&#8217;t even have to be.&#8221;Indeed. And since I want to become a better person, I&#8217;ve enrolled myself in a course on how to be diplomatic with spammers who don&#8217;t want to let go. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll handle the situation with more finesse next time.In the meantime, though, the whole PR profession really needs to get a grip. We aren&#8217;t here to do their bidding. We serve our readers. At least, the readers we like. And our community. If they want to be part of that community, they need to lose the sense of entitlement and chill out on the aggressive marketing a little bit. I would have been quite happy just venting on Twitter earlier today and eventually setting up an email filter to remove anything that came from them. But we&#8217;re only human. And this tirade of angry emails (just now yet another one from them popped into my inbox &#8211; &#8220;If your receiving distributions from us were such a problem, when didn&#8217;t you bring this up long before??  It&#8217;s not like we started doing this yesterday.&#8221;) was a little too aggressive and a little too much. So now I&#8217;ve vented more fully.',\n",

By November, the account had already landed creator Justin Halpern a TV deal. And today, it has now landed him William Shatner to star in it.The Hollywood Reporter is reporting that Shatner has agreed to star in the show as the father, and because of it, the show has been greenlit to shoot a pilot episode. It&#8217;s not yet clear when it will air, but when it does, it will be on CBS. The creators of Will &amp; Grace are executive producing the show for Warner Bros. TV alongside Halpern and Patrick Schumacker, both of whom wrote the script for the pilot. Both Halpern and Schumacker used to write for the TV and movie blog Screen Junkies.On Twitter, Shit My Dad Says continues to rise in popularity. By the time we wrote about it in August, the account already had over 100,000, but by November (the time of the TV deal), it was well past 700,000. Now, it has over 1.1 million followers and you can expect that to keep rising when the show airs.Of course, how well the show can translate a Twitter account remains to be seen. After all, it will be on network television which means no swearing â\\x80\\x94 a large part of what makes Shit My Dad Says tweets funny. In fact, of just the last 10 tweets the account has sent out, 8 of them would have to be altered to make it onto TV (7 feature &#8220;fuck&#8221; or &#8220;shit&#8221; and 1 features &#8220;dicks,&#8221; which CBS probably won&#8217;t like either).

       "  'comments_content': 'Last night, we reported on a new restriction that was being applied to Apple&#8217;s App Store: no more applications with &#8220;overtly sexual content&#8221;.  At this point, the exact nature of that ban is unclear.  But it&#8217;s a policy shift that may alarm many developers â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0even those whose applications have nothing to do with sexy content.First, a little background: we&#8217;ve seen numerous reports about  applications that have been pulled from the App Store for featuring sexual content, but there are still plenty of apps that have names like &#8220;Magic Boobs&#8221;.  I reached out to Apple PR to ask if they&#8217;d enacted a sweeping policy change that could affect many applications, or if they were only removing a handful of applications with especially explicit content.  This morning an Apple spokesperson sent back a response. It doesn&#8217;t have any answers:â\\x80\\x9cWhenever we receive customer complaints about objectionable content we review them. If we find apps that contain inappropriate material we remove them from the App Store and request the developer to make any necessary changes to their apps in order to be distributed by Apple.â\\x80\\x9dI&#8217;ve asked Apple to further clarify their stanceÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0does this only apply to applications that have received complaints?  Do they have any plans to specify what exactly makes an application too sexy for the App Store? Â\\xa0I&#8217;ll be surprised if they get much more specific.Now, it&#8217;s true that many of these &#8220;sexy&#8221; applications were little more than spam, featuring titillating titles, perhaps a handful of sexy photos, and little else. There were some applications that included more functionality, but it&#8217;s safe to say that the average quality of the applications on the App Store has almost certainly improved because of the new ban.  But it&#8217;s still a disturbing move on Apple&#8217;s part.Most worrying is that &#8220;sexy&#8221; applications were already blocked at one point until Apple specifically changed its policies to begin letting them in.  It was only a little over a year ago that the words &#8220;Boobs&#8221; and &#8220;Booty&#8221; in an application&#8217;s description weren&#8217;t allowed.  But Apple made the conscious decision to lift that ban. In effect, Apple sent a message to developers that on a platform where the rules are nebulous and anything innovative is risky, these applications were safe. Now it&#8217;s changing its mind.Since the App Store first launched in July 2008, Apple has gradually loosened restrictions on what kinds of applications it would approve. In December 2008, it started approving &#8220;humor&#8221; apps like iFart and Pull My Finger, as well as an NC-17 rating for adult applications.  And over the last year, it began allowing more and more sexy applications â\\x80\\x94 it even began offering parental controls with the iPhone 3.0 software update to help parents keep what their kids accessed in check.Now Apple is moving in the other direction, and it&#8217;s setting a scary precedent.  It&#8217;s showing that it&#8217;s comfortable throwing out applications that developers have spent their time and money building, without even bothering to give them advance notice. It&#8217;s one thing to have an application get denied when it&#8217;s first submittedÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it&#8217;s another thing entirely to have the rug pulled out from under you once your app has thousands of downloads and customers. Is Apple going to start blocking apps like Qik if it builds its own live streaming service?   Are iFart&#8217;s days numbered? Could Apple simply ban all NC-17 rated applications because too many parents complain?And then there&#8217;s an entirely different issue: censorship.  Apple is now one of the world&#8217;s largest gatekeepers to content, with a store that encompasses music, video, applications, and soon, books and magazines.  And it&#8217;s shown before that it&#8217;s a totally inconsistent hypocrite when it comes to which content it&#8217;s willing to sell.  Have exposed breasts in an R rated move? Sell it! Jiggling boobs in a silly iPhone application? Banned. Apple previously blocked an iPhone application that allowed users to access the Kama Sutra. What happens if it gets too many complaints about iTunes making it too easy to purchase books and magazines with sexual content?CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The past couple of days have seen some brouhaha over location privacy issues. Please Rob Me brought up the potentially troubling issue of tweeting out your location updates (and Foursquare responded). But actually, Google is doing something that&#8217;s perhaps even creepier.While their Google Location Alerts feature is not new (it started beta testing in November alongside location history), the amount it is being used seems to be increasing. And it&#8217;s freaking some users out. For example, we received two emails yesterday forwarded to us from users who have no idea why they were getting email notifications about friends&#8217; locations. And they have every right to be confused, because they didn&#8217;t sign up to get them.You see, Google sends you these alerts automatically if your Google Latitude contact opts in to them. Again, to be clear, you get these alerts if your contact opts in to them. As Google explains it on the site:Alerts are sent to both nearby friends if they are sharing their location with each other, even if only one of them has enabled alerts.Now, you may opt-out of these emails, but you have to visit the site to do that.So what do these emails look like? Like this:Subject: Location Alert: Peter XXXX was nearby! Google Location AlertPeter XXXXX (XXXXXX@gmail.com) was within 800 meters of you in San Francisco, CA at 7:15 PM. Check Google Latitude to see where Peter is now.While I&#8217;m a firm believer in the future of location, and believe that many of the privacy issues being raised now will eventually blow over as it becomes more commonplace, these alerts seem pretty creepy to even me. Especially because they are opt-out.And they&#8217;re actually a little weirder. As Google explains:You received this alert because you&#8217;ve shared your location with Peter using Google Latitude, and they have chosen to send Location Alerts when Latitude friends are nearby. Location Alerts are only sent when your friend is at an unusual place during a given time of the week based on their location history, filtering out routine locations such as a daily commute. Peter also received this alert.So you actually only get these alerts when your contact is in an &#8220;unusual place.&#8221; That makes some sense, since getting these alerts all the time would be beyond annoying. But obviously that &#8220;unusual place&#8221; may be a place Peter doesn&#8217;t want you being alerted about. Yes, he can opt-out of sharing that location, but the problem is that Latitude is always on, and most people forget (or simply don&#8217;t care) to turn it off.Google has caused quite a stir over the past couple of weeks by making many of the features of Buzz opt-out (even auto-friending, which they had to change). Obviously, opt-out helps drive usage, but it also annoys and creeps users out. And I can&#8217;t think of a better example then a user automatically getting an email with someone&#8217;s location that they didn&#8217;t ask for.[thanks greg]CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'A young man by the name of Dave Osborne built an interesting project called SWASAlert, a super-speedy weather severe alert service that supplies super fast weather alerts via Twitter and SMS. The easiest way to try it is to pop over here and select your city. You&#8217;ll then receive instant emergency weather updates straight into your TweetStream.Weather seems to be overlooked in the hyperlocal news world so projects like this, however oddly constructed, are an important addition to the mash-up ecosystem. Osborne recounted the genesis of his product thuswise:I had a friend in Minnesota complain to me about a year ago that the tornado warning got to him about the same time that the tornado did, and he asked why nobody had developed a faster system. We checked into it and the only valid claim we could verify was Superfeedr which was about 15 minutes for fetches. this was the primary impulse or inspiration to build our system.What we have here, then, is a good, old-fashioned mash-up. Osborne makes most of his money now from advertising and deals with about $1000 or so in costs to keep up the service and the timely feeds. This is obviously not for everyone &#8211; I suppose if you live in a high traffic tornado area, this would be great, but for the rest of us &#8220;34 degrees and it may snow later&#8221;  is enough of a weather report for the whole day. However, airplane pilots and the weather-obsessed may find SWASAlert quite useful.CrunchBase Information',\n",

In its promotion video, which I embedded below, Author Solutions says it has helped some 85,000 authors get their books published to date.Under terms of the agreement with Scribds, authors will receive 50 percent of the net sales of their titles through the startup&#8217;s social platform.

Kublax, a Seedcamp 2007 winner which launched in August 2008, was unable to secure funding in an arena that was chock full of competitors, including MoneyDashboard, and Lovemoney.com. But it looks like Kublax may have found a lifeline. In an email to the customers of its beta site, founders Sridhar Sethuraman and CEO Tom Symonds wrote that Kublax is in discussions with UK site Simply Finance to keep the personal finance sites alive. Here&#8217;s the text of the message:We are very happy to report that we are currently in advanced discussions with a UK based consumer finance website, Simply Finance, to find a way to keep the Kublax site up and running.As a result, our service will not shut down today as we had initially feared, and we will be working very closely with SimplyFinance to arrive at a long term solution which will allow us to keep the Kublax site and services available to you indefinitely.We will give you a further update on Monday. Simply Finance helps consumers to find the lowest rates available on mortgages, insurance, loans, debt solutions and a range of other financial products and services.

       "  'comments_content': 'Digital advertising infrastructure company the Rubicon Project today at the PaidContent 2010 conference has outlined its corporate strategy going forward. Essentially, the company is declaring that you&#8217;ll soon be able to stick a fork in the ad server, and to underline its vision it has published a fairly interesting manifesto on its website that&#8217;s well worth a read if you have a vested interest in the Internet advertising marketplace.The company also announced that it has tapped Allen &amp; Company as its financial advisor to support the companyâ\\x80\\x99s goals, which it says will include strategic acquisitions, platform expansion and other paths to accelerated international growth.The Rubicon Project, which launched in 2007, in its manifesto takes aim at players in the ad server technology market, saying that it is currently in a &#8216;dangerous&#8217; state of status quo. The company says it will fight to overcome the increasing price erosion that publishers have witnessed over the past few years because the balance in the marketplace has so far favored the demand-side of the equation. Frank Addante, CEO and Founder of the Rubicon Project, in a statement said: &#8220;Ad serving technologies currently available to publishers of high-quality digital content are outdated, making it extremely difficult to effectively manage todayâ\\x80\\x99s sales organizations. Working with companies whose real goal is to access more inventory on behalf of their own advertisers isnâ\\x80\\x99t in the best interest of, and may even be dangerous for, publishers. Revising that legacy technology, upgrading it, and tacking on bells and whistles isnâ\\x80\\x99t enough; publishers need technology designed specifically to meet their needs.â\\x80\\x9dAt the PaidContent conference in New York, the company has revealed plans to expand its platform in 2010 to offer additional ad serving, forecasting, and campaign management functionality across both premium guaranteed and non-guaranteed media sales, but also technology for automated demand access, self-service advertising sales, a centralized publisher data platform and self-service advertising sales, among other plans.The event is being streamed live as we speak.The Rubicon Project to date raised about $42 million in venture capital over numerous rounds from investors like Clearstone Venture Partners, Mayfield Fund, IDG Ventures and GE/NBC Universalâ\\x80\\x99s Peacock Equity Fund.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Pepperdine has a new study out that attempts to shed some light on the clubby, shadowy world of private finance. Researchers polled experts in lending, mezzanine capital, private equity, venture capital and private businesses themselves. Not a big shock, but things donâ\\x80\\x99t look pretty, especially in the venture capital world.A lot of the stats werenâ\\x80\\x99t surprising. According to VCs, thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a 65% decrease in up-rounds (where a company gets a bigger valuation) in the last six months and more than 60% of those polled expect a longer wait for an exit. Similarly, the bulk of the companies getting funding are still California-based.There does seem to be some shifts on where the money is going. After Northern California and Southern California the biggest area of investment geographically was in international companies. And investors said they intend to invest more in cleantech than software going forward. This is a big reversal, as software has long been the dominant category for venture deals, but itâ\\x80\\x99s unknown whether software has lost favor, or whether itâ\\x80\\x99s just become so pervasive that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really hold together as a category anymore.But itâ\\x80\\x99s when you look between the survey of VCs and the survey of private businesses that things start to get ugly. The businesses, it seems, vastly over-estimate their ability to raise funds. 41% of them feel that they qualify for venture capital funding. Meanwhile, the VCs surveyed indicated that their firms are only doing a few deals every six months and go through one hundred business plans to close one deal. Clearly, the rate of acceptance isnâ\\x80\\x99t anything like 41%, says researcher John K. Paglia, Pepperdiineâ\\x80\\x99s Denney Academic Chair and Associate Professor of Finance.A few more stats make that picture look worse. Researchers divided the portfolio companies into six stages and startups are still operating a loss in each of the first four. Those categories represent roughly 84% of all portfolio companies. That means the vast majority of privately held companies are still very dependent on venture money to stay in business. And investors arenâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily keen on their prospects. Respondents deemed between 12%-16% of companies generating revenues to be essentially â\\x80\\x9cworthlessâ\\x80\\x9d and deemed 20%-26% of their pre-revenue investments to be â\\x80\\x9cworthless.â\\x80\\x9d Ouch.Add to this that 72.7% of VCs said they had a decreased appetite for risk and that more than half of those polled expect their firms to do between zero and three deals in the next year and you start to get the feeling things are going to get a lot worse for private companies, in aggregate, before they get better.Of course life isnâ\\x80\\x99t that much better for the VCs: Sixty percent of them say their own prospects for raising new funds have declined over the last six months and 41% said they arenâ\\x80\\x99t planning on even attempting it in 2010.Long term, shake-outs are good for the industry, Paglia notes. Once valuations finish falling, worthless companies are closed or sold at a loss and venture firms that can&#8217;t raise another fund hang it up, venture capital will be a much healthier industry on the rise. The big question is just how long that reset takes.',\n",

Wobble, which lets you add &#8220;jiggle points&#8221; to any photo (use your imagination) hasn&#8217;t released a change in functionality for 6-8 months, and has been installed 970,000 times â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0none of these were flying under Apple&#8217;s radar.We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for more information.Update: Apple has given us this response. See this post for more.â\\x80\\x9cWhenever we receive customer complaints about objectionable content we review them. If we find apps that contain inappropriate material we remove them from the App Store and request the developer to make any necessary changes to their apps in order to be distributed by Apple.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Gossip mongers and sports fans alike are eagerly awaiting Tiger Woods&#8217; press conference tomorrow morning, when he&#8217;ll confront the public and apologize for his string of affairs that tarnished both his image as a role model and his endorsement earnings. And, according to one source, you&#8217;ll be able to live stream it from the world&#8217;s most popular video portal: YouTube.This is interesting for a few reasons.  First, it&#8217;s going to get a lot of traffic, as many people will be at work and won&#8217;t be able to watch the conference from their TV sets.  But it&#8217;s also another live video feed on YouTube, which historically has almost exclusively featured recorded content.  Over the last year or so, YouTube has been experimenting more often with live feeds, with broadcasts including YouTube Live, numerous political debates and events including President Obama&#8217;s record-breaking inauguration, and more recently, earnings webcasts.  But the Tiger Woods event, while certainly newsworthy, is a different beast.  It&#8217;s related more to gossip and sports than it is to our nation&#8217;s future or Google news.It could also be a sign of things to come. Â\\xa0YouTube doesn&#8217;t stream these events themselves (they&#8217;ve often relied on Akamai), but it&#8217;s apparent that they&#8217;re becoming more open to featuring live streams on the home page.  And even though YouTube&#8217;s roots may lie in user-submitted videos, it seems foolish to push users to other video sites whenever they want to see a major event live.The event starts at 8 AM PST. Other sites that will be streaming the event include Ustream and major news networks.Update: It&#8217;s official, YouTube just announced it here.',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'The team behind the hot location-based service Foursquare took the time tonight to write a rare longer post about location privacy. Their basic stance: we take privacy very seriously and understand it. Also, that service Please Rob Me should shut up.In fact, it seems the entire impetus behind Foursquare&#8217;s post was Please Rob Me, the mock service set up in an attempt to show the dangers of tweeting out Foursquare check-ins. We, along with several other sites, covered it yesterday. And while it&#8217;s hard to take that site itself seriously, it does raise some interesting points.Yes, as Foursquare notes and Mat Honan commented on GawkerÂ\\xa0yesterday, it&#8217;s just as likely that a burglar knows your home is going to be empty from 9 to 5 when you&#8217;re at work (provided you have a 9 to 5 job, of course). But people also aren&#8217;t routinely sending out their home address to thousands of strangers as they might be doing if they have Foursquare hooked up to Twitter. And when you add that on top of all of the other stuff that people send out on Twitter that perhaps they shouldn&#8217;t (when mixed with location information, etc), things get interesting.The point here is: does anyone really think Foursquare alone is going to lead to a rise in break-ins? No (I&#8217;m not saying that will never happen, but I don&#8217;t see it being an epidemic). The main point, as I saw it, is that tying a closed, symmetric network (Foursquare) to an open, asymmetric one (Twitter) is something that&#8217;s potentially troublesome for location-based services. But no one really seems to be talking about it.What I mean by that is that on Foursquare, just like Facebook, you have to explicitly allow someone to follow you (and you follow them back in return). On Twitter, anyone can follow you without your permission (assuming you have an unlocked account). When you tweet out your Foursquare check-ins (some people even do this automatically), it essentially makes Foursquare an asymmetric network. And believe it or not, some people are doing that without really thinking about it. Or they&#8217;re doing it because it&#8217;s easier to gain friends/followers on an asymmetric network.This is an issue that Facebook is undoubtedly thinking about right now as it considers how to enter the location playing field. As I said, right now, the network is largely symmetric, but recent changes are making it more asymmetric. And how they handle location information â\\x80\\x94 with their 400 million+ users is going to be very interesting. And potentially, actually scary.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'I feel like I should come to Flash&#8217;s defense, partially because I gave it one between the ribs last night, and partially because, in the words of Sherlock Holmes, &#8220;to see justice done is every man&#8217;s business.&#8221; Now here we have Steve Jobs saying in a WSJ interview that using Flash for video would reduce battery life from 10 hours to 1 hour, and suggests H.264 as an alternative. Let&#8217;s just take a moment to evaluate these plainly inflammatory statements.First, we may as well be clear about this part: Flash isn&#8217;t the best on OS X, and probably would end up occupying a good portion of the CPU, resulting in lower battery life. Whether it&#8217;d knock eight or nine hours off this theoretical ten-hour battery is, of course, the most tenuous of speculation.And why, we might reasonably ask, is Flash such a dog on OS X? Well, decoding 720p YouTube video can be either GPU-intensive or CPU-intensive. On Windows, Flash has tunnels to your video card to let its hugely parallel processors burst-decode a ton of information at a time. It can&#8217;t do that on OS X, from what I understand &mdash; mainly because Apple doesn&#8217;t want them to.(To put the above into context, 720p video files in MPlayerOSX take up a little more than 30% of my CPU.)Here&#8217;s the thing: Apple doesn&#8217;t like Flash. I don&#8217;t particularly care for it, but it&#8217;s one of the foundational technologies of the web and can&#8217;t be dismissed as trivially replaceable, as Jobs would have us believe. But Apple doesn&#8217;t like it. That&#8217;s the key. They&#8217;ve got a grudge against Flash and Adobe and they&#8217;re going to pursue that to the bitter end. They could call up Adobe and say &#8220;Hey guys, Flash is blowing it in our OS, why don&#8217;t we get a few guys together and work it out?&#8221; But they won&#8217;t. They&#8217;d rather they had an excuse for railing at it and excluding it from the table. Flash is getting punched in the breadbasket here for no reason other than that Apple doesn&#8217;t want to play nice.Jobs suggests H.264 as an alternative. Okay&#8230; H.264 is a video codec, not a wrapper like Adobe&#8217;s FLV. There are plenty of H.264 FLVs. If what he meant was we should have direct access (i.e. HTML5 or otherwise) to H.264 files on the web and elsewhere, then okay, that&#8217;s good, but it&#8217;s not really achievable right now since Flash is the acknowledged standard for web video. Every web video site uses it, though some are working on moving to HTML5. Maybe a few years down the line you could suggest replacing FLV with raw unwrapped files, but that time is not here yet.Lastly, while we&#8217;re on the topic, H.264 is just as closed, proprietary, and potentially inefficient as Flash. It&#8217;s owned, operated, and developed privately, but clearly Apple can only throw its weight behind one of them. It&#8217;s not good for users, but really, that&#8217;s not always Apple&#8217;s first priority.Update: Really, guys. The flamewar is getting a bit out of hand, isn&#8217;t it? This is all there is to it. It seems pretty clear that Apple could try harder to accommodate Flash, but they&#8217;re not going to, and yes, it&#8217;s a sound business decision. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that users aren&#8217;t going to lose out. And stop talking about the iPad as if it&#8217;s an iPhone. Different device, different form factor, completely different set of uses. Flash on iPhone is different from Flash on an iPad.I don&#8217;t want it on my phone because browsing the internet on a phone, even an iPhone, is still terrible. I would want it on an iPad because a huge selling point for the iPad is rich internet apps and media, many of which rely on Flash and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. You don&#8217;t have to be on one side or the other. It&#8217;d be nice to have Flash on the iPad, but Apple&#8217;s not going to give it to you, and I think that&#8217;s bad for end users. Okay, continue.',\n",

In here, you would find items from around the web that were gaining popularity fast. Of course, one person&#8217;s gem of popular content is another person&#8217;s crappy video. So today, Google has rolled out another update to Reader, to recommend items more personally tailored to you.The new &#8220;Recommended items&#8221; feed replaces the &#8220;Popular items&#8221; feed in the same Explore area. &#8220;With the latest round of improvements, weâ\\x80\\x99ve started inserting items selected just for you inside the Recommended items section,&#8221; Google writes.What&#8217;s not entirely clear from Google&#8217;s post is how they&#8217;re pulling together these recommendations for Reader users. I have to assume it&#8217;s the same way they&#8217;ve long recommended news feeds to you, which is by looking at your Reader Trends and web browsing history (if you have that turned on), and comparing it with other users.A quick scan of my own new Recommended items area shows results that are pretty hit-or-miss. But maybe that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a writer who has to scan hundreds of sites every day even if not all of them particularly interest me.There&#8217;s another small new feature in Reader today too: related feeds. If you trigger the drop down menu on a certain feed, and hover over &#8220;More like this,&#8221; you&#8217;ll see a list of feeds for what Reader considers to be similar sites. Subscribing to them is then just a button click away.Using Google Reader this past week has been interesting as Google Buzz has multiplied the number of users following the items I share several times over. This is of course because Buzz and Reader (and the other Google properties) share the same social graph now â\\x80\\x94 the same highly controversial social graph which saw you automatically friending certain people you contact on Gmail or over IM. In fact, Google had to stop doing that.I&#8217;m still not sure Reader, or Google as a whole, gets this whole social thing, but they&#8217;re certainly growing their graph quickly now.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Now those features are appearing on the StockTwits site itself, at beta.stocktwits.com. For now the company will run the old and new sites side by side and give users a period of time to get comfortable with the beta site. Co-founder Howard Lindzon suggests five things that new StockTwits users will want to do on the new site: watch the suggested user stream, peruse charts shared by other users, check out specific filtered ticker pages (example), watch the 24-hour StockTwits TV stream, or contribute your own content.Last month StockTwits acquired a financial news site and continues to bring in authoritative voices to share their trading strategies via blog posts and video.StockTwits is like cocaine for hard core traders, They started long ago with just a filtered stream of Twitter messages that touched on stocks. But they&#8217;ve continued to add resources that traders want and need to their product suite. I won&#8217;t be surprised if more than a few of the big financial guys make a run for them this year.

But at the same time, I don&#8217;t want the value of the card to go to waste. There have been a number of auction-like marketplaces, such as Plastic Jungle and Rackup, that have popped up to allow users can buy and sell their gift cards to each other in an eBay like interface (you can also do this eBay itself). Y Combinator startup CardPool is entering the space but with a slightly different twist to its model. Card Pool allows users to both buy and sell gift cards.CardPool buys people&#8217;s unwanted gift cards, and sells gift cards at large discounts.  Though the idea isn&#8217;t new, Card Pool has an attractive and fair pricing model. They judge the buyback and selling amount by how desirable the cards are. For example, you can sell a BestBuy&#8217;s gift card, which is highly desirable, to CardPool for 90 percent of its value. And on CardPool&#8217;s site, you can find a Best Buy gift card for 5 percent off its original value. On the other hand, 1-800-Flowers&#8217; gift cards, which are not as popular as Best Buy&#8217;s cards, are discounted by 30 percent on the site.I&#8217;m a fan of the site for a few reasons. The plus about CardPool is that it allows returns for cards for up to 100 days, and many of its competitors don;t have an expansive of a return period. Also, CardPool won&#8217;t sell gift cards that have expirations or fees. CardPool makes money off the spread between buying and selling cards. The startup is lean, with its two co-founders running the site, keeping overhead low. The company is also looking into forging partnerships with retailers like Barnes and Noble, Best Buy and others to sell their gift cards at discounted prices from CardPool. CardPool also has talent on its side. Co-founder Anson Tsai developed online music player Anywhere.com, which was acquired by Imeem in 2008.CrunchBase Information',\n",

It was sold to a company called ESCOM in 2006 for a reported $14 million.

Sex.com does not even appear in the first page of results on Google for the search term &#8220;sex&#8221;.   It&#8217;s sad really, like a scorned lover being put out on the curb.

Secondly, the point of the outreach was to showcase Aquafina&#8217;s new plastic bottles that apparently use much less plastic than the old ones. Of course, they sent God knows how many carbons into their air shipping us not one, but two crates of these things for no real reason. This year, the company has a better idea. Or rather, they think you do.Pepsi is calling for you to submit ideas to their Refresh Project before the SXSW conference taking place in Austin, TX next month. During the conference, people both there and across the web would then vote on their favorite ideas (through their site, Twitter, Facebook, etc). The winner, announced on the last day of SXSW&#8217;s interactive portion (March 16), would get a spot grant to make their idea a reality. The Refresh Project for this month is currently giving away $1.3 million in funding, for example.The Refresh Project traditionally breaks up ideas into the following categories: Health, Arts &amp; Culture, Food &amp; Shelter, The Planet, Neighborhoods, and Education. But for this SXSW event, Pepsi is looking for &#8220;digital pro-social&#8221; ideas.

       "  'comments_content': 'Last September, while the Apple/Google Voice fiasco was still in full swing, an interesting application called Line2 was allowed into the App Store.  The application acts as a mix between Google Voice and Skype, allowing small businesses to add a separate, dedicated business line to their iPhones in addition to the phone&#8217;s &#8220;regular&#8221; number.  The service also includes features like conference calling, auto-attendant, advanced call management, and more. And today, Line2 is getting an update that makes the app &#8220;dual mode&#8221;, allowing it to handle both inbound and outbound calls over cellular voice networks, 3G data or WiFi (mostly) seamlessly.  You can download the application here.CEO Peter Sisson says that this is the first iPhone application that lets you use one phone number for both inbound and outbound calls over both WiFi and cellular networks on AT&amp;T.  So what does that mean?  If you&#8217;re one of the millions of iPhone users who has to deal with AT&amp;T&#8217;s shoddy network, Line2 can now intelligently receive a call over WiFi when it&#8217;s available (you don&#8217;t have to manually instruct the app to use WiFiÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0it will do it automatically). And if you leave your WFi network during the call, the phone can automatically switch to 3G.Unfortunately, the new feature comes with a caveat: in order to receive an inbound call over WiFi, you&#8217;ll have to have the Line2 application open at the time the call comes in.  Sisson says that the company is developing a workaround that uses push notifications (you&#8217;ll get an alert when someone tries calling you, hit OK, and the app will launch and receive the call over WiFi) but for now I suspect most people will still be getting inbound calls over the cellular network. Still, if you&#8217;re using your iPhone for business calls and are sick of dealing with dropped calls, this seems like a great solution.Line2 offers a 30 day free trial, and costs $15 a month after that.First Dual Mode WiFi VOiP Cell Phone App &#8211; Line2 from Toren Ajk on Vimeo.CrunchBase Information',\n",

       "  'comments_content': 'Last December, mobile data swapping startup Bump opened up its iPhone API in a small, private beta.  Today, they&#8217;re opening the floodgates to everyone.  Developers who implement Bump&#8217;s API can use it to transfer data between two nearby phones simply by asking users to tap their devices together â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0a feat that&#8217;s still remarkably difficult on most smart phones.To kickstart its API launch, Bump held a contest that invited developers to work the API into their iPhone applications.  You can see a gallery of the winners here.  The winning apps include CheckOut, which lets you share gift cards with friends by tapping your phones together; CloudNote, which lets you swap digital Post-It notes; and SocialFuse, which allows you to connect on Twitter and LinkedIn with someone (again, by tapping your phones together).  Be sure to check out the gallery page for a half dozen runners-up to get more ideas of what the API can do.For many startups, an API is a nice way to build a community but isn&#8217;t necessarily a key to success.  I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case for Bump â\\x80\\x94 its API will likely prove very important.  Bump wants to become the way people are swapping their contact information, data, and even money when they&#8217;re standing next to each other.  Bump can integrate that functionality into their own app, but the barrier to using the service would be much lower if it was built-in to a variety of other popular applications.CEO David Lieb says that Bump issued 300 developer keys so far.  And while the current API is iPhone only, an Android version is in the works â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0and it&#8217;s getting &#8220;an increasing number of requests&#8221;.  Bump&#8217;s official mobile application, which is available on both iPhone and Android, is now closing in on 10 million downloads.CrunchBase Information',\n",

Or more specifically, what it&#8217;s purpose is. And in fact, there&#8217;s even still some confusion amongst heavy web users about whether Voice is VoIP, for example (it&#8217;s not â\\x80\\x94 yet). So Google has today launched a series of videos to explain the service.The first (embedded below) is a simple overview, &#8220;What is Google Voice.&#8221; The 11 others go into more detail about actual features such as the mobile app (as in, the one that actually works on the iPhone), how to block callers, sharing voicemails, personalized greetings, and connecting all your numbers to your one Google Voice numbers, among other things. You can find them all on this new YouTube page that Google has created (just in case you thought Microsoft were the only ones using YouTube for product promotion).There is also a video describing voicemail transcription. My favorite part of this video is how Google skirts around how the vast majority of the voice transcriptions are in absolute gibberish. &#8220;Transcriptions aren&#8217;t perfect, but we hope they&#8217;re good enough to save you from listening to the message.&#8221; I have yet to experience that.

Today comes news that will make it even easier to buy Facebook Credits: you&#8217;ll be able to buy them with PayPal.The new partnership actually encompasses a few areas of Facebook&#8217;s payments.  Along with Facebook Credits, you&#8217;ll be able to use PayPal to purchase Facebook Ads.This is big news for both companies.  PayPal has been trying to establish a greater presence in micropayments and on Facebook itself.  And Facebook will now make it easier for PayPal&#8217;s 81 million users to quickly stock up on ads and buy its credits, which are only going to become more important on the site going forward.  Other payment options for Facebook include standard credit cards and mobile phones (using Zong).One other reason why this is interesting: given Facebook&#8217;s interest in extending itself beyond Facebook.com through services like Facebook Connect, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if it started prompting people to start &#8220;Paying With Facebook&#8221; on external sites, which would make it competitive with PayPal.

Triggit is part of a new movement in advertising  that holds real-time auctions for individual ad impressions, which allows advertisers to better target which sites their ads appear on and who sees them.  And today, Triggit has launched  a new self-serve platform that it hopes will make running display advertising as easy as it is to run the text-based search ads that made Google a money-making machine.Triggit launched this demand-side platform in October, but up until now it has been a &#8216;full service&#8217; solution â\\x80\\x94 in other words, you&#8217;d have to work directly with the company in order to manage your advertising campaigns through their system.  Now anyone can sign up.For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with these real time ad auctions, Triggit sits on top of a half dozen real time ad exchanges, which are offered by Google, Yahoo, and others.  When these ad exchanges have an available impression they offer it, in real-time, to services like Triggit to see how much their clients are willing to bid for the ad impression.  Triggit&#8217;s system automates this for their customers, allowing them to set rules around how much they&#8217;re willing to spend and where their ads should be shown.The new self-serve signup form should be straightforward to anyone who has run an ad campaign before.  You enter the maximum CPM you&#8217;re willing to spend on your ads, upload your creative, and if there&#8217;s a maximum number of times you&#8217;d like the ad to be shown to a given user, you can set a frequency cap.There are also some advanced options for tracking ad conversions and retargeting.  And Triggit&#8217;s tracking pixel can dynamically adjust an advertising campaign automatically â\\x80\\x94 if the system detects that a certain site is performing better than others, it can start sending more impressions to that site.  Other options include geotargeting, and the ability to whitelist or blacklist specific sites.CrunchBase Information',\n",

The investment was led led by SK Telecom Americas, a subsidiary of the Korean telecom giant, which will help EveryScape expand into Asia.  Existing investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Dace Ventures also participated.  EveryScape&#8217;s previously raised a $7 million Series B in March, 2008 and a $4.5 million Series A in 2005.Up until now, EveryScape has been stitching together navigable street photos into 3D environments paired with Google Maps.  Of course, Google Maps does much the same thing with its Street View feature.  EveryScape, however, can take the viewer inside buildings.  Businesses can pay to be listed and called out in the street view mode, and even pay for EveryScape to create those indoor 3D tours.This sort of experience becomes much more useful on a mobile phone when you are trying to find a business or some other point of interest when you are standing on the street nearby.  Still, it&#8217;s tough to compete against Street View on Google Maps, not to mention similar efforts on Bing.  That is why EveryScape is taking partner-driven strategy,&#8221; says CEO jim Schoonmaker.  He confirms that EveryScape&#8217;s relationship with SK will go beyond the investment, but can&#8217;t share any details beyond that.  He also says more partnerships are on the way, and claims to have a cost advantage over Google and Microsoft in creating these immersive photo-based virtual environments because as a startup EveryScape has been forced to use off-the-shelf equipment.

       "  'comments_content': 'Last summer, realtime search engine OneRiot was one of the first engines to debut an API to allow developers to integrated OneRiot&#8217;s search results into their applications. Less than a year later, OneRiot is seeing 97 percent of its total searches coming through its API. Today, OneRiot is rolling out a new version of its search API, which includes support for for RiotWise, OneRiotâ\\x80\\x99s ad network, enabling developers to make money off of search results. Additional new features include the ability  to deliver vertical and domain-specific search experiences for their users.OneRiot originally opened its free search API to web developers in June 2009. The startup says the  API is now powering hundreds of millions of searches for a growing number of partners. Partners include social messaging apps (e.g. Digsby), browsers (e.g. IE8), mobile apps (e.g. Ã\\x9cberTwitter), large consumer websites (e.g. Guardian.co.uk) and, other search engines (Yahoo and Microsoft). Currently OneRiot has 105 API partners in total.The first major part of the new API is the integration of a href=&#8221;http://www.crunchbase.com/product/riotwise&#8221;&gt;RiotWise. Last year, OneRiot ventured into the advertising world with RiotWise, an ad format which places content in an emphasized position in their realtime feed. The search engine also launched a pilot program of RiotWise Trending Ads, a stream of ads that correspond to trending topics as they emerge across the social web. Now any developer using the OneRiot search API will now also receive RiotWise ads for the realtime web. Developers can choose to display them (and get paid) or not. RiotWiseâ\\x80\\x99s ads are comprised of content that similar to within Google, are served up via keywords being searched for. But unlike Google, advertisers arenâ\\x80\\x99t bidding on keywords. Instead, content producers strike a deal with OneRiot to place their content in an emphasized (but clearly labeled) place in their realtime feed within the search engine. OneRiot claims that RiotWise ads have been performing at 3 to 4 times the average industry standard click through rates (CTR) for ads in realtime web apps. Developers who tap into the new API will share revenue with OneRiot but it&#8217;s unclear what the rev share will be. The new API has also been tweaked to allows for specific searches. Developers can enable domain-based search, which allows for realtime search across a specific website or network. For example, the Guardian is the first partner to use this feature of the new API in its â\\x80\\x9cZeitgeistâ\\x80\\x9d tool that features realtime news content from the site.OpenRiot&#8217;s API will include the ability to integrate vertical realtime search so developers can choose to receive realtime results for specific verticals such as news, videos and images. The same filter can be places for searches across niche verticals, including realtime search results for gadgets, politics, and music. Lastly, OneRiot has rolled out a new &#8220;Tweet&#8221; format to search results allowing developers to receive search results and ads formatted like a Tweet, with only 140 characters, including a bit.ly shortened URL. This format is ideal for third-party Twitter applications working with limited real estate. As we&#8217;ve written in the past, OneRiot runs the risk of surfacing irrelevant or spammy content with realtime ads. But as a realtime search engine, OneRiot has invested heavily in spam prevention and is constantly sorting through millions of pieces of content to determine what is relevant and what isnâ\\x80\\x99t. Regardless, it seems like a viable monetization tool for developers. The startup, which just raised $7 million in funding, has been steadily innovating its product and is gathering up partners quickly. The realtime stream ramped up this year with all the big players adding functionality to their search offerings and OneRiot was smart to get in the game early. As we&#8217;ve seen with the various partner deals struck with both tech giants and startups, OneRiot&#8217;s search results and API are in demand. And the improvement to its API to be able to refine results and possibly make money will only make its offering more appealing in the future. \\tCrunchBase Information',\n",

However, Songkick has been around since 2007 and is clearly building traction.Songkick is also making hay with it&#8217;s API strategy, releasing data on the 1.4 million past concerts and complete tour histories of thousands of artists going back 50 years for third party developers. As a result, the Hype Machine has now launched listings via the Singkick API.Songkick&#8217;s business model is based around offering affiliates a revenue split on ticket sales.Songkick was founded in October 2007 by Ian Hogarth, Michelle You andPete Smith. The company has funding from Index Ventures, and a group of angels including Saul Klein, (The Accelerator Group), Alex Zubillaga (former EVP of Digital Strategy and Business Development at Warner Music Group), Jeff Clavier (Softech VC), Dan Porter (co-founder of Ticketweb), Peter Read (Music Nation), Andrew Weissman and John Borthwick (Betaworks), Stefan Glaenzer (ex-Chairman Last.fm), Daniel Miller (founder of Mute Records), Mike Heneghan (former MD Mute Records), and Y Combinator.CrunchBase Information',\n",

I could definitely imagine using this in a car or on a high-wire strung between two buildings over Cincinnati.You can download it here or take a picture of the QR code above. It seems to be offloading the voice recognition, which is pretty cool, and at the low, low price of free$2.99 (sorry), it&#8217;s worth a second look.Product Page',\n",
