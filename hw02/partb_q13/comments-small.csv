"7","1","So basically @anywhere is just an Oauth login system, just like my facebook-connect or Google Friends Connect? What&#8217;s the added value?First with OpenID and Oauth people are told they only need 1 login to get everywhere. Now it seems I have to decide wheter to use my google, twitter or facebook account to do this&#8230;. I still miss something","Erik","2010-04-01","1"
"8","1","second, this looks exactly like facebook connect, the only cool thing is the rollover, but even that isn&#8217;t that cool.","Andrew Furman","2010-04-02","1"
"9","1","Both brings login with their credentials, and post back to the mothership (Facebook or Twitter). Anything else though, because it sounds more phenomenal than that when announced.","Seika","2010-04-02","1"

"13","1","This doesn&#8217;t appear to have any functionality beyond what&#8217;s available currently through twitter&#8217;s oauth API. The exception is the hover card, although this could certainly be built with the current API and a little javascript.While this is certainly to do with @anywhere it makes me wonder how twitter will handle third party competition with this service &#8211; will they add terms to the API to stop people competing, or will they remove or limit certain methods. Either way, it&#8217;s a worry.","James","2010-04-02","1"
