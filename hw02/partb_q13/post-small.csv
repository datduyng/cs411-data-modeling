"1","We Just Tested Twitter&#8217;s @anywhere Platform (Screenshots)","Jason Kincaid","1","14","During his keynote at SXSW last month, Twitter CEO Evan Wiliams announced an upcoming new platform called @anywhere, which would allow third party sites to integrate Twitter features (he also showed off some of the partners who would be featuring the platform, which you can see in the image at right).  Twitter didn&#8217;t give a launch date for when sites would start integrating the new platform, but it looks like we&#8217;ve just come across the first site to feature @anywhere.  Meet Eggboiling.com.The site, which will almost certainly be pulled down soon after this post is published, is clearly a testing environment for @anywhere, but it&#8217;s currently open to the public.  Update: Twitter has taken the site down. It features the following (all shown in the screenshots below): various variable states; a button to &#8216;Connect With Twitter&#8217;; buttons to follow twitter users @jack, @biz, and @ev; a test hovercard that allows me to see @wendyverse&#8217;s latest tweets and follow counts at a glance, and a test box that lets me tweet.  It isn&#8217;t particularly easy on the eyes, but it works well enough.Hitting &#8220;Connect to Twitter&#8221; pulled in my Twitter profile photo and gave me the option to log out.  Clicking on each of the &#8216;follow&#8217; buttons appropriately changed the status from &#8220;Follow @jack&#8221; to &#8220;Following @jack&#8221; the next time I refreshed the page. (it just showed &#8216;pending&#8217; until I refreshed). And sending a tweet from the tweet box worked properly (it says that my tweet was sent via Egg Boiling).If you&#8217;re fast, you may be able to try it out for yourself.Before logging inOAuth to loginConnected to Twitter (but before image/logout link have loaded)Image/logout link appear after refreshing the pageTesting the hovercardAfter clicking the &#8216;more&#8217; button on the hovercardThanks to Spencer Transier for the tip!CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/we-just-tested-twitters-anywhere-platform-screenshots/","2010-04-01","0","14","314","223","4.130293","5.686099","0.00000","0.00000"
"2","Facebook To Launch &#8216;Relationships&#8217; At f8, Teams With Zynga To Spur Romance Through Gaming","Jason Kincaid","1","30","Later this month Facebook is holding its f8 conference, where it will be launching a slew of new features (we&#8217;ve already broken the news on quite a few of them).  Tonight, the company has written  a blog post announcing what is perhaps the most ambitious and creepy of them all: Facebook is looking to get into the dating game, and it&#8217;s turning to Zynga for help.The gist of the new product?  Dubbed &#8216;Relationships&#8217;, Facebook is going to soon offer a section of the site dedicated to helping users meet potential romantic partners.  To do that, the company has been working with Zynga over the last four months to develop games that &#8220;synthesize romance and foster relationships through social gaming mechanics&#8221;, helping users flirt and get to know each other using Farmville-like games to help break the ice.In the post, Facebook says that it will look at the profiles of your previous boyfriends/girlfriends to determine the personality traits you&#8217;re attracted to most, and that it will also use advanced photographic analysis to figure out your preferred facial structure and body type. In an attempt to quell privacy concerns before they begin, Facebook notes that all of this is done automatically, and that at no point are employees allowed to view these reports on your innermost psyche. How reassuring.The site appears to be broken up into three sections: at the top is a section for &#8216;Flirts&#8217;, which displays the Facebook friends you&#8217;ve been interacting with most.  In a move certain to cause riots, Facebook is now allowing users to keep tabs on how many times each of their friends has visited their profile. Facebook claims that this will make it easier to figure out who is lusting after you, and that &#8220;shadier&#8221; visitors will simply learn not to be so creepy. Below this is a section for games and lessons.  These appear to be the Zynga-designed apps, which cover everything from flirting to lessons on hygiene.Finally, there&#8217;s a &#8216;Recent Dates&#8217; section.  It&#8217;s unclear exactly what this is for, but there&#8217;s a Facebook-branded baseball diamond that apparently prompts users to share &#8220;how far&#8221; they got on their recent dates to their friends&#8217; News Feeds.  Given how much these definitions have shifted over the years, this could get messy.The 6.8 ProjectPerhaps most interesting is the fact that the new Relationships feature belongs to a new (and somewhat sinister sounding) ongoing initiative that Facebook is internally calling The 6.8 Project. The name, which is an allusion to Earth&#8217;s total population of 6.8 billion people, is meant to symbolize Facebook&#8217;s goal of connecting everyone on the planet.  The concern is that that may not be enough.Facebook has grown so quickly over the last few years that the company is worried that its long-term expansion potential over the next decade is limited. At its current growth rate, Facebook will have saturated the market of Internet-using humans in seven years. So — to put things bluntly — they&#8217;re looking to encourage current users to procreate, though they&#8217;ve only said as much with cutesy euphemisms.Facebook wouldn&#8217;t comment on its future plans for the 6.8 Project, but we hear that the company intends to launch a &#8216;Babybook&#8217; directory for children up for adoption, and there are also discussions about lowering Facebook&#8217;s minimum age to five years old.Excerpt from Facebook&#8217;s Blog:&#8220;Over the last six years, Facebook has been embraced by over 400 million people around the world — and we&#8217;re still growing. During that time, our engineers have managed to overcome some truly monumental hurdles, empowering friends and families to share their photos, videos, and thoughts with the people they care about.But there&#8217;s still one fundamental human need that we haven&#8217;t yet been able to take care of, and ironically enough it&#8217;s the primary reason people log on to Facebook every day. It goes by many names: Love. Romance. Great White Buffalo.  Call it what you will, it&#8217;s something that all of us are looking for. We hope to help you find it with Facebook Relationships.We look forward to sharing more details about the new feature at this month&#8217;s f8 conference.  With Relationships, we&#8217;re going to take your friendships to the next level.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/facebook-to-launch-relationships-at-f8-teams-with-zynga-to-spur-romance-through-gaming/","2010-04-01","0","30","717","488","4.138177","5.952869","0.00000","0.00000"
"3","NYTimes Request Correction/Removal Of Our Post. We Decline.","Michael Arrington","2","38","A NYTimes communications person emailed to ask us to correct or take down our post earlier today about the debut of their new iPad application,  which they&#8217;re calling &#8220;The New York Times on the iPad.&#8221; The post, they say, contains &#8220;extremely old information that is inaccurate&#8221; and requests that we correct or take down the post.The post, of course, is a fake. It&#8217;s the third of our April Fools jokes and while we knew it would be the most subtle, we didn&#8217;t realize that pretty much no one at all would get the message. So I&#8217;ll explain, but just a little. If you compare the post to the article linked from the post (there&#8217;s just one link in the whole post), you&#8217;ll notice that it is identical to the 1996 NYTimes article announcing their website. The only changes we made were to replace &#8220;Web Site&#8221; with &#8220;iPad App&#8221; and &#8220;Word Wide Web&#8221; with &#8220;iPad.&#8221;And the amazing thing is the story still works. With just a couple more tweaks, like updating the executives in the article, this actually could be a launch post for the NYTimes on the iPad. In fact it works so well that the NYTimes didn&#8217;t get the point. One NYTimes writer even happily retweeted the post. So you see, the more things change, the more things stay the same. The World Wide Web didn&#8217;t save the New York Times. And neither will the iPad.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/nytimes-request-correctionremoval-of-our-post-we-decline/","2010-04-01","4","38","249","168","3.572614","5.125000","624.00000","0.00000"
"4","Google Shows How HTML5 Can Run Quake In The Browser","Erick Schonfeld","3","26","A lot of attention lately has been put on the video capabilities of HTML5 browsers, since the iPad doesn&#8217;t support Flash.  It turns out not to really matter that much because most online video platforms are now drinking the HTML5 Kool-Aid.  But what about other things that Flash does well, like games?  Well, HTML5 might be a more powerful game engine than most peopel think.To show off what is possible with HTML5 in the browser, some of the engineers on the Google Web Toolkit team created an HTML5 port of the classic first-person shooter game Quake II.  Check it out in the video above.  It is based on an open-sourced Java port of Quake called Jake2.  A post on the Google Code blog explains how they did it:We started with the existing Jake2 Java port of the Quake II engine, then used the Google Web Toolkit (along with WebGL, WebSockets, and a lot of refactoring) to cross-compile it into Javascript. You can see the results in the video above &#8212; we were honestly a bit surprised when we saw it pushing over 30 frames per second on our laptops (your mileage may vary)!It works only on &#8220;modern browsers such as Safari and Chrome&#8221; and you can find the code here.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try it out.  If you can get it to work, tell us what you think in comments.  I really hope this isn&#8217;t April Fool&#8217;s joke.

"5","The iPad: Apple&#8217;s Trojan Horse","John Biggs","4","49","Something struck me about Apple&#8217;s handling of the iPad launch this week. Instead of countless nerds spouting off in early reviews, only a few major tech press folks got early samples. Instead, the iPad showed up in a show the missus and I watch, Modern Family.* That&#8217;s right: instead of an overfed talking-head tech reporter pawing over the iPad on morning TV, the iPad got prime-time coverage in a sitcom. Think about the last computer company to get that kind of screen time. Only Microsoft, in their abysmal product placement in Family Guy comes to mind. But in Modern Family the iPad was a major plot point. While I&#8217;m sure Apple paid a pretty penny for the exposure, I don&#8217;t doubt the folks at ABC would have put the product in for free had Apple asked.But this shows a very important turning point in Apple marketing. The company, in short, sees the iPad as a mass market phenomenon without peer and is treating it as such. And the iPad, in turn, will become the tool that pushes Apple even deeper into the home.The iPhone convinced millions of people that Apple makes nice phones. The iPad, in turn, will convince millions of people that Apple makes nice computers. Whereas the &#8220;halo effect&#8221; that the iPhone was supposed to have on the rest of Apple&#8217;s wares &#8211; laptops and iMacs and the line &#8211; isn&#8217;t quite apparent except in Apple&#8217;s impressive revenues, I suspect the iPad is going to push people over the hump. While you can get away with booting up craggy old Windows on your craggy old Dell while mucking about in iPhone&#8217;s sylvan glades, you&#8217;re less likely to appreciate your old laptop when its sitting alongside a device that looks like a cross between a robotic communion wafer and something out of Star Trek.To describe this metaphorically, (and this is a horrible metaphor) think of the iPhone as a bicycle made by BMW. No one is going to upgrade to a Ford car if you&#8217;re only used to their bikes but if Ford starts to sell, say, something like an inexpensive Smart car or nice motorcycle with a little more power and all that BMW &#8220;magic,&#8221; there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll buy a Z-Series next time they&#8217;re looking at cars.So the reason you&#8217;re not seeing geeks like us with iPads this week is simple &#8211; the iPad isn&#8217;t for geeks like us. While time will tell if this is a correct assessment, I&#8217;m almost betting on it.UPDATE &#8211; I found some things to add. First, Apple has 91% market share in &#8220;premium PCs,&#8221; which is huge. But in lower-end PCs Windows still rules. Now what happens when a sub-$700 Apple ends up in millions of homes. Much more market share and a real halo effect across the market.*It&#8217;s seriously a really good program. Christopher LLoyd (Frasier and Wings) produces it. I thought it would be dumb at first too. Try it.","http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/01/the-ipad-apples-trojan-horse/","2010-04-01","1","49","503","348","3.773279","5.356322","200.00000","0.00000"
"6","Blippy Does An End Run, Harnesses Gmail OAuth To Re-Enable Amazon Support","Jason Kincaid","1","13","Early this year, Blippy, the highly controversial startup that lets you share your credit card and online purchases with your friends, ran into some trouble with Amazon.com.  Namely, Amazon told Blippy to stop pulling in user purchase information, and to go back and erase all existing data they&#8217;d already sucked in.  Today, Blippy users have regained the ability to share their Amazon purchases, but this time, Blippy doesn&#8217;t need Amazon&#8217;s permission.The new Amazon integration requires users to grant Blippy access to their Gmail accounts via OAuth (this only works with Gmail, though the site says it plans to support other email services soon). After linking your Gmail to Blippy, the service will automatically scan your account for Amazon receipts, which it will use to display the items you&#8217;ve purchased in your Blippy feed.  When I asked Blippy co-founder Philip Kaplan if they had Amazon&#8217;s approval, he said they didn&#8217;t ask for it, and they weren&#8217;t sure they needed it, either.The addition of Gmail OAuth support could mean big things for Blippy.  Because Blippy now has a relatively secure way to access your Gmail, it can add support for a plethora of online vendors who may not offer an API. Likewise, Blippy could use the same method to do end runs around services that don&#8217;t want Blippy tracking purchases in the first place.To be clear, OAuth is no magic bullet for keeping your data secure — you&#8217;re essentially giving Blippy the ability to monitor your Email. But users are already handing over their login credentials for plenty of services to Blippy, which is potentially an even worse security issue (with OAuth, they don&#8217;t actually store your password).Thanks to Mark Hendrickson for the tipCrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/blippy-amazon/","2010-04-01","1","13","299","221","4.393728","5.705882","56.00000","0.00000"
"7","FreshPlanet Debuts With An iPad Game, Plus $1.5 Million From Clavier And French Angels","Erick Schonfeld","3","5","If you are going to launch a gaming startup this week, you might as well make your first game for the iPad.  FreshPlanet is a stealthy startup looking to make its public debut with the launch of an educational game for children, Red Fish, on the iPad (iTunes link).FreshPlanet is based in New York City and founded by two serial entrepreneur French brothers, Mathieu and Romain Nouzareth.  It recently raised a $1.5 million Series A from Jeff Clavier&#8217;s SofTech VC and a bunch of French angel investors including Jacques Antoine Granjon (founder of Ventes-privees), Xavier Niel (founder of French ISP Free.fr), and Oleg Tscheltzoff (founder of Fotolia) via CapISF.  Mathieu and Romain previously founded online game distribution service Boonty (sold t French company Nexway) and casual gaming site Cafe.com.Red Fish is based on a popular French kid&#8217;s learning Website called Poisson Rouge.  FreshPlanet licensed the game and developed a version specifically for the iPad to start.  There is no iPhone version.  &#8220;The big screen is much more interesting for us,&#8221; says Romain.Red Fish teaches kids between 3 and 7 to count, read, spell, and even compose music all using the iPad&#8217;s engaging touchscreen.  The app is free and comes with 12 different activities, but to unlock the rest (there are 50 total) will cost $9.99.  You can watch a demo of the app in the video below.  It gives you a good sense of how the iPad can become an educational game platform.  Kids love touchscreens (mine are always fooling with my iPhone), and big touchscreens with games designed for them could prove irresistible. FreshPlanet is also testing a music quiz game on Facebook, and plans to design games for both Facebook, the iPad, and the iPhone.

"8","Twitter Tweaks Search, A Few Popular Tweets Now At The Top Of Results","MG Siegler","5","3","As you may have noticed when Twitter introduced its new homepage a few days ago, Twitter has a new feature that allows them to group together popular tweets. They say this is done algorithmically, and have an account to capture them all here. Now they&#8217;re just turned on this feature on for Twitter search, and its API.As you can see in the search.twitter.com page (but not yet on Twitter.com&#8217;s own search), there are three pinned popular tweets at the top of the results (Twitter notes that it could be less than three, but that three is the max right now). Below each of these, you can see the number of times the tweet was retweeted, giving some indication of why it&#8217;s popular.A message today sent from developer advocate Taylor Singletary to the Twitter development and API Google Groups lets everyone know about the change. He also seems to reveal the keys behind the popularity algorithm:With this new project, we want to make real-time search even more valuable by surfacing the best tweets about a particular topic, by considering recency, but also the interactions on a tweet. This means analyzing the author&#8217;s profile, as well as the number times the tweet has been retweeted, favorited, replied, and more. It&#8217;s an evolving algorithm that we&#8217;ll be iterating on &amp; tuning until practically the end of time.Further, this search change is coming to the API too. Singletary says this feature will be opt-in for developers during this current phase. But it sounds like eventually this will be a standard part of the search API (that undoubtedly developers can choose to leave out if they want to). Here&#8217;s how the results will break down for those who do opt-in:mixed &#8211; receive both &#8220;popular tweets&#8221; and most recent tweets for the query. This is the equivalent of the future default behavior.popular &#8211; receive only &#8220;popular tweets&#8221; for the query.recent &#8211; receive only recent results for the query. This is the equivalent of the behavior you&#8217;ve come to expect until presentTo make this new feature work, each tweet now has a new bit of metadata letting the search query know if it&#8217;s &#8220;popular&#8221; or &#8220;recent.&#8221; Singletary also notes that in the future other metadata layers may be added to further augment results.That seems like a pretty interesting way to make Twitter search more useful and less filled with spam.Update: Twitter has now added popular results to Twitter.com as well. Check out the screenshots below — it&#8217;s less obvious than search.twitter.com but the metadata is there.[thanks Alex]CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/twitter-popular-tweet-search/","2010-04-01","0","3","446","300","4.004673","5.713333","0.00000","0.00000"
"9","Behind The Scenes Of YouTube&#8217;s ASCII Prank","Jason Kincaid","1","8","Today, millions of people around the world were introduced to TEXTp, a new video display format created by YouTube that converts the site&#8217;s videos into a flurry of ASCII characters.  The new format, which was implemented as a cost-saving measure, is saving YouTube $1 per second of content watched in bandwidth costs.Of course, TEXTp is just the latest April Fools prank to come from YouTube (past pranks have included Rick Rolling all of its users and flipping the site upside down).  Yesterday, I had a chance to sit down with some of the people behind this year&#8217;s prank.  Along with explaining how they actually got these ASCII-ized videos working, they also detailed YouTube&#8217;s process for figuring out which pranks get shown to the world. Be sure to check out our full list of other April Fools jokes here.So how did YouTube convert all of its videos to streaming lines of text?  The company leveraged a piece of its existing and seemingly unrelated technology: their 3D video player. Engineer Peter Bradshaw, who is behind the site&#8217;s 3D viewer, says that fellow engineer Blake Livingston adapted his work with Adobe&#8217;s  Pixel Bender (which is used to achieve the 3D effect) to convert the videos into ASCII.Billy Biggs, another software engineer at YouTube (who claims pranks are his full time job), also played a key role in the project.  Bradshaw initially hacked the effect together in one evening, but it took around three weeks for the prank team to get that &#8216;last 10%&#8217; done.The pranksters say that the idea had actually been circling at YouTube for over a year, and that there were many other pranks proposed.  In fact, each YouTube employee is invited to submit their idea in the months leading up to April 1.  To choose which one is actually deployed to users, YouTube uses Google&#8217;s Moderator tool.  After voting concludes, a smaller panel made up of engineers, product managers, and PR reps congregates to figure out which ideas are feasible (and won&#8217;t offend anyone).The prank team didn&#8217;t take this too lightly, either: as I left the the conference room yesterday afternoon, the team was still tweaking TEXTp, trying to hone in on the optimal font size and color palette while waging a war against the letter &#8216;M&#8217;, which had the nasty habit of showing up too often.If ASCII art is your thing, you may also be interested in ASCIImeo, an ASCIIized version of Vimeo.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/youtube-ascii-april-fools/","2010-04-01","2","8","419","303","4.077670","5.544554","72.00000","0.00000"
"10","The App Store Is Now Completely iPad-Crazy Like The Rest Of Us","MG Siegler","5","36","Have you been doing various searches or combing through the pages the full iPad app directory since those apps started going live earlier? Well stop — because Apple has just completely revamped the App Store to be iPad-centric.As you can see in the screenshot above, the front page of the App Store is now dominated by iPad apps. Yes, the iPad apps that 99.99% of the world cannot use yet because no one outside of a select few testers has the actual device. But that isn&#8217;t stopping Apple from promoting the hell out of these apps. And it&#8217;s working — at least for me. I&#8217;ve already bought a ton of them, and I don&#8217;t have an iPad yet.Humorously, Apple is promoting a bunch of apps that it has asked developers to create embargoes for, for the press. Earlier today, Apple moved that embargo time up from Saturday morning (the actual iPad launch) to tomorrow morning, undoubtedly because they knew they&#8217;d be rolling these App Store changes live. Still, Apple is already showing a ton of embargoed apps on its &#8220;New &amp; Noteworthy,&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot,&#8221; and &#8220;Staff Favorites&#8221; areas. As you can see, Apple has added a button to toggle between iPhone and iPad apps for each area (as well as the charts portion).Oh, and all of the featured areas on the main App Store page are currently iPad apps too except for the one App Store on Facebook promotion. This includes the main banner area which is shuffling through iPad apps such as Labyrinth 2, ABC&#8217;s streaming app, OmniGraffle, the WSJ app, and Apple&#8217;s own iWork apps.A few other iPad apps Apple is featuring include the Netflix app (yes, it&#8217;s real), Epicurious, and the Pandora app.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/ipad-app-store/","2010-04-01","0","35","304","216","3.955017","5.291667","0.00000","0.00000"
"11","And now we wait for someone to jailbreak the iPad","Devin Coldewey","6","26","Whether you&#8217;re excited about the iPad or not, you really have to admit that it&#8217;s a beautiful piece of hardware. What people disagree about is whether it&#8217;s worth having around, what with Apple&#8217;s chokehold on content and the limited inputs. Hell yeah, it is! But for flicking my way through word documents, watching scaled-down HD content in mono, and designing presentations? Nah.It&#8217;s not until one of the thousands of hackers out there, with teeth sharpened on jailbroken iPhone apps, gets their iPad and cracks the mother wide open, that we&#8217;re going to have the real fun. And I have reason to believe that&#8217;s going to happen mighty fast.Why do you think Apple neglected to include USB slots and an SD card slot? Because obviously they want you to buy the pre-approved games and apps from the App Store. Sure, those will be nice. Tower defense games are going to be fun as hell, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the big Diablo-esque dungeon crawler that&#8217;s surely in development. But brother, I want to play me some arcade games! I want a custom file browser, and support for obscure video formats! I want unfettered access to the device I just paid $500 for!The single input is the big issue, but the dock is essentially a USB-to-iPad cable. Sync everything over that, even &mdash; dare I dream &mdash; driver support for multiple wireless controllers? I&#8217;m thinking how perfect this thing is for couch or travel gaming &mdash; but I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to limit myself to the App Store. Bring on the DOS emulators. Bring on dual-boot with Chrome OS.The limitations are very few. With the iPhone, it still had to function as an iPhone &mdash; adding forbidden functionality on top of that was difficult and broke often. But the iPad is far less tethered to its OS, and I get the feeling that&#8217;s going to result in a bonanza for people willing to hack it.See, here&#8217;s the thing. It&#8217;s not just that the iPad is a great device. You may or may not think it is; personally, I think it&#8217;s incomplete and compromised by Apple&#8217;s control fetish. If I pay $500 for this thing, I&#8217;m not buying an Apple product, I&#8217;m buying a beautiful touchscreen device that has hackers and developers the world over drooling over the possibilities. You may dislike that it&#8217;s the Applest Apple product ever to come out, but you can&#8217;t argue with the numbers being sold and the hardware itself. Decent CPU, discrete GPU, responsive touchscreen, familiar resolution &mdash; it&#8217;s a tablet computer, whether Apple wants to let you use it as one or not. I don&#8217;t know about you guys, but in my world, the consumer decides what the device is for, and the iPad is a great place to prove it.","http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/01/and-now-we-wait-for-someone-to-jailbreak-the-ipad/","2010-04-01","0","22","482","325","3.811563","5.476923","0.00000","0.00000"

It&#8217;s Very Real, And It&#8217;s Very Live","MG Siegler","5","53","Seeing as today is April Fools Day, no one seems to have any idea which stories to believe and which to think are bogus. Yesterday, the blog AppAdvice had an exclusive story that Netflix was bringing a free app to stream movies to the iPad. Plenty of people thought this was just an early April Fools joke because, quite frankly, it seemed almost too good to be true. But it is very true. The app is now live in the App Store.Assuming you&#8217;re a Netflix member, the new iPad app lets you watch as many movies as you want (assuming they&#8217;re available on Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly service) streaming to the device. Yes, this gives you access to some 20,000+ movies and television shows. You can also browse movies and manage your queue from the app. And you can even pick up watching them from where you left off on your TV or computer.And since the iPad is currently WiFi-only, you don&#8217;t have to worry about streaming over 3G, so performance should be good. It will be interesting to see what happens with this app when the WiFi + 3G models of the iPad hit later this month.And yes, the app is currently iPad-only — there is no iPhone or iPod touch version. At least not yet.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/netflix-ipad/","2010-04-01","3","49","235","155","3.607306","5.096774","600.00000","0.00000"
"13","Conde Nast Cooks Up A Tasty Digital Cookbook With The Epicurious iPad App","Leena Rao","7","6","We&#8217;ve heard about Conde Nast&#8217;s plans for iPad apps to showcase the publisher&#8217;s magazine content but with the release of apps on Apple&#8217;s App Store ahead of Saturday&#8217;s iPad launch, I found a gem of an app that would satisfy the tastes of any cook out there. Epicurious, which combines the content of shuttered magazine Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Self and user generated recipes, is a popular recipe database that features over 100,000 recipes, menus, articles, food guides and more. The cooking site&#8217;s companion, free iPad app just launched, and as an avid cook, it looks like a winner.The app, which is similar in features to its sister iPhone app, is essentially a tabbed digital cookbook which allows you to access 27,000 recipes from both Gourmet and Bon Appetit. You can browse recipe collections, search via keyword, and filter your searches by what&#8217;s in your fridge, seasonal foods, holidays and more. You can add any recipe to your favorites box to save it as well as email recipes to yourself and others. You can also add ingredients from your saved recipes to shopping lists and check off items as you buy them. What would be really useful is if your accounts on your iPhone and iPad apps could sync so that you could use your iPhone for your shopping lists on the go, and use your iPad for browsing recipes and to visualize recipes in the kitchen. Another compelling feature would be the ability for other users (i.e. a husband, wife or roommate) to add to the shopping list from a different device. At this point it&#8217;s unclear if you can sync accounts between devices. The nature of the iPad may breathe new life into cooking and recipe apps. While reading recipes on the iPhone and other mobile devices while cooking can be tough; the iPad’s large screen simulates a digital cookbook. And we all know that the iPad will be used as an e-book, allowing users to download and access cookbooks directly from their device in addition to using apps like Epicurious&#8217; offering. According to a recent survey conducted by Epicurious competitor AllRecipes, one out of five people bring their laptops into the kitchen to access recipes. However, the drawback to the iPad entering the kitchen is that it is a dangerous place for a laptop, with significant threats of spills onto keyboards. But the iPad should come with protective screens and stands, making it safer to use in the chaos of the kitchen. AllRecipes is also planning to launch an iPad app in the near future.Epicurious isn&#8217;t the only Conde Nast property with an iPad app to make into the store ahead of time. GQ&#8217;s app hit the App Store today and costs $2.99 to download.

"14","RethinkDB Raises $1.2 Million For Its Database For Solid-State Drives","Jason Kincaid","1","3","RethinkDB, the startup that&#8217;s looking to provide a MySQL storage engine that&#8217;s been built from the ground up for solid-state drives, has closed a $1.2 million seed funding round.  The roster of investors taking part in the round is impressive: Highland Capital Partners, Avalon Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Charles River Ventures are all participating. Angel investors in the round include Brian Pokorny (formerly of SV Angel and now CEO of DailyBooth), FriendFeed founder Paul Buchheit, Udi Manber (a Google VP who is in charge of the company&#8217;s all-important core search offerings), YouTube founder Steve Chen, Russell Siegelman, angel investor and previously a partner at KPCB, and Dave Pell.  RethinkDB had previously taken early funding as part of last summer&#8217;s Y Combinator program.Solid-state drives — the kind of disk that you&#8217;ll find in your iPhone —  likely represent the future of storage.  Not only do SSDs do away with the moving parts associated with traditional platter based drives; they&#8217;re also fast. RethinkDB is looking to be at the head of the curve by offering a fully optimized MySQL storage engine that takes advantage of the benefits offered by SSDs.  Among the features listed on their site: append-only algorithms, lock-free concurrency, and live schema changes (you can see more technical details here).There&#8217;s obviously risk involved with trying to redefine how people structure their databases (this seems like the sort of thing that will either never gain traction or become very successful), and the company&#8217;s strong roster of investors represents a big vote of confidence.  Update: Actually, as the comments point out, RethinkDB is meant to be easy to deploy.  RethinkDB plans to use the new funding to add developers to its still-small team.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/rethinkdb-raises-1-2-million-for-its-database-for-solid-state-drives/","2010-04-01","0","3","293","210","4.650177","6.266667","0.00000","0.00000"
"15","With 50 Million Users, Pandora Looks To Make Beautiful Music On The iPad","MG Siegler","5","17","The iPad isn&#8217;t launching until Saturday, but many of the apps for it are already live (even ones under embargo). That includes one of the most popular apps of all time for the iPhone: Pandora. Based on the App Store description and screenshots, you can expect Pandora to be one of the top apps on the iPad as well.Version 3.0 of Pandora is a Universal app, meaning it includes builds for the iPhone and iPad. Those who have the app installed (likely most of you with an iPhone or iPod touch) probably downloaded the update automatically today through iTunes. So what&#8217;s in it? Well, obviously there is a completely redesigned interface for the iPad (see screenshots below). But Pandora has also added album artwork to the station list across all the platforms. Perhaps most significantly, Pandora has also improved the audio streaming across the board. This means faster start times and fewer dropouts.The iPad version takes advantage of the large 9.7 inch screen of the device. Rather than having to switch views to see things such as your stations, they can reside on the left hand side of the screen as your album artwork and artist information is on the right hand side. Artist information is a particular area of emphasis with this new app. The top player looks similar to iTunes now, with play and pause buttons, as well as thumbs up and thumbs down buttons. There is also an easy-to-access search box along the top.On top of the new iPad app, Pandora CTO Tom Conrad tweeted earlier today that the service has just signed up its 50 millionth user (up from 40 million this past December). Good timing, they&#8217;re potentially about to get a whole lot more from this new device.Find Pandora in the App Store here. It&#8217;s a free download.

Today, it revealed its first set of partners to incorporate the Facebook Ads API into their own products.  In addition to Clickable (which we discovered earlier), the other partners are Alchemy, Glow, Kenshoo, Marin Software, Omniture, and TBG.All of them variously help to manage and optimize ad campaigns across the Web. Advertisers who already use these tools, can now create and manage their Facebook ads alongside their other types of ads.  All of this is done via the Facebook Ad API.The more that Facebook can get its ad system to work with the existing ad technology out there, the easier it will be for advertisers to start trying out campaigns on Facebook.  Opening up its Ads APIs, though, also puts extra pressure on Facebook to prove that its ads can perform just as well or better than ads elsewhere on the Web.  Advertisers who run their ads through these management and analytics tools can see the relative performance of each type of ad and adjust their budgets accordingly.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/omniture-facebook-ads/","2010-04-01","0","0","206","153","4.292929","5.555556","0.00000","0.00000"
"17","Boom! Apple Breaks Its Own Embargoes On Hundreds Of iPad Apps","MG Siegler","5","10","Maybe you&#8217;ve heard that Apple has this new device coming out on Saturday. It seems to be a pretty big deal that will get a tsunami of press coverage without Apple lifting a finger. But just in case, Apple has decided to embargo several iPad apps (and maybe most of them), so they can&#8217;t talk to the press before Apple tells them its okay. The only problem? Apple today unleashed all of their apps in the App Store already. Yes, Apple has broken its own embargo — hundreds of them. Awesome.Initially, Apple had set a Saturday morning embargo for these approved iPad apps to coincide with the iPad availability. But today, Apple apparently moved up the embargo time to early tomorrow morning, we&#8217;re told. But again, they&#8217;re actually already in the App Store now, complete with pictures and descriptions. So anyone who wants to write about any of these apps can just scan the store and write away.Even better, plenty of apps, if they&#8217;re Universal (meaning bundled with both an iPad and iPhone versions), are already auto-updating, so you probably have several iPad apps already even if you don&#8217;t realize it. Naturally, you can&#8217;t use the iPad versions until you have the device, but they&#8217;re right there on your machine.Apple, we hate embargoes too, so we think your undermining them is just great.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/apple-ipad-app-embargoes/","2010-04-01","1","9","239","181","4.207048","5.276243","40.00000","0.00000"
"18","The New York Times Introduces An iPad App","Andy Brett","8","28","The New York Times will begin publishing daily on the iPad, offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper&#8217;s contents.The New York Times on the iPad, as the electronic publication is known, contains most of the news and feature articles from the current day&#8217;s printed newspaper, classified advertising, reporting that does not appear in the newspaper, and interactive features including the newspaper&#8217;s crossword puzzle.The iPad App (address: http:/www.nytimes.com) is part of a strategy to extend the readership of The Times and to create opportunities for the company in the electronic media industry, said Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic Media Company.The company, formed in 1995 to develop products for the rapidly growing field of digital publishing, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The New York Times Company, and also produces the times service on America Online Inc.Mr. Nisenholtz reports to Russell T. Lewis, the president and general manager of The New York Times, and to Joseph Lelyveld, the newspaper&#8217;s executive editor.The iPad-based Times is the newest of dozens of papers available to a global audience on the Internet&#8217;s fastest-growing service, which lets iPad users see electronic publications consisting of text, pictures and, in some cases, video and sound.A selection of the day&#8217;s news, discussion forums and other material from The Times has been available through the @times service since the spring of 1994 on America Online.The iPad&#8217;s global audience means a larger potential readership than that of @times, which is limited to America Online&#8217;s subscribers, currently more than four million. The new site also offers new products and services.&#8220;Our iPad App is designed to take full advantage of the evolving capabilities offered by the Internet,&#8221; said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times. &#8220;We see our role on the iPad as being similar to our traditional print role &#8212; to act as a thoughtful, unbiased filter and to provide our customers with information they need and can trust.&#8221;The iPad will also offer access to much of what the newspaper has published the previous week and access to feature articles from as far back as 1980.Mr. Nisenholtz said that initially, at least, no subscription or access fee would be charged for readers in the United States and that the iPad App would generate revenue from advertising. Readers who connect to the iPad App from outside the country will be offered a 30-day trial without charge, but will eventually face a subscription fee.Advertisers that have already announced participation on the iPad App include Toyota Motor Corporate Services, Chemical Bank and the Northeast real estate concern Douglas Elliman.Subscribers will have limited access to archives of Times articles and features dating to 1980, and will be able to copy articles to their own iPads for $1.95 each, Mr. Nisenholtz said.The new service will also offer, for a fee, a customized clipping service that delivers to a subscriber&#8217;s electronic mailbox articles gleaned from each day&#8217;s editions of the newspaper, based on key words the subscriber selects.With its entry on the iPad, The Times is hoping to become a primary information provider in the computer age and to cut costs for newsprint, delivery and labor. Companies that have established iPad-based information sites include television networks, computer companies, on-line information services, magazines and even individuals creating electronic newspapers of their own.&#8220;The New York Times name will get people to look at the product once or maybe twice, and the fact that The New York Times has the kind of reach and credibility it does may persuade people to look three or four times,&#8221; said John F. Kelsey 3d, president of the Kelsey Group, a consultancy running a conference on iPad Apps next month.&#8220;The market is booming for newspapers on the iPad,&#8221; Mr. Kelsey said.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/new-york-times-ipad/","2010-04-01","4","27","651","449","4.323988","6.182628","448.00000","0.00000"

We&#8217;ve seen dozens of brands sign up with Foursquare to promote things, and they&#8217;re starting to embrace Gowalla in a major way too. The latest three are: Adobe, Chipotle, and the New Jersey Nets.Today at his Where 2.0 talk in San Jose, CA, Gowalla CEO Josh Williams unveiled Adobe&#8217;s plan to use the service&#8217;s signature stamps to give away a dozen copies of their new Creative Suite 5 software. These stamps will be hidden in various places all around America. To find one, you simply check-in to a venue and it will appear on your screen. You can then hit a button to get the details for how to redeem it for a copy of the software.Additionally, Gowalla is teaming up with the big Mexican food chain Chipotle to give users stamps at over 1,000 locations across the U.S. Currently, these stamps are just to pretty-up your profile, but eventually these are undoubtedly part of Gowalla&#8217;s larger plan to be able to trade these in for free items in stores.Finally, the New Jersey Nets are working with Gowalla to give away 500 tickets to their final home game against the Chicago Bulls taking place on April 12. Sure, the Nets may be the worst team in the NBA, but it would still be hard to pass up on a free game.Yesterday, I moderated a panel at Where 2.0 with both Gowalla and Foursquare on it, as well as Loopt, Plancast, and Twitter.

We&#8217;ve confirmed the funding, which was raised a year ago, with the company. This brings the social network&#8217;s funding up to $38 million. Hi5, which has been actively remodeling its site to cater to the gaming industry, says this funding is part of a larger Series B round. Another undisclosed investor will be leading the round.

Last fall, the social network launched a totally revamped site that places a much stronger emphasis on games and virtual currency, along with a new avatar system. As we&#8217;ve written in the past, with the massive success of Zynga and Playfish, it makes sense that hi5 would try to create a social network that centers around gaming itself. hi5 has over 60 million members, which is a far cry from Facebook&#8217;s 400 million users. In December, hi5 brought on a new president, gaming industry veteran, Alex St. John, to help lead the social network&#8217;s efforts.

"23","Review: enTourage eDGe dualbook","Scott Merrill","9","17","To say that the enTourage eDGe dualbook is &#8220;just an e-reader with a bolted-on netbook&#8221; (or vice versa) is to pretty dramatically miss the entire point of this thing. The eDGe exists in a category all by itself, because it does an awful lot more than just an e-reader or just a netbook. As a unique product, there are a couple of unfortunate shortcomings, but on the whole the dualbook represents an exciting glimpse at new ways to access and use technology and content. Devin pooh-poohed the eDGe recently, but I&#8217;m pretty excited about it.Short VersionThe enTourage eDGe is a functional, easy-to-use device that currently defies formal classification. It&#8217;s primarily going to be useful to academics and people who spend a lot of time in books, but need more convenience than that offered by separate e-book reader and laptop. It has some warts, but offers surprising value in a first-generation device.FeaturesThe left half of the eDGe is the e-reader.9.7 inch display1200 x 825 pixelsuses e-Ink® technologytouch-sensitive, allowing for handwritten notes or sketchesThe right half of the eDGe is an Android-powered touchscreen netbook.10.1 inch display1024 x 600 pixelsincludes an audio recorder to capture lectures for later playback or sharinghas a video camera to record still images or movies as MP4s or 3GP filescan toggle between landscape and portrait orientationThe whole package:two USB ports for connecting peripherals,  one SD card slotone USB port to connect your eDGe to your computer as a removable deviceWiFi and Bluetoothuser-replaceable batteryMSRP $499Prose-ink display makes reading e-books extremely easy on the eyestouchscreen notebook is easy to usegood battery lifepowered by Android!ConsSlow boot timeno access to Android marketplace, currentlyhard-to-use eDGe bookstore, currentlyFull ReviewMy fourteen minute video above shows some of the neat features of this new device.At three-ish pounds, the weight of the unit is not too bad. The construction is fair, but frankly it doesn&#8217;t feel quite as rugged as I would like. The two halves do not lock in any way &#8212; neither mechanical nor magnetic &#8212; so when it&#8217;s &#8220;closed&#8221; it pops open just a little bit. The hinges are not loose, though, so it&#8217;s not like the eDGe flips open in the same way a real book does: you need to actually open it.The GoodThe integration of netbook and e-reader is very well done. Navigating the library on the netbook portion allows you to see your available texts without affecting the currently displayed book. So if you merely want to look up the title of another work in your library without actually leaving your current selection, for example, you can.Battery life is good, especially if you manually lock the touchscreen portion of the unit: this allows you to use the e-reader portion for considerably longer periods.The dual-screen and dual-functionality of the dualbook allow for more than just &#8220;reading e-books + some other task&#8221;, like reading email or taking notes or looking up details on Wikipedia. It allows rich content to be embedded in an e-book that can be accessed on the touchscreen: you can send selections from the e-reader screen to the netbook screen. You can select a portion of the book you&#8217;re reading &#8212; whether a section of text, or an embedded image &#8212; and view it on the netbook screen, with the added ability to zoom in and zoom out. The zoom doesn&#8217;t improve the quality, unfortunately, so since most PDFs and e-books drastically compress their images, zooming in merely displays a big jagged image. Hopefully this situation will improve over time, and higher fidelity images will be embedded in e-books.There&#8217;s an interesting application for this feature, though: being able to review a figure or diagram separate from the page on which it is displayed. In academic contexts, this can be a really useful ability. Whether you&#8217;re studying physics or art, you can keep an image or diagram open on the right while you continue to read the text on the left. No more flipping back and forth between pages to refer back to a figure. In addition to viewing images as described above, video and audio files can also be linked to and accessed from the e-books.Notes can be added to e-books, and those notes can be viewed on the touchscreen in an indexed display. This lets you review annotations you may have made to a work, and jump straight to a specific portion of the e-text. You type up a note on the touchscreen side of the unit, so you don&#8217;t lose sight of what you&#8217;re reading.The e-book screen can toggle between displaying an e-book and becoming a free writing surface. Using the stylus you can handwrite notes, sketch, doodle, do long division, or whatever. Anything you create in this way can be exported to PDF, so you can share your creations with others, or just keep an archive of your work.The BadThe unique form factor of the dualbook takes some getting used to. I found it equally comfortable to use the device in both &#8220;full open&#8221; and &#8220;folded over&#8221; configurations, though it took me awhile to find where to put my hands so that my fingers and thumbs didn&#8217;t accidentally hit the buttons. My understanding is that this is a pretty common complaint against most e-readers.Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the eDGe currently is its use of Android. Android was designed for mobile phones, and the eDGe is not a mobile phone. This has interesting consequences. The first is that the eDGe is prohibited from accessing the Marketplace in the normal fashion. Use the browser on the touchscreen, and try to find an app. Almost all links to apps use the market:// URL. Clicking any of these in the default eDGe browser produces an error that it doesn&#8217;t know how to handle that URL. If you can find a .apk Android package, you can load it manually onto the eDGe and install it, but this is currently a laborious process. According to Doug Atkinson, VP of marketing and business development at enTourage Systems, there are plans to build their own app marketplace, so that third-party Android apps can be easily installed. There is currently no ETA for this.Another side-effect of using Android, and the default browser, is that file uploads are disabled. Again, this is because Android is built for phones, and Android on phones doesn&#8217;t allow file uploads by default. (The same currently holds true for Safari on iPhone, incidentally.) Once enTourage&#8217;s app store opens up this may no longer be an issue, but the lack of file uploads does affect the usability of the eDGe in academic contexts. Many colleges and university have online course management systems through which students upload completed assignments. You won&#8217;t be able to upload anything from the eDGe right now, so it&#8217;s not going to completely replace your desktop or laptop computer.The other big problem with the eDGe is the eDGe bookstore. The interface you see using a desktop browser at www.entourageedge.com is not the interface you see when visiting that site from the eDGe itself. enTourage Systems has designed their book store to work reasonably well with the eDGe&#8217;s small screen and limited navigation controls. The problem is actually finding the content you want. If you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want, you&#8217;ll be required to sort through page after page after page of offerings: there is no way to sort by popularity, or publication date, or price, or author name, or title name. You can browse books by subject, but there&#8217;s no there&#8217;s no way to further refine the listing.  I don&#8217;t know how enTourage is sorting their books, but you&#8217;re forced to live with whatever organization they&#8217;ve chosen to use. Again, Doug Atkinson tells me that this will evolve over time, and that getting the store up was priority number one. Making the store better is priority number two, and hopefully will happen soon.This is my first real experience with an e-reader of any sort, so I&#8217;m probably just now discovering a lot of what other folks have already found. Like how crappy footnotes are, for example. The eDGe has this whole other screen available, but viewing a footnote in an e-book still requires me to move away from my place in the text on the e-reader side, read the footnote, then click back to the page I left. That&#8217;s stupid. I mean really stupid. Even without the use of the second screen, I don&#8217;t see why a footnote requires its own full-page content display. The e-reader screen clearly supports modal dialog boxes: I think footnotes should display in a pop dialog box.Another major problem with electronic content is ownership. You don&#8217;t own the books you buy. You have merely purchased the right to read the work on this device, and maybe on a couple of other devices. This really bothers me, because it strips away the privileges granted to us under the first-sale doctrine. When I finish reading a physical book, I can loan it to a friend to read. Or I can give it outright to them. Not so with e-books and DRM. This really, really bugs me. An interesting consequence of this situation is that the used textbook market will be completely eliminated in the digital realm, allowing textbook published to enjoy full price sales for each of their digital texts.ConclusionI might appear hyper-critical of the eDGe in this review, but that&#8217;s because I really want to see this thing succeed. I am excited by the possibilities that this form factor introduces, and I think the convergence of features in a product like this will provide better long-term functionality than shoe-horning either feature set into a form factor that doesn&#8217;t adequately support it. That is to say, tablets and netbooks don&#8217;t make good e-readers in my mind, and e-readers don&#8217;t make good general purpose Internet devices. Of course, the only constant is change, so it&#8217;s entirely possible that the eDGe will be leapfrogged by some new product within a year. And enTourage is a pretty new player in a very competitive field, so they may not be able to stand up against larger companies, should those larger companies decide to compete. But for now, I think the eDGe offers a very compelling product at a pretty good price.","http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/01/review-entourage-edge-dualbook/","2010-04-01","3","10","1754","1219","3.998854","5.724364","132.00000","0.00000"
"24","In Time For The iPad, Dude-Centric Video Network Break Media Boards The HTML5 Train","Leena Rao","7","7","It seems like every video-related site or service out there is jumping on the HTML5 bandwagon to ready their video offerings for the iPad. We&#8217;ve recently covered announcements from Ooyala, Brightcove,  Kyte, Delve Networks and MeFeedia. And broadcast giants NBC, ABC, and CBS are also throwing their hats in the ring to allow their online videos to stream on the device. Another video entertainment company is jumping into the mix- Break Media, a social video and entertainment site for guys, is formatting its editorial and video content for HTML5 video playback to ensure compatibility with the iPad and other devices. Video content on Break Media’s nine branded properties, which include Break.com, MadeMan, Chickipedia, Cage Potato, Holy Taco, Screen Junkies, and All Left Turns, will include the functionality of a Flash-based player but with HTML and JavaScript implementation. And any video ad units running on these sites can be transcoded into H.264 video playback, the standard format for the iPad and other HTML5 devices. Additionally, Break Media advertisers will now also be able to target video advertising specifically to the iPad. Break&#8217;s ad network has created customizable ad formats that work with the device. Break Media recently acquired gaming site FileFront and launched a campaign to upload more UGC to its video platform. The media network also  launched a new Twitter-focused web show, called Tweet Boxx.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/in-time-for-the-ipad-dude-centric-video-network-break-media-boards-the-html5-train/","2010-04-01","1","6","241","178","4.744493","6.050562","28.00000","0.00000"

The simplicity of the application and the unlimited mobility gives you the opportunity to instantly share your experience with your viewers and interact and communicate through the web- to-mobile chat. Share the world, Live and Mobile with Bambuser, visit www.bambuser.com. Bambuser is drawing comparisons to mobile videocasting service Qik. The major difference is the lower latency that bambuser offers due to different technical approaches. Another difference between the services is that Bambuser offers streaming both from your computer and mobile, while Qik only allows streaming from the mobile. In October 2009 Bambuser was the first of the live streaming start-ups to allow users to stream video directly from their mobiles to their Facebook Wall.AFTER PARTY/DRINKS SPONSORBootlawBootlaw is a free boot camp for emerging technology, internet and digital businesses and the professionals working in them who want to learn more about the legal issues they face.

As far as April Fool&#8217;s jokes go, the site is pretty convincing.  It&#8217;s actually not far off from some of the pitches we see for elitist group buying startups.  I was almost fooled, until I saw the umlaut (a bit much), and the fact that for each featured item, Groupöupon&#8217;s price is actually higher than the crossed-out original price.The luxury private sale site features items such as sleeves made from &#8220;ostrich neck, baleen, pressed toucan beak, snakeskin (heated), and mane&#8221; ($6,500 for just a pair of sleeves, shirt not included), a Sleke watch that &#8220;eliminates the most cumbersome element of traditional watches—the face&#8221; ($14,500 for a right-hand model, $18,000 for a left-hand one), crowns ($68,000), and a money collage ($250,000).Before you can join this exclusive buying gröup, you need to place your eye up to a &#8220;retinal scanner&#8221; on the site so that Groupöupon &#8220;can check your identity against our online database of confidential tax records.&#8221;  Prospective members are also asked to supply documentation showing their net worth, along with any of the following proofs of status:Domestic organizational chart (must show a minimum of 20-40 servants)Audio recording of you properly annunciating the dictionaryPhotos with celebrities and public officials are encouraged (photos taken at book signings will not be considered)Fitting records for white tuxedosSilver-mine deedsExplanation of how carats are used differently when measuring diamonds vs. when measuring ivorySex tapesThis one gets an A+.Here&#8217;s the definitive list of 2010 April Fools jokesCrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/groupoupon/","2010-04-01","1","6","277","199","4.526119","6.095477","28.00000","0.00000"
"27","Study: 52 Percent Of Bloggers Consider Themselves Journalists","Leena Rao","7","49","According to a new study released by PR Week and PR Newswire, 52% percent of bloggers surveyed consider themselves journalists. This is an increase from 2009’s study, when just one in three had the same opinion. However, despite this, only 20% of bloggers obtain the majority of their income from their blogs; which is an 4% increase from 2009. A few other stats caught our attention as well. When it comes to using blogs and social networks, like Twitter or Facebook, for research, 91% of bloggers and 68% of online reporters &#8220;always&#8221; or &#8220;sometimes&#8221; use blogs for research. But only 35% of newspaper and 38% of print magazine journalists surveyed use blogs or social networks for research purposesThe stats are even more interesting when it comes to using Twitter, which is often a place for breaking news and consumer trends, alone for research. 64% of bloggers and 36% of online reporters said they use Twitter as a research tool for stories. But only 19% of newspaper reporters and 17% of print magazine reporters use the microblogging network as a resource for research. Newspaper and print magazine reporters also source Twitter less frequently than their online counterparts with 19% and 22% saying they have used a Twitter post in a story, respectively. This is in contrast the higher use of sourcing Twitter for stories for bloggers (55%), online magazine/news (42%) and even TV news (48%).Here at TechCrunch, we rely on other blogs for research even more than traditional news outlets.  And we use Twitter as a tool not just for breaking news, but also to evaluate the sentiment of consumers about a particular product or service.  For example, my colleague MG Siegler used the breaking news of Tiger Woods’ car accident to show the inherent value of Twitter when it comes to the speed of reporting news.Photo Credit/Flickr/MikeLichtCrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/study-52-percent-of-bloggers-consider-themselves-journalists/","2010-04-01","9","40","320","224","4.131410","5.754464","1476.00000","0.00000"

We take a look at the most important findings for both the Exit Poll report by Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association, and Dow Jones VentureSource&#8217;s assessment of IPO and M&amp;A activity in the U.S. during the first three months of this year. Dow Jones VentureSource Title: U.S. Venture-Backed Company IPOs in First Quarter Match 2009 Total; M&amp;A Deal Activity Flat as Median Paid Picks UpSubtitle: M&amp;As and IPOs of VC-Backed Companies Net $4.7B in Q1; Time to Reach M&amp;A Still Low as Investors Sell Companies EarlierQ1 2010 according to Dow Jones VentureSource:- Eight U.S. venture-backed companies raised $711 million by going public on U.S. stock exchanges, matching the number of IPOs that occurred throughout 2009.- It took companies that went public during the first quarter a median of 10.4 years and $156 million in venture capital to achieve liquidity.- This is more than the median 7.9 years and $32 million in capital it took for companies to reach an IPO in 2009.- Corporations bought 77 companies for $4 billion through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), on par with the 77 deals that raised $3.4 billion during the same period last year and a far cry from the 109 deals completed during the first quarter of 2008.- The $27 million median amount paid for a venture-backed company in the most recent quarter is a 17% increase from the $23 million median paid during the same period in 2009.- It took a median of 5.4 years for a venture-backed company to reach liquidity via a merger or acquisition, 15% more than the 4.7-year median in the first quarter of 2009, but still less than the medians seen during the same period in 2007 and 2008, 6.1 and 6.6 years respectively.- Companies that exited during the first quarter raised a median of $19 million in venture capital before exiting through a merger or acquisition, a 19% increase from the $16 million median during the same period last year.Thomson Reuters / NVCA Title: Venture-Backed Exit Activity Shows Improved Signs of Life in Q1 2010Subtitle: All-time Record for Venture-backed M&amp;A Exits; Nearly All Venture-backed IPOs Trading Above Offer PriceQ1 2010 according to Thomson Reuters / NVCA:- The quarter ended with nine venture-backed IPOs and 111 M&amp;A transactions.- There were nine venture-backed IPOs valued at $936.2 million in the first quarter of 2010 quarter of 2009, more than double the amount raised during the fourth quarter of 2009.- Of the nine IPOs in the first quarter, eight were trading at or above their offering prices as of 3/31/2010.- Three of the eight IPO exits for the quarter were in the Biotechnology sector, accounting for a total of $310.5 million.- Forty-three venture-backed companies are currently filed for an initial public offering with the SEC.- 111 venture-backed M&amp;A deals were reported for the first quarter, 31 of which had an aggregate deal value of $5.6 billion.- The average disclosed deal value was $180.2 million.- This marks the biggest quarter for overall number of venture-backed M&amp;A exits since records began in 1975.- The information technology sector led the venture-backed M&amp;A landscape, with 81 deals and a disclosed total dollar value of $2.3 billion.- Within this sector, computer software and services and internet specific companies accounted for the bulk of the targets, with 35 and 26 transactions, respectively, across these sector subsets.- Deals bringing in the top returns, those with disclosed values greater than four times the venture investment, accounted for 45 percent of the total in the first quarter of 2010.- Venture-backed M&amp;A deals returned less than the amount invested accounted for 31 percent of the quarter&#8217;s total, on par with total in the previous quarter.And here&#8217;s a bonus report: JEGI&#8217;s Q1 2010 M&amp;A Results &#8211; Deal Activity and Transaction Value Up (PDF)CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/venture-backed-exit-activity-is-picking-up-again/","2010-04-01","0","4","686","484","4.315068","5.857438","0.00000","0.00000"
"30","NearVerse Raises $1 Million For Proximity Based Mobile Social Network","Leena Rao","7","12","Startup NearVerse, the developers of proximity based mobile social network LoKast, has raised $1 million in seed funding from Meakem Becker Venture Capital.  NearVerse is using funding to further develop LoKast to accelerate its connectivity beyond the capabilities of existing 3G or 4G carrier networks. Launched at SXSW few weeks ago, LoKast, which is actually short for “local-casting,” allows you to set up a profile that will list all of your photos, selected contacts, videos, web links and music on your mobile phone. You can select which content you’d like to include to the public and which content you’d like to keep private. When a LoKast user is in proximity (300 feet) of other LoKast users, the app will automatically discover other users nearby and allow the user to view and download their content. For example, you can see the iTunes library of any user who is in close proximity to you. You can choose to download a 30-second clip of any song to your own profile and can also follow the link to the iTunes store to purchase the music (LoKast collects an affiliate fee for this, of course). Similarly, you can download photos, videos and even contacts from other users into your profile. You’ll also soon be able to share apps on your phone with other users.The beauty of Lokast is that it has its own internal network; eliminating the need for 3G connectivity to run the app, as LoKast works in subways, underground and heavily congested areas such as stadiums, where 3G connectivity is unreliable. The startup’s app is effectively all network based and currently has five patents for its proprietary technology.LoKast is also partnering with bands to help market their content to users. LoKast has struck deals with music distribution companies including The Orchard, IODA and Monalis 360 to provide users with exclusive content within the LoKast app. And production companies, such as Mark Cuban’s Magnolia Pictures, are also using the service to promote their new films.And LoKast will soon be launching an Android app, and plans to launch integration with Facebook Connect. The app itself is incredibly simple to use and seems like it has potential to be a great way to share content on your mobile phone. Of course, some people may not feel comfortable sharing their personal content to complete strangers, so that may be a barrier for certain users.

"33","Joanna Shields to lead Facebook&#8217;s international assault","Mike Butcher","10","21","Facebook has been famously thin in terms of its international organisation. Visiting their London offices recently impressed upon me how few people they actually have in Europe. A few sales staff, a PR, receptionist etc. As far as I could tell, only the affable Christian Hernandez was doing anything in wider Europe, as Facebook&#8217;s international biz dev guy. So it&#8217;s not before time that it&#8217;s expanding its global sales organisation.Joanna Shields has re-emerged after recently exiting from her role at AOL, as Faceboook&#8217;s new VP of Sales and Business Development for EMEA.  Joanna was previously CEO of Bebo and President of People Platforms at AOL.Joanna was also the person who got advertising agencies to buy into Bebo, thus triggering its sale to AOL. We are talking one persuasive person here.Vice President EMEA at Facebook Blake Chandlee, who opened the London sales office, is now shifting over to lead a newly created role as Vice President of Sales for Emerging Markets focusing on Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  This is a smart move by Facebook.

Especially if you&#8217;re a blogger because you can pretty much write anything at all and get away with it. Google wants to nuke China? Yep, you can write that. Want to accuse the next attorney general of California of assaulting you? Check. Etc.And Google takes April Fools very seriously.  They launched Gmail on April 1, 2004, which is totally meta. And there are so many good Google jokes from April Fools past: Google Paper, Google TiSP, and Google Romance were all winners. One Google joke even erupted into a minor Wikipedia war over time travel.Google Topeka? Not so funny. They&#8217;ve changed their logo on the Google homepage to Topeka and give this link as an explanation. They&#8217;ve changed their corporate name, they say, to Topeka for the day.The problem is the whole joke is really just a way to promote Google&#8217;s experimental fiber network. 1,100 cities are begging to be part of the program and doing crazy things, like renaming their city name to Google, to get picked.We didn’t reach this decision lightly; after all, we had a fair amount of brand equity tied up in our old name. But the more we surfed around (the former) Topeka’s municipal website, the more kinship we felt with this fine city at the edge of the Great Plains.Anyway, if you&#8217;re promoting your own stuff on April Fools you need to be extra funny. This isn&#8217;t extra funny.And what happened to Google Jail? As far as I can tell it remains unannounced. Maybe they got mad that Fast Company scooped them on their own joke. Or maybe someone at Google decided it was a bad idea to mock the horrific prison situation here in the U.S.We&#8217;re grading this one an &#8220;D-&#8221; on our list of 2010 April Fools jokes.

Clickable, the ad management platform that lets search marketers measure and track the performance of their online marketing campaigns across different search engines and advertising networks, will be adding Facebook Ads as an option on April 12.What that means is that an advertiser buying pay-per-click ads on Google can test the performance of those search ads against pay-per-click ads on Facebook targeted to particular social demographics.  Search ads versus social ads, all in one dashboard.  According to this sign-up page on Clickable:Clickable Pro now empowers you to create and upload pay-per-click Facebook ads in bulk.

I actually think the service is pretty cool, I just think they drastically overpriced their iPhone app. The computational engine was trying to get users to pay $50 for the information they could access for free online. Sure, there&#8217;s something to be said for an iPhone-tailored experience, but $50 was just ridiculous. And guess who now agrees? WolframAlpha.The service has slashed — and I do mean slashed — the price of the app from $49.99 all the way down to $1.99. Yes, they&#8217;ve discounted it $48. That&#8217;s a 96% price reduction. And not just that — they&#8217;re offering a refund to anyone who did pay the ridiculous price for the app. Yes, a full refund — and Apple is keeping their 30%, so WolframAlpha is losing money by doing this.Between the $49.99 version and the $19.99 discounted version that was on sale during the holidays, 10,000 copies of the app were sold, we&#8217;re told. That&#8217;s not awful, but it&#8217;s nowhere near the number WolframAlpha needs to be ubiquitous. And that&#8217;s exactly what WolframAlpha has decided it wants to be.The $1.99 price will certainly help towards that goal, but so will the reinstatement of the mobile-optimized version of the site. You may recall that WolframAlpha took that version away in December, erroneously thinking people would buy the $50 app without it. Now, it&#8217;s back too.More changes to make WolframAlpha appeal to all sorts of people will be coming too, we&#8217;re told.For now, check out the handsomely-priced $1.99 app.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/wolframalpha-iphone-app/","2010-03-31","2","16","272","183","4.038314","5.759563","68.00000","0.00000"

Don&#8217;t have the patience? Shame on you, and TL;DR follows.Pogue says it&#8217;s no laptop replacement, but as a giant iPod touch, it&#8217;s a huge success. Mossberg says he enjoys doing most tasks on it much more than on his laptop, and considers it 80% a laptop replacement. Pogue hates the keyboard, Mossberg likes it. Both found the battery life to be exceptional &mdash; over the quoted 10 hours in both cases, which surprises me hugely. We talked about the iPad&#8217;s potential and competitors in today&#8217;s podcast, and the consensus was that, as both reviews stress, the flagship apps are the real indicator of the device class&#8217;s potential.PC Magazine and USA Today also weigh in, and are similarly positive. Among PC Mag&#8217;s cons is the fact that earbuds are not included. Really now. Xeni has one over at BoingBoing, and she likes it so much she shot pictures of it with a soft focus filter &mdash; my mistake, it&#8217;s probably just an iPhone camera.I notice there are few complaints about the lack of Flash support. That&#8217;s something that will emerge in time, I think &mdash; when a hundred thousand people start cruising the net and find that quite a few of their favorite sites have a few bits missing. Will they complain or merely shrug? We&#8217;ll soon find out.

It&#8217;s called the CrunchPad Kit and it goes on sale now. Best of all, we&#8217;re selling this for just $49 as an introductory price. Once 800 have sold, or about $44,000 in revenue, we&#8217;ll be moving to a higher price.The CrunchPad team has been working around the clock here at our Palo Alto headquarters to get the kit ready for full production in time for the delivery of the iPad on April 3.We know you want an iPad, but you aren&#8217;t as excited about that $499+ price tag. With the CrunchPad Kit, you can turn any laptop screen into a device that&#8217;s just as good, for a fraction of the price.Introducing The CrunchPad KitThe kit contains everything you need to convert any laptop screen into a fully functional touch screen device. The key piece of technology is a transparent resizable modular touch screen overlap material that you add to the screen after removing it from the rest of the laptop. You then install the remaining electronics, as well as a power supply, and the device is ready to go. Also included in each kit is a 4G module that you can optionally activate and add to the device for always-on connectivity.There&#8217;s real technology here, particularly in the touch module, that we&#8217;ve developed with our new partner. A number of patents have been filed around this new research, which we&#8217;re calling the F.U.J.J. With the F.U.J.J. you can convert any laptop screen of any size, up to 17 inches, into a CrunchPad.There&#8217;s more information in the video above, including a complete walk through of the five minute installation process. Order your CrunchPad Kit now, we expect to be completely sold out within 48 hours.Here&#8217;s one last picture of the Asian team we hired to help us build this product working on the F.U.J.J. from our office in Palo Alto after we sponsored their immigration visas to get them over here.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/introducing-the-do-it-yourself-crunchpad-kit-video/","2010-03-31","13","163","405","285","4.002500","5.617544","4264.00000","0.00000"

The site has seen a lot of changes since then.  It began as one of the original Web 2.0 personalized homepages, became a distributed widget platform, changed CEOs (when founder Tariq Krim stepped down in 2008 to start Jolicloud), then started appealing to enterprises, brands, and advertisers with intranet offerings and social media dashboards.I chatted with Mini today, who says that the company is profitable on a net income basis.  He won&#8217;t go into details on revenues, but the company has 40 employees and two offices.  Just to cover salaries, it&#8217;s got to be pulling in a few million dollars a year.  Mini did break down the revenues by product line, however:Netvibes for Enterprise: 50%Netvibes Premium Dashboards: 40%Widget Distribution: 10%The enterprise version, which accounts for half of the company&#8217;s revenues, lets employees customize their intranet homepage with a mixture of company and personal widgets.  Think iGoogle for businesses.  The dashboards are more for advertising and PR agencies, who can use them to push media on an opt-in basis to interested consumers.   Netvibes also recently launched a Dashboarding Guide, which is a &#8220;dashboard of dashboards,&#8221; says Mini.  It pulls together different monitoring and analytics tools (such as Google Trends, Compete, Yelp, Hootsuite, and Trendrr) all into one dashboard.The consumer-oriented homepage now has 3.5 million visitors a month, and Netvibes continues to improve that experience with its new realtime stream reader Wasabi, but that the paying customers are businesses.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/netvibes-profitability/","2010-03-31","0","2","273","198","4.625000","6.166667","0.00000","0.00000"
"44","Kleiner&#8217;s iFund Manager On Cracking The iPad&#8217;s Immersive Code","MG Siegler","5","7","Following Kleiner Perkins&#8217; iFund &#8220;Doubling Down&#8221; event today, I got the chance to speak with iFund managing partner Matt Murphy. Simply put, Murphy, who also managed the first iFund, thinks the opportunity with the iPad will be huge — potentially bigger than the first iFund. Obviously, Kleiner wouldn&#8217;t pump another $100 million into the fund if it didn&#8217;t believe that, but Murphy offered some insight into the firm&#8217;s thinking.While much of the focus has been on what the iPad will do as a consumer device, Murphy makes the case for how well it should work as a revenue-generating machine for the companies developing for it. He noted that of the 14 companies that are currently a part of the iFund (3 of which are in stealth mode), four of them are already profitable just two years after the fund&#8217;s launch. He attributes this to three main things: the freemium model, Apple&#8217;s payment structure, and micro-payments.One of those profitable companies is Shazam, the mobile music discovery service. The service noted today that it has seen over 15 million downloads on the iPhone (and iPod touch). Most of those are downloads of the free version of the app, but that free version has served as a gateway drug of sorts to get users hooked and eventually buying the premium version with more features. At $4.99, that paid version, Shazam Encore, is cheap enough that many users feel it is well worth the price.Perhaps more importantly, it&#8217;s so easy to download thanks to the App Store&#8217;s built-in payment structure. It&#8217;s one click, and the app is yours. And Murphy thinks we&#8217;re on the verge of an explosion in in-app payments thanks to that structure.One company, Booyah, which makes the popular location-based game MyTown (which we&#8217;ve covered quite a bit), is making good use of these in-app payments, Murphy notes. While the app is completely free, it allows users to buy upgrades within the game for small fees (ranging from $0.99 to $9.99). This is starting to take off, according to Murphy.He notes that while free apps on the Facebook platform convert users to paying customers at a 3% to 5% conversion rate, the iPhone is seeing that conversation in the 12% to 15% range. That&#8217;s a massive difference. And Murphy attributes it to the way payment ideas are presented in apps in combination with Apple&#8217;s easy payment structure that happens behind the scenes (the App Store tied to your credit card). When you see a new cheap feature in an app, &#8220;for $0.99 i&#8217;ll try that out,&#8221; Murphy notes. Those purchases are an afterthought.And the iPad will simply be an extension of all this, with the added potential benefit of even more in-app immersion. That&#8217;s what he sees as the iPad&#8217;s big benefit over the iPhone. &#8221;We want someone who cracks the code on a more immersive experience,&#8221; Murphy says.And it&#8217;s important to note that this new iFund isn&#8217;t iPad-only.  Before the end of this year, Murphy says there will be some 100 million devices running the iPhone OS (currently, there are around 75 million), Kleiner will continue to look at all types of companies doing both iPhone and iPad apps to invest this money into.So what is he particularly excited about with regard to the iPad? Murphy reiterated John Doerr&#8217;s excitement about potential healthcare uses for the iPad and notes that they&#8217;re looking at one company in particular now that could come into fruition relatively soon (he wouldn&#8217;t say what it was). He also says that education is a potentially huge market for this new device.When I asked about the buzz surrounding old school media companies coming to the iPad, Murphy said that he was reluctant about some of the companies being hired to work on these solutions because it&#8217;s not long-term defensible. That said, there is at least one pure content play in stealth mode that Kleiner has backed with the fund. It involves a well-known entrepreneur, but Murphy wouldn&#8217;t say anymore.I asked why, given the success of the first iFund, Kleiner was &#8220;only&#8221; going with another $100 million for the fund? Why not go higher? Murphy noted that it&#8217;s likely just a starting point. For example, the original $100 million funded companies have seen some $330 million more pumped into them from outside the fund (yes, this is a bit skewed by Zynga, which just raised a massive $180 million new round). Murphy notes that this second iFund could be gone in as little as 12 months. It all depends on the quality of the companies sprouting up around the iPad (and continuing to sprout around the iPhone).Finally, I asked Murphy about an area both him and I are excited about: location. Murphy notes that three of the 14 iFund companies, Pelago (the makers of Whrrl), Booyah, and Shopkick (makers of CauseWorld), are location-based at their core. He went on to note that all the companies in this space are doing exciting things with check-ins because it&#8217;s ultimately important data. &#8220;Foot-streams are more valuable than click-streams,&#8221; Murphy notes, taking a line from Whrrl&#8217;s playbook.But Murphy notes that each of these companies is still searching for the Holy Grail: highly targeted location-based advertising. Once you understand that someone goes to Starbucks at a certain time everyday, you start to understand their behavior, and then ads become really interesting, he notes.In terms of the iPad, Murphy wonders what uses people will come up with with regard to location. After all, it&#8217;s not a phone that you have in your pocket, and you probably won&#8217;t be taking it to dinner (unless you&#8217;re really rude). Again, he thinks a company like Booyah, with its heavy game element that will drive the immersion idea could come up with some cool things. But he feels there will be new types of apps that give you a different reason for why you check-in with the iPad.In general, even within Kleiner Perkins, the iPad seems to be the undiscovered country. And that&#8217;s breeding a lot of excitement. Among the partners, there is no doubt that it won&#8217;t be long before there&#8217;s the first huge app for it. But it&#8217;s hard to base that off of pitches without the device itself out there. &#8220;You won&#8217;t know it until you see it,&#8221; Murphy says.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/ifund-ipad/","2010-03-31","0","7","1068","725","3.873346","5.652414","0.00000","0.00000"

The primary use of this technology, say experts we&#8217;ve spoken with, is uranium enrichment.Enriched uranium is a necessary ingredient in the creation of nuclear energy, and one source we&#8217;ve spoken with at Google says that this is part of the Google Green Initiative. The company will use the new technology to enable it to design and possibly build small, mobile and highly efficient nuclear power generators. &#8220;Google has already begun building an enrichment plant,&#8221; says a high ranking IAEA source.As GreenBeat points out, &#8220;Google finally decided to launch a dedicated unit of the company for designing and building its own solar panels, wind turbines, energy efficiency devices, etc. So far, its green efforts have been pursued by separate projects within the company. Nuclear is an obvious next step for the company.&#8221;GreenBeat first broke the story (first titled Google Has A Big Alternate Energy Announcement Forthcoming) after seeing multiple tweets about the impending announcement.But other sources we&#8217;ve spoken with say Google has no real intention of pursuing nuclear energy, despite the fact that the company has promoted the use of alternate energy sources for years. Of particular concern is the fact that the company Google acquired is based outside of the U.S., and little is known about the new enrichment technology they&#8217;ve developed.Nuclear power generation is a highly regulated industry. And enriched uranium is a particularly sensitive topic and creation and distribution of the substance is highly controlled. Enriched uranium can also be used for nuclear weapons production, which is why the industry is so highly regulated.Says one source: &#8220;The story Google is putting out there is that the new technology will be built for clean energy production. But all of the research and development they&#8217;re doing in this area is being conducted outside of the U.S., and the enrichment facility is also outside of the U.S.&#8221;And more chillingly: &#8220;It would be trivial for anyone with this technology to build a nuclear weapon.&#8221;Google, which has been shaken by its inability to counter Chinese censorship and hacking efforts, may be engaging in enrichment research as part of a new effort to  simply protect itself from outside threats.One source pointed out that if Google were its own country, its revenues would place it at 74th on the list of countries sorted by gross domestic product. &#8220;The U.S. government clearly won&#8217;t protect Google from China, so Google is taking the logical step of protecting itself with a physical deterrent.&#8221;To be clear, most of this is speculation. All we&#8217;ve confirmed is that Google has acquired a company with a new enrichment process and that they have begun researching small, nuclear portable generators. But there is real evidence here that Google may be working on something much more sinister to counter the China threat. More as this develops.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/exclusive-google-to-go-nuclear/","2010-03-31","20","168","500","350","4.345455","6.145714","6760.00000","0.00000"

That is where experimental products can be found. There are separate Labs for Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Search, and YouTube (although sometimes they are called &#8220;experiments&#8221; or &#8220;TestTube&#8221;).  Now Google Ads has its own Labs, which it is calling Ad Innovations.  It is a central place where advertisers can &#8220;explore new marketing technologies.&#8221;Some of the highlighted technologies include Google&#8217;s new remarketing option, which shows ads to people who have visited the advertiser&#8217;s Website as they visit other sites that serve up Google ads.  Another feature highlighted on the Ad Innovations page is Google&#8217;s new Search Funnels analytics tool, which shows advertisers the history of interactions with their ads leading up to a click.  The online advertising industry is trying to prove to advertisers that even ads that don&#8217;t get clicked on can lead to conversions.  Search Funnels is Google&#8217;s way of making that argument.   The page also highlights product listing ads, special YouTube ads, and mobile click-to-call ads.It&#8217;s about time Google&#8217;s advertising products got their own Labs.  But hopefully ad products that don&#8217;t work won&#8217;t be allowed to linger around as long as some of the consumer stuff in Google Labs proper.

The aptly named page is the all-important portion of the site where you actually watch videos (it also features comments, ratings, and related videos).  At an event at YouTube headquarters this morning, three of the key people involved with the launch — Senior Product Manager Shiva Rajaraman, UI designer Julian Fumar, and engineer Igor Kofman — walked us through some of the changes in the new design, the logic behind them, and some of the early results they&#8217;ve seen.We first saw the new Watch page in January, when the site started allowing users to opt-in to it.  To test the new design, YouTube also rolled it out to around 10% of its users.  Among those users, YouTube says that it has see a rise in engagement  (which includes actions like ratings and leaving comments) by 7%, and an increase in the number of videos watched by 6%.  Those may not sound like huge numbers, but given that this is the world&#8217;s most popular video site, that translates into a lot of extra views.So what changed?  In short, everything is much cleaner.  The YouTube team said that in 2009 the site added more features than they had in the two previous years combined, and things were getting cluttered. So they&#8217;ve decided to prune the hedges.As we detailed when the redesign first become available,  the new site has streamlined the page header to place a much greater emphasis on search.  It has also abandoned YouTube&#8217;s long-standing five star rating system in favor of a binary thumbs up/thumbs down system (a change that YouTube has discussed for months).Less obvious changes: the &#8216;more info&#8217; button, which used to be a bizarrely small link nestled under the video description, is now positioned directly under the video, with a much larger clickable area.  The video uploader&#8217;s screenname is now more prominently featured above the video, as is the &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; button (there will be an opportunity for YouTube partners to brand this area). The related videos listing, which makes up the page&#8217;s right column, will now be more consistently positioned.  And you can now access the site&#8217;s detailed viewing statistics simply by clicking on the viewcount (these used to be tucked under a &#8217;stats&#8217; menu).CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/youtubes-new-streamlined-watch-page-boosts-engagement-by-7/","2010-03-31","1","14","402","279","4.051020","5.691756","30.00000","0.00000"
"48","Kleiner Perkins&#8217; Doubles Down The iFund To $200 Million For the iPad","MG Siegler","5","21","Today at the Rosewood Sandhill Hotel in Menlo Park, CA, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers hosted an event surrounding a &#8220;mobile content revolution.&#8221; The famous venture capital firm was tight-lipped about what this event would actually be about, but the speculation leading up to the event was that it may involve Apple&#8217;s new iPad, which is being launched in the U.S. on Saturday. Sure enough, it was.Kleiner Perkins today announced the doubling (or &#8220;doubling down&#8221; as partner John Doerr put it) of its iFund to $200 million. Initially, this includes more than a dozen iPad applications due in May from portfolio companies. In March of 2008 as Apple was unveiling its iPhone SDK, Kleiner Perkins unveiled the first iFund, a $100 million fund to spur iPhone app development.iFund portfolio companies at the event included Booyah, Cooliris, GOGII, InMobi, ngmoco, Pinger, Shazam, shopkick, and Zynga. In total, there are 14 ventures in the iFund now, 3 of which are in stealth mode. &#8220;They&#8217;re kicking ass,&#8221; Doerr notes.In fact, the iFund companies have produced apps that have seen 100 million total downloads, Doerr notes. And those companies are expected to pull in some $100 million in revenues this year. Four of the companies are already profitable, partner Matt Murphy notes. The problem is that with the success, the iFund is out of money — Kleiner Perkins actually raised an additional $330 million to pump into these companies outside of the initial iFund investment. And there&#8217;s this new device coming out&#8230;&#8220;On the eve of the iPad, the iFund is out of money,&#8221; Doerr said. Hence, the doubling of the fund.There are over 20 applications for the iPad currently in development under the iFund. 11 of those will launch on Saturday with the iPad itself. Doerr seems particularly excited about one of the stealth ones (which he wouldn&#8217;t talk about specifically) that rolling out in 5 weeks, that will be iPad-only.Below, find my live notes (paraphrased):John Doerr: Just 15 years ago in 1994 there was no Internet. There was no browser. Steve Jobs had left Apple he was working on Toy Story and NeXT. That year I saw Mosiac, the first web browser. It was magic. The rest of the 90s was a great experience. All those companies came around. Silicon Valley was a Florence of the&#8220;It feels like Deja Vu all over again. Twice in a lifetime.&#8221;A tsumani of cellphones have swept the world &#8211; now 3 billion have them. Including people in far reaches of Africa. There are 75 times more cellphones in Kenya than PCs. In 4 years there will be 32 million cell phones there. Everyone is going to have the Internet and a cell phone in their pockets.A few years ago Steve Jobs rocked the world with the iPhone. &#8221;If you can&#8217;t invent the future, the next best way is to fund it.&#8221;Think back to March 6, 2008, the iFund was a little risky. There was no iPhone 3G. We now have 14 ventures in the iFund, 3 are stealth. 8 of them are here today. They&#8217;re kicking ass.There are 100 million downloads, and there will be over $100 million in revenues from these companies this year. We&#8217;ve raised $330 million raised for them. But on the eve of the iPad, the iFund is out of money. To quote Bill Campbell, &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta have the fucking money.&#8221; So we&#8217;re doubling down the iFund to $200 million.This Saturday the iPad arrives, we believe it&#8217;s going to rule the world. I&#8217;ve held it, caressed it. It feels like you&#8217;re touching the future (Doerr stole that from me).We&#8217;re going into a brave new world. From the old world of Windows interfaces to touch. The swoosh of liquidity. The iPad is direct, it&#8217;s natural. WYTIWis &#8212; what you touch, is what is.Ron Okamoto, VP developer relations, Apple:Two year&#8217;s ago, John went out on a limb. Now it&#8217;s a tree. WIth the iPad, this is going to be big. We have 100,000 developers making over 150,000 apps that have been downloaded 3 billion times. That&#8217;s in just 24 months. With the iPad, it&#8217;s going to be even bigger.You&#8217;ve gotta have a cool name to be funded by Kleiner (laughs). We&#8217;ve seen what developers are working on so far, it&#8217;s fantastic. In a few days, you&#8217;ll see it too.Doerr back on stage100,000 flowers blooming. The tablet is where all these dreams are going to come true. This is going to start a third Renaissance in software. This will be a new interconnected, interactive world. This future will transform all fields (healthcare, etc). Over the next decade 3 times better battires in 10 times better powered chips. You&#8217;ll have a terabyte of local fast storage soon.I&#8217;ve always been awed by entrepreneurs. Let&#8217;s talk to the guys working in the iFund.Bing Gordon, Kleiner PerkinsI have no prepared remarks. Twas the night before iPad &#8211; nothing was stirring, except the whole family trying to throw away their mouse. I&#8217;m going to make a prediction. Many centuries ago the writing body language. 50 years ago, the typewriter body language. Then the iPhone body language. Now the iPad body language.Greg Woock, CEO PingerI&#8217;ve been with a lot of companies, nothing has been as successful as with the iPhone. We have paid apps and free apps. Many different business models &#8211; in app adds, in app purchases. We&#8217;ve done 13 titles, 10 have been in the top 100. Largely because we use our apps to sell other apps. If you&#8217;re not in the top 100 apps, it&#8217;s hard to be seen. We&#8217;re profitable &#8211; in a year, really in 9 months!So the iPad: The strongest thing I can saw is that my daughter immediately knew she wanted one. We&#8217;re making Doodle Buddy for the iPad. The most fun you can have with your hand (rather than your finger (with the iPhone).Keith Lee, BooyahWhen we saw the iPhone, we knew we had to leave our jobs at Blizzard. Camera, GPS, this was huge for new experiences. 4 months ago we launched MyTown. It&#8217;s the most popular location-based social game. It&#8217;s realworld Monopoly. We&#8217;ve been able to hit 1.6 million registered users. 130,000 new users a week. We&#8217;ve always been in the top 50 of the charts. People spending 70 million a day (per user) in our game. We have 4 million daily check-ins.Alex Musil, ShazamWe are in over 200 countries, we have 50 million users, we&#8217;re getting 750,000 new users added every week. There are 2 million tags a day. Over 15 million downloads on the iPhone. Had a top 50 ranking since we&#8217;ve been live in the App Store. And we&#8217;ll be on the iPad as well. It&#8217;s not just going to be a big iPhone app, it&#8217;s a new experience. You&#8217;ll see it on Saturday.Neil Young, ngmocoWe believed the iPhone could revolutionize mobile gaming, and the iFund backed us early. We&#8217;ve have over 30,000,000 downloads of our software. We&#8217;ve had 15 top 10 (total) apps. We Rule is huge now. We run the plus network, over 20,000,000 downloads of those games. Every single day users play over 20 million minutes of ngmoco games.The iPad will revolutionize gaming in the home. The iPad radically reshapes the way you interact with software. We&#8217;ll have 7 applications available at the launch of the iPad. All built specifically for the iPad. And yes, We Rule is coming to the iPad.Zack Norman, GOGIItextPlus is a next generation messaging platform. It blows up the relationship between the telephone and text messaging. 15 million messages a day. 2 billion messages since our launch. Our users are using 65 minutes a day on average. 5.5 million users.But the iPad will change everything &#8211; because it&#8217;s not a phone. It&#8217;s more like the iPod touch. The use cases have yet to be written and imagines. Text is a voice of a generation &#8211; other generations are coming with them. I think this new device will be huge for text messaging (again, without the phone part).Bing Gordon backZynga and Cooliris and Shopkick are also here to answer questions. We&#8217;ll do Q&amp;A in a minutes. Gordon reading a poem about the iPhone (yes, really).Q&amp;A TimeQ: How many companies in the iFund are profitable? Is the iPad a bigger opportunity than the iPhone?A (Matt Murphy from overseas): 4 companies right now are profitable, we&#8217;re not disclosing which ones. Cash-flow profitable for sure.The panel is split as to weather they&#8217;ll raise app prices for the iPad. Some will stay free, some won&#8217;t raise prices.A (Neil Young): It&#8217;s early days for the iPad, there are 75 million iPhone (and iPod touch) devices out there. The iPad will engage users for more time than the iPhone we think. I think living room gaming is going to have some competition from the iPad. Same with desktop gaming.A (Bing Gordon): I think the iPad market will be bigger than apps on the iPhone.Q: Could the iPad be bigger than the iPhone?A (John Doerr): I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know what apps are going to be built, but let me tell you about some I think about. I think every doctor and nurse will use an iPad. I don&#8217;t think we can anticipate the great new uses.Q: Is there a bigger business opportunity for tablet computing in general?A (Bing Gordon): The money from the iFund can be used for development on other platforms too.Q: What percent of revenue will be from iPhone or iPad?A (from the panel): It&#8217;s going to be most of it. The iTunes aspect is key, it&#8217;s a great infrastructure. Most of us are still a drop in the bucket in terms of how big we can grow. Apple has an incredible lead in the space right now. Calling the iPad a tablet is kind of like calling the iPhone a cellphone &#8212; it&#8217;s so much more.Q: 2 years from now what percent of usages is on the iPhone?A (Cooliris): We only have an app on the iPhoneA (Shopkick): Same with CauseWorld, majority is iPhone.A (Zynga): Big and growing.Q: What as the biggest surprise for developing on iPad?A (from the panel): The first iteration of the SDK was really complete, which was great. The iPad is not a big iPod touch &#8212; that misses the point. When you&#8217;re playing with it, you forget you&#8217;re using something. You no longer think about the interactions you&#8217;re doing, you just do. You have to touch it to understand. Mobile software is built around, when you got a second, you use it. But the iPad is more of a lean-back experience. It&#8217;s clearly not a bigger iPod touch. The device is magic. It will change the way normal human beings feel about computing.Q: So how long until the first non-iPhone killer apps?A: Insider 6 months I think you&#8217;ll see the first of those. If you wanted to build the killer app for the Xbox 360, it would take you two years. For the iPhone and iPad, it can happen so quickly.A (from Doerr): Within 5 weeks one of the stealth ventures is going to roll out an app that&#8217;s iPad-only. And quickly we&#8217;ll see education apps which will transform things.Q: What about Apple&#8217;s closed platform versus the Android open platform?A (Doerr): There are two different philosphies. The iPhone got there first, but each will make the other better. I don&#8217;t know which is going to win.Q: Is there something in stealth with healthcare?A: No comment.Q: Will there be many new ideas for healthcare?A: I can&#8217;t wait to see what we get.Gordon: So thank you for coming over. That&#8217;s a wrap.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/kleiner-perkins-ipad-fund/","2010-03-31","7","12","1991","1381","3.708841","5.285301","182.00000","0.00000"
"49","SharesPost Report Values Facebook At $9 Billion, Estimates 2010 Revenues At $1 Billion","Leena Rao","7","24","SharesPost, a private equity market that allows employees and founders to convert some of their shares into cash launched a publication platform to include reports that give greater insight into the valuations of companies like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. We examined  last year&#8217;s report, which estimated Facebook&#8217;s valuation between $4 to $6 million. Today&#8217;s report pegs Facebook&#8217;s valuation at around $9 billion, which is higher than last year&#8217;s number but lower than the $10 billion valuation the social network earned during its latest funding round last year. The report, which is you can access here, estimates Facebook&#8217;s current valuation between $8.4 and $9 billion after using two methods of analysis comparing revenues with steady-state enterprise valuation ($9 billion) and comparative enterprise valuation ($8.4 billion). The steady-state valuation estimates use a 25x market multiple and normalized net margins of 30%. Assuming that Facebook will make $2.5 billion in 2014, the report arrives at a target 2010 enterprise value of $9 billion. For the comparative valuation,  the report uses a secular growth rate of 25% and EBITDA margins of 50%, to arrive at a conservative valuation of $8.4 billion (assuming the company&#8217;s revenue to be $1.3 billion in 2011.)SharesPost&#8217;s report estimates that Facebook is currently burning through $200 &#8211; $300M of cash a year for its operational expenses and for capacity expansion, and is cash-flow positive, which we knew. The report highlights Facebook&#8217;s 400 million users and its dominance as the world&#8217;s largest social network, wide network of developers building off the platform, and the amount of ecommerce and advertising revenue flowing through the network. For example, Zynga spends between $5 million and $8 million per month on advertising on Facebook. The report estimates that Facebook&#8217;s revenue for 2010 will hit $1 billion and nearly $3 billion by 2015, another stat that we&#8217;ve heard before. 	SharesPost also released a report on the valuation of Twitter, estimating that the microblogging network is worth $750 million. Strangely, SharesPost&#8217;s recently-launched Venture-Backed Index has Facebook&#8217;s valuation listed at nearly $12 billion. We&#8217;ve contacted SharesPost for comment on this discrepancy.

There&#8217;s some chatter about it on Twitter as well, so this looks like it&#8217;s coming from a credible source.Apparently, publishers are being pushed to Chitika instead, which has set up this section on its website to &#8220;make the transition from Yahoo! Publisher Network as easy as possible&#8221;.Update: it&#8217;s legit, alright. Here&#8217;s the full email:Dear Publisher,Yahoo! continuously evaluates and prioritizes our products and services, in alignment with business goals and our continued commitment to deliver the best consumer and advertiser experiences. After conducting an extensive review of the Yahoo! Publisher Network beta program, we have decided to close the program effective April 30, 2010. We expect to deliver final publisher payments for the month ending April 30, 2010 to publishers no later than May 31, 2010. All publishers eligible for 1099s for the 2010 tax year will have those mailed by January 31, 2011.Because our content will no longer be delivered to your ad unit spaces after April 30, 2010, we recommend removing all YPN ad code from your pages by that date.For the opportunity to continue earning revenue, we suggest using Chitika, a leading advertising network that syndicates Yahoo!

If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact our Support Team at (866) 785-2636, Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PDT.Sincerely,Your Partners at Yahoo!The YPN blog remains silent about the axing, so far. We have e-mails in with both Chitika and Yahoo for more information.One thing I&#8217;m trying to figure out is why Yahoo doesn&#8217;t refer publishers to its search partner Microsoft instead, who operates adCenter.For background: the Yahoo! Publisher Network (aka YPN) was launched in August 2005 and has been labeled a beta product by Yahoo up until today. It provided registered publishers with cost-per-click contextual advertising as well as various tools and services to assist them in building and improving their websites.Chitika handily provided publishers with a FAQ page for more information about switching to them.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/yahoo-publisher-network-to-be-axed-customers-referred-to-chitika-instead/","2010-03-31","6","53","425","314","4.427536","5.837580","648.00000","0.00000"
"51","SharesPost Report Values Twitter At $750 Million","Erick Schonfeld","3","10","A new analyst report from private secondary market SharesPost values Twitter at around $750 million, which is less than the $1 billion valuation it got in its last round of funding and less than the $1.5 billion valuation private shares of Twitter are trading for on SharesPost itself.  The report notes that the $1 billion valuation was based on preferred shares, whereas it is looking at common shares.The analyst report, which you can access here, comes up with an enterprise value for Twitter based on projected revenues, margins, and comparisons to other companies.  Depending on the method, it comes up with a range of valuations from $656 million (by comparing Twitter&#8217;s estimated enterprise value to comparable companies) to $751 million (by estimating revenues, margins, and a discount rate).  It is all pretty much guesswork since Twitter still doesn&#8217;t know where the bulk of its revenues will come from. But the report makes a stab at projecting revenues of $45 million in 2010 going to $170 million in 2014.  It notes various sources of potential revenue in order of decreasing likelihood, starting with licensing its data feed to search engines (which is where most of its revenue is coming from today) and creating premium accounts for businesses (something else it has already dabbled in).  Other options for making money: charging third party apps based on how much API data they use, premium accounts for heavy individual users (limited potential), Web ads on user profiles, or ads in Tweets (these could alienate users).The best bet for Twitter to make money, says the report, is to continue to become a marketing channel for businesses and start charging for leads.  The opt-in model of people following businesses and brands should result in much higher sales per lead than other marketing channels such as email marketing, telemarketing, or bulk SMS marketing.  Businesses who use Twitter for social media marketing purposes tend to have many more followers than normal users and also Tweet more often.Another nice chart in the report show how Twitter&#8217;s uptime has improved since its early days (other than when it is under a denial of service attack), And the report confirms that most Twitter users are passive readers rather than active posters.  As I&#8217;ve long suspected, people on Twitter tend to consume more than they Tweet.  About 68 percent of users login at least once a month, but only 17 percent Tweet.  (Although, they do tend to start Tweeting more once they&#8217;ve been on the service for 9 months or longer).CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/sharespost-twitter-750-million/","2010-03-31","4","9","431","309","4.238208","5.815534","80.00000","0.00000"
"52","WePay&#8217;s Hassle-Free Group Payments Platform Launches To The Public","Leena Rao","7","27","WePay, a Y Combinator backed startup that aims to take the hassle out of group paying, is launching to the public today. As we wrote in our initial coverage  of the payments platform, WePay is an easy way to collect, manage and spend money for groups. WePay&#8217;s core architecture is based around a prepaid debit card system, which makes its accounts not only easy to set up but also more flexible when it comes to setting up group paying. So with PayPal, your account is tied to your name, without any way to separate the payments associated with a group. On WePay, you can create a unique, FDIC insured account for each group. While the account is still associated with your name, but you can keep each group account totally separate from your personal transactions. Group money can essentially be kept separate from any individual accounts you may have. You can also designate specific individuals to have control over accounts. From accounts on WePay, users can send emails with electronic bills (which can be paid with bank accounts or credit cards) and spend funds with a WePay VISA prepaid card, paper checks, or electronically. If group members don’t pay soon, the site will automatically remind them a few days later. WePay makes money by charging a 3.5% transaction fee (there’s also a different plan that charges 50 cents per transaction and limits you on the methods of payment you can accept). The site has been in private beta for the past six months but has received positive feed back from its limited number of users.Co-founder Bill Clerico likens PayPal to the payment equivalent of email (meaning its more targeted towards exchanging information or money between two separate parties) and WePay as the payment equivalent of Facebook, in that there is one central place for everyone to see the latest information, and payments are exchanged between many parties. As we wrote in December, all signs point to WePay being a winner, and viable competitor to PayPal in the group payments space. And a number of notable investors and technology executives seems to think so as well. In addition to funding from Y Combinator, the site has raised $1.65 million from August Capital and angel investors, including PayPal cofounder Max Levchin, PayPal alum Dave McClure, FriendFeed co-founder Paul Buchheit, Ron Conway, Mark Goines, Andrew McCollum, Joe Campanelli, and Angus Davis.

"53","Less Than One Third Of Tweets Come From The United States, Study Says","Robin Wauters","11","14","Paris-based Semiocast, which helps brands understand and interact with real-time Web services, has again done a study on Twitter usage. After finding that only 50% of tweets are in English, based on an analysis of 2.8 million tweets, the company has now looked at nearly five times as many Twitter messages in order to gain more insight on the increased international presence of the popular micro-sharing service.According to an analysis of 13.5 million tweets published over the course of one week, Semiocast concluded that users located in the United States account for only thirty percent of all tweets. The next English-speaking country on the list comes in fifth, with only 6 percent of tweets analyzed originating from the United Kingdom.Top countries are the U.S., Japan, Brazil, Indonesia and the UK, in that order.Semiocast says only 0.5% of tweets appear to come geo-tagged. In order to establish the share of countries more accurately, the company also processed tweets and self-declared locations in bios from users with the help of its multi-lingual semantic technology platform, effectively parsing the locations of Twitter users as good as possible.Semiocast says the strongest growth rate was not registered in the United States, where Twitter is headquartered, but in other regions around the world. Furthermore, English now accounts for less than 44% of tweets, down from 50% merely six weeks ago.Japan, where Twitter has been actively bolstering its presence for the past two years now, is the second largest tweeting nation, accounting for about 15% of messages worldwide. The third largest Twitter nation is Brazil, with nearly 12% of messages worldwide, which translates to about 6.2 million messages per day. Indonesia, where Twitter is big thanks to partnerships with local carriers, ranks fourth with 10% of messages worldwide or about 5 million messages on a daily basis.Overall, the sample of tweets analyzed is fairly small, considering that today, an estimated 53 million tweets are published on a daily basis, up from 50 million per day in February 2010. Nevertheless, other companies who&#8217;ve analyzed the internationalization of Twitter in the past have come to similar conclusions: the growth rate of tweets is clearly accelerating outside the United States, and the share of Twitter messages originating from the company&#8217;s home country is getting smaller every day. Even Twitter investor Fred Wilson has written about that trend on his blog last weekend.For more context, Sysomos has published research findings on this topic before. In January 2010, the company looked at 13 million active Twitter accounts from mid-October to mid-December 2009 and found that 50.8% of Twitter activity came from the U.S., followed by Brazil (8.79%), the U.K. (7.2%), Canada (4.35%) and Germany (2.49%). Japan was 10th at 1.22%. That was a sharp drop compared to the 62.1% share in the United Stated Sysomos registered in June 2009.How long until Japan, Indonesia or Brazil takes the lead at the expense of the United States?CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/twitter-internationalization/","2010-03-31","2","11","506","342","4.251521","6.128655","48.00000","0.00000"

"56","Placecast Launches Match API To Ensure Accuracy In Location-Based Check-Ins","Leena Rao","7","7","Following the location-based frenzy that took place at this year&#8217;s SXSW festival, my colleague MG Siegler highlighted a definitive issue when it comes to checking in on various social networks like FourSquare, Gowalla, Loopt and others. The problem is that each of these check-in services has their own places database, which means that a place on Foursquare may be slightly different than a place on Gowalla, even though they’re technically the same place. Moreover, within many location-based social networks, there are duplicates for some venues since people are allowed to create their own. Location-based advertising and marketing service Placecast is hoping to resolve this problem by launching its Match API, Rosetta Stone like-database for location venue data. Placecast&#8217;s free Match API will enables location content providers and location-based application developers to refer to a location in any number of ways, and validate that those references resolve to one true location for each check-in. In more simple terms, the API will take duplicate listings for a venue and combine them into one listing. The API translates data across services and matches it for accuracy, regardless of the ID system. And because the Placecast Match API is an open system, Placecast’s Match API enables companies working with location data to use any (or multiple) ID system and resolve to one true location. For example, if I check-in to  the lobby of the Hilton Hotel and a friend checks into the restaurant at the Hilton Hotel, the Match API would resolve these and show both as the same location and check-in venue.

"57","Munster: Apple will build a search engine","John Biggs","4","39","Ha! Hold on. Let me walk around a little, calm down. Ummm&#8230; so Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray, the guy who was right about the iPad because he wouldn&#8217;t shut up about it for most of the last five years, is saying there&#8217;s a &#8220;70% chance&#8221; that Apple will build a search engine. Barring thought that Apple needs to run a search engine like a fish needs to run a bicycle factory, let&#8217;s look at what he&#8217;s saying (via BusinessInsider)We believe Apple could utilize data unavailable to Google, data generated by the company&#8217;s App Store, to create a mobile centric search engine, which would be a unique offering to Google&#8217;s search engine.An iPhone specific search engine could be a difficult undertaking, but we feel Apple could make a minor acquisition of a search company that has built a web index, like a Cuil, and utilize the index as the base for building its own engine.We believe the odds of Apple developing a search engine in the next five years are 70%. One hurdle for Apple in developing its own search engine would be generating enough advertiser interest to form a competitive marketplace; however, we believe the rationale for an Apple search product is to protect data rather than generate profit.While I rarely enjoy point-by-point takedowns, I&#8217;m feeling rather frisky on this one. Let&#8217;s begin:1. We believe Apple could utilize data unavailable to Google, data generated by the company&#8217;s App Store, to create a mobile centric search engine. &#8211; So this would search for popular Apps? Is that a &#8220;search engine&#8221; or a Genius system for apps. I suspect the latter. Maybe Gene didn&#8217;t get the the right term when he checked his Webster&#8217;s Dictionary of Computer Terms he bought in college.2. we feel Apple could make a minor acquisition of a search company that has built a web index, like a Cuil &#8211; Remember Cuil? Well no one else does. Apparently someone mentioned Cuil at Munster&#8217;s bridge club tournament after reading about it an an old 2008 issue of Fast Company they found in the dentist&#8217;s office and it stuck. Someone could have said AltaVista and the same thing could have happened.3. One hurdle for Apple in developing its own search engine would be generating enough advertiser interest &#8211; Because who wouldn&#8217;t want to work arm-in-arm a distant, far-from-mainstream search contender dedicated to sifting the ether for data on Hot Tub Time Machine soundboards?4. we believe the rationale for an Apple search product is to protect data rather than generate profit. &#8211; Now this one is rich. Apparently Smith &#038; Wollensky had two-for-one martini night and Munster&#8217;s dining partner &#8211; the one who probably planted this seed in the first place &#8211; apparently partook. &#8220;Protect data rather than generate profit&#8221; sounds exactly like something Apple would do. After all, they&#8217;re in the business of making things better for all of us. If you haven&#8217;t visited the Apple Health Centers where they can cure future brain embolisms by bathing you in purple light, you&#8217;re missing out. Just don&#8217;t take their flu vaccine.I hate to single anyone out &#8211; we all make crazy proclamations, especially when we&#8217;re hopped up on Skittles and chocolate milk (not naming names) &#8211; but WTF?

"58","Memeo Is Bringing A Google Docs Reader To The iPad","Jason Kincaid","1","15","This Saturday, Apple will be releasing the iPad to the masses, and you can be sure that one of the first things people will do when they get their hands on the device is explore what awaits them on the App Store.   For anyone who regularly uses Google Docs in the workplace, one of the most appealing apps is likely going to be Memeo&#8217;s Connect Reader, which will allow users to download and natively view all of their Google Docs files on their iPads.  We got a sneak peek at the free application, which will launch the same day as the iPad.The application allows users of any Google Docs account (be it normal or Premiere) to automatically download and store their Docs, which they can then view using the iPad&#8217;s document viewer that&#8217;s been integrated into Memeo&#8217;s app.  The viewer supports a range of popular formats, including Office, Apple&#8217;s iWork formats, and docs created in Google&#8217;s online editor (which are downloaded as HTML to preserve formatting).So why is this important?  First, given the current battle waging between Apple and Google, it&#8217;s unlikely that Apple would even approve a Google-made Docs app at all.  But Google Docs is popular enough that it would be unwise for Apple to ban the service from the iPad entirely — users would just make the jump to the upcoming Google tablets.  Memeo thinks that it and other independent third parties are well positioned in the current situation, as they&#8217;ll be able to provide services to bridge this gap.  It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that Steve Jobs allegedly sent an email stating that the iPad would support importing Google Docs to the iPad through iWork or iDisk.We last wrote about Memeo in January, when Google started allowing users to upload any type of file to Google Docs, effectively allowing them to use it for online storage.  Memeo was one of Google&#8217;s preferred partners for the launch, and their desktop sync software has already been adopted by 40% of Google&#8217;s enterprise customers (defined as companies with 1000+ seats).

Newspaper, magazine and online publishers who already use Delve to deliver video on the iPhone or iPod touch (the company also helps publishers reach audiences on Android and Blackberry phones) will automatically be able to deliver video to the iPad without further changes.Their videos will automatically be encoded in the right format to be viewed through iPad&#8217;s player if the publisher inserts some lines of code on its website. Delve&#8217;s detection system will then decide the appropriate link to present to the viewer depending on which device he or she is using. Delve does not not require browsers to support HTML5, although the company says it considers HTML5 support to be a key component of its product roadmap.Delve Networks clients include Lego, NFL, Pokemon, the Department of Defense, Skateboard.TV and more.MeFeedia this morning touted its ability for advertising on HTML5 videos, thanks to its All Player technology, which it says is patent-pending.

DeGeneres&#8217;s family supposedly left Canada in the late 1700s when her 5th great-grandfather Joseph Martin relocated to Louisiana. It wasn&#8217;t until the late 1870s that Madonna&#8217;s 2nd great-grandmother Emilie Daniel left Quebec and moved to Michigan, where the singer herself calls home.If true (or maybe regardless thereof), this is a publicity boon for Ancestry.com, which went public in November and currently boasts a $721 million market cap. No doubt, it will make a lot of people who pick up on the claimed family ties between the two entertainment giants wonder what the site is all about and give it a try themselves.Sadly, the company is pushing it a bit too far by quoting genealogist Anastasia Tyler as follows:&#8220;It&#8217;s not every day you discover two celebrity icons are related, but it&#8217;s their similarities that make the connection so extraordinary. They were born the same year, have both written books and been on tour, are known for their impressive dance moves – and with Ellen&#8217;s latest gig on American Idol – are both legendary figures on the music scene.&#8221;Meh. Would have been better to simply stick to the facts, people.This isn&#8217;t exactly the first time Ancestry.com have uncovered family connections between celebrities: in 2009, they connected financier Warren Buffett to President Barack Obama.Are you related to anyone famous?

"65","doubleTwist Gives Android Market The Slick, iTunes-Like Interface It Deserves (With One Catch)","Jason Kincaid","1","34","Android Market is finally getting a robust desktop presence.  But we don&#8217;t have to Google to thank for it — it&#8217;s coming from doubleTwist, the syncing software that allows you to sync your media with Android phones (it also supports myriad other devices).  The new feature is launching today with the latest update of doubleTwist for Mac, and will be included with the Windows version soon.  doubleTwist is also offering a web version of its Android Market directory, which you can access at http://apps.doubletwist.com.I&#8217;ve made no secret of my dislike for the current version of Google&#8217;s official web presence for Android Market — it offers a sampling of Android&#8217;s top apps, but it&#8217;s ugly and doesn&#8217;t offer a full listing of what&#8217;s available (it doesn&#8217;t even offer a search function).  There are some third-party web directories, like AndroidLib, but these don&#8217;t offer the slick feel you get from a desktop application.  doubleTwist comes closer than either of these options to matching the iTunes browsing experience, but it still isn&#8217;t perfect.The Android Market integration looks quite nice. Clicking the menu item in the left sidebar brings up a list of the top featured, paid, and free applications on Android Market.  And, unlike Google&#8217;s official Market site, you can actually search using doubleTwist&#8217;s version.  Clicking on an app will bring up its description, screen shots, and reviews — it looks a lot like the iTunes App Store interface, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing.However, doubleTwist&#8217;s Market integration comes with a couple of issues.  First, it doesn&#8217;t include any application categories, like &#8216;Games&#8217; or &#8216;Communication&#8217; (though this seems like it would be a fairly minor addition).  The other issue is more problematic: you can&#8217;t actually use doubleTwist to download and sync applications to your Android device.  Instead, each entry on the Market features a QR code that you have to scan from your phone to bring up the appropriate item in Android Market.doubleTwist co-founder Monique Farantzos says that the company plans to offer Over The Air downloads this summer (which would let you send apps to your device without having to bother with this QR code nonsense), and that the company has also approached Google about a way to make the experience more integrated and seamless. Still, even without OTA downloads, the Market integration looks slick.Alongside today&#8217;s update, doubleTwist is also releasing a web version of its podcast directory, which launched earlier this month (you can see a screenshot of the search directory below).CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/doubletwist-itunes-for-android/","2010-03-31","3","28","427","309","4.566586","6.103560","174.00000","0.00000"

The WSJ report has manufacturing on the CDMA iPhone ramping up in September, but also notes that the phones may not be available to consumers immediately. This means at the earliest, we&#8217;re looking at a Fall release, or possibly even a holiday release for the device (if not later depending on several factors). That means that AT&amp;T would still get the supposed &#8220;iPhone HD&#8221; all to itself for several months at least.Then you&#8217;d have to wonder if Apple would dare announce that it would be bringing the iPhone to other carriers &#8220;later this year&#8221; at its WWDC event (where it traditionally launches the new iPhone hardware)? If they did that, they risk people sitting out for several months, waiting for the Verizon version to hit before buying an iPhone. They&#8217;d be putting customers in a tight spot: do you upgrade to the sleek new hardware now, locking yourself into a new 2-year contract with AT&amp;T? Or do you wait? If Apple in in fact planning a CDMA version of the iPhone, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they don&#8217;t say anything about it at WWDC.Apple is also giving AT&amp;T a nice little present in the form of the iPad. While the version hitting stores this Saturday will not have 3G connectivity, the one coming at the end of April will. And yes, it will be exclusively provided by AT&amp;T. There was some speculation leading up to the iPad launch that it may launch with Verizon connectivity, but the chances of Apple building a second CDMA version of the iPad anytime soon seem pretty slim at this point. Especially with AT&amp;T giving them an unheard deal for customers: $15 for 250MB-a-month of data usage and $30 for unlimited data. As anyone with a 3G card will tell you, this is basically half-off of the normal data rates the carriers charge.Apple is not stupid. They hear all of us bitching about AT&amp;T&#8217;s sub-par service, and word is that they&#8217;re not too happy about it either. But the fact of the matter is that because of the exclusive agreement, AT&amp;T is paying them a ridiculous fee for each iPhone solid — something to the tune of $600 a phone. At the end of the day, that equals billions of dollars in revenues for Apple. If Apple were to branch out to other carriers, this deal would likely have to be renegotiated because Verizon has some leverage as the nation&#8217;s largest carrier and probably won&#8217;t give Apple the same kind of deal.So despite all of our bitching, Apple is only likely to move beyond exclusivity if it makes sense for the bottom line. That is, if Apple feels like the iPhone can&#8217;t grow any further in the U.S. under one carrier, they will extend it to others. Or, if Apple feels that Android is gaining too much momentum because it&#8217;s on several carriers, they will extend it to others. The latter appears to be starting to happen, while the former is still unclear. At one point, it was believed that Apple would wait out going to multiple carriers in the U.S. until the 4G networks (which will be a much more unified technology) were ready. But as the WSJ article states, delays in that process may have forced them to change their minds.So perhaps Apple is dangling the iPad and early access to the iPhone HD as signs of good faith towards AT&amp;T. Maybe they want the carrier to know that even though the time of exclusivity is coming to an end, they intend to give them certain perks in exchange for keeping the same terms of their current deal.Imagine for a second that the iPhone is available on AT&amp;T and Verizon — but AT&amp;T gets access to the new hardware several months before Verizon. You might think most people would wait to buy the new iPhone, believing Verizon is the better network. But going forward, once Apple initially offloads a few million customers over to Verizon (which I don&#8217;t think is an unreasonable number for how many current iPhone owners would switch if given the option), some of AT&amp;T&#8217;s horrific networks problems (which are related the the network being under too much strain) may be miraculously solved.It seems like a win-win for everybody. Or at least Apple will paint it that way. And, as usual, they will be the real winner in the end.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/iphone-hd-ipad-apple-att-verizon/","2010-03-31","0","48","876","578","3.682135","5.491349","0.00000","0.00000"
"67","Peixe Urbano: Brazil Gets A Groupon-Like Deal Site","Jason Kincaid","1","8","Over the last few months we&#8217;ve seen quite a few international startups that are looking to capitalize on the success of Groupon, the deal-a-day startup that has been getting quite a bit of buzz lately. Europe has already seen many similar sites, and tonight, Brazil is getting its due: Peixe Urbano (which means &#8220;Urban Fish&#8221; in Portuguese) has just launched to the public, offering daily deals to Brazil&#8217;s nearly 70 million Internet users.Founder Julio Vasconcellos concedes that Peixe Urbano has many similarities to Groupon — it sends users one great deal per day (generally offering 50-90% off) via Email, Twitter, or Facebook.  And, like Groupon, a certain number of people have to sign up for the deal before it &#8220;activates&#8221;, which gives users an incentive to tell their friends.  But Vasconcellos says that he and co-founder Alex Tabor have made some key changes to better adapt the new site to Brazilian culture.While both founders are from Brazil, they decided to do some market research to get a more accurate measure of how they should diverge from Groupon&#8217;s model. Their conclusions: first, Vasconcellos says that Brazilians tend to favor spontaneous activities as opposed to discounts or gift cards with a six month expiration, so Peixe Urbano will include more time-sensitive deals, like cheap tickets for next-day shows or happy hour at the local restaurant. Second, Vasconcellos says that Brazilians tend to be less excited about sharing coupons and sales with their friends (they may be frowned upon socially), so Peixe Urbano is positioning itself as a site to discover cool hidden gems in your city, with the added bonus of saving some money in the process.Other international Groupon-like we&#8217;ve covered include Snippa(UK), Daily Deal(Germany), and CityDeal(Germany).  And there are plenty more — the UK alone has at least a half dozen Groupon clones.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/peixe-urbano-brazil-gets-a-groupon-like-deal-site/","2010-03-30","0","7","308","230","4.630000","6.039130","0.00000","0.00000"
"68","Orange, OpenX team up to establish pan-European ad exchange ecosystem","Robin Wauters","11","4","France Telecom / Orange is partnering with OpenX to launch Orange Ad Market, a brand new online advertising marketplace tailored to the European digital industry.Orange Ad Market will be operated by Orange and powered by OpenX in exchange for a share on every transaction that is made through the platform. The marketplace will allow all classes of buyers to compete for targeted impressions in real-time auctions and help sellers of online display advertising inventory from all over the globe maximize revenue. The partnership between Orange and OpenX spans multiple years and is mutually exclusive to all regions Orange operates in. Here&#8217;s how it will work:On the sell side, publishers make inventory available to Orange Ad Market. They set the minimum price on said inventory, which is basically the minimum they are willing to sell the ad space for, and they get to set filters on ad types and content. On the purchase side, ad buyers create campaigns targeting the inventory they desire. They can specify a variety of bid rules, including geo-targeting, category targeting, retargeting, brand safe restrictions, frequency capping, and more. They also specify the bid they wish to make for the desired inventory. Buyers can also use real-time bidding technology to bid at the instant the ad request comes into the Ad Market. As each ad request is made, Orange Ad Market holds an auction in real-time for that particular ad, with the impression going to the winning bidder if &#8211; and only if &#8211; it beats the minimum price set by the publisher.Initially, Orange Ad Market will be launched in the United Kingdom and France (expect its debut in the second quarter of 2010), with planned launches in other regions throughout Europe at an undefined later stage.The partnership is significant because Orange, unbeknownst to some, operates Europe&#8217;s largest advertising network: the Orange Ad Network is good for a global reach of approximately 343 million unique users per month, spread across no less than 33 countries. In the pilot countries for Orange Ad Market &#8211; the UK and France &#8211; alone, the network reaches some 75 million unique users on a monthly basis, according to Vincent Pelillo, Director of Orange Advertising Network.Basically, this means the France Telecom Group company can build upon a lot of existing relationships with both publishers and advertisers, and make a serious attempt at establishing a genuine pan-European ad exchange ecosystem.OpenX, which will deliver the technology platform and second-tier support for the venture, will collect a 20% fee on all transactions. OpenX&#8217;s CEO, former Yahoo exec Tim Cadogan, tells me this is the standard share it charges for transactions on its own OpenX Market, which he claims reaches more than quarter of a billion unique users per month, as well. Cadogan added that the company&#8217;s is actively looking to strike similar deals with carriers and other potential partners in the Americas and Asia.CrunchBase Information","http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/orange-openx-team-up-to-establish-pan-european-ad-exchange-ecosystem","2010-03-31","1","0","497","349","4.387967","6.060172","2.00000","0.00000"
"69","RjDj Now Lets You Create Your Own Trippy, Reactive Music For iPhone And iPad","Jason Kincaid","1","13","Back in fall 2008, when the App Store was less than 100 days old, I wrote about an incredibly trippy and innovative application called RjDj (iTunes link). The app is a bit hard to describe, but it essentially takes audio or motion input from your iPhone, passes it through a variety of filters, and outputs music that&#8217;s customized to your surroundings (you really need to try it for yourself to see what it&#8217;s like).  Now, RjDj is taking its application to the next level: the company has released a new desktop app called RJC1000 that allows Mac users to easily build their own reactive music for use on any of RjDj&#8217;s growing roster of applications.To take a step back, when you use RjDj, you listen to what&#8217;s called a &#8220;Scene&#8221; — a combination of filters that determine what your reactive music sounds like. A Scene can pay attention to your iPhone&#8217;s microphone, accelerometer (so it can &#8216;hear&#8217; motion), and even your GPS position.  It then interprets those inputs to generate a dynamic music soundtrack.  Scenes can vary a lot, ranging from pleasant rain drops to psychedelic audio warping that loops back everything you hear endlessly. With the RJC1000 app, you can customize Scenes to make them sound exactly like you want them to.  You can get a feel for how this works in the YouTube video below.I explored the RJC1000 app to try building my own sound Scene, and quickly came to the conclusion that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Fortunately that didn&#8217;t really matter — after dragging a few effects from the list of options onto the main sound board, I found myself listening to something best described as an auditory mix of running water, crickets, bongo drums, and a swarm of butterflies. I&#8217;m sure someone with more patience and skill could come up with something significantly more pleasant.Alongside the new application, RjDj is launching the RjDj Network, which allows reactive musicians (this genre is called &#8220;reactive music&#8221;) to sell their creations to anyone using the RjDj iPhone application, via in-app purchases.  RjDj is taking a 50% rev share of any Scenes sold. The company will also be launching an iPad application on April 3 called RJ Voyager that allows for playback of any Scenes from the RjDj Network, and also let users tweak Scenes on the fly, editing the effects they want playing as their music is generated in real-time.RjDj founder Michael Breidenbruecker says that developers and musicians have previously been able to create their own Scenes using Pure Data, but that most of them found it too abstract to use (the screenshots I looked at were pretty daunting). The RJC1000 application uses the Pure Data DSP framework, but makes it significantly easier to build a Scene.  He says that beyond the iPad app, RjDj has other applications in the works that will support Scenes from the RjDj network.

All the initial hair-pulling and angst surrounding Apple&#8217;s decision to not support Flash on the iPad is already mattering less and less.  At least for video, most of the major online video platforms such as Brightcove and Ooyala are supporting HTML5 playback in the iPad browser.  YouTube might eventually get there as well.Now Kyte is jumping on the HTML5 bandwagon.  Kyte videos will stream in an HTML5 player in the iPad browser using the same embed code that triggers a Flash player on other computers.  But Kyte is also going to release a software developer kit (SDK) in the next couple weeks which will let its media partners create apps specifically for the iPad.  The SDK will also let them create versions of the same apps for the iPhone and the iPod Touch.  This will replace the iPhone framework Kyte released last year.The SDK will customize apps for the larger screen of the iPad, allowing for a larger video player and more room for chat and show guides.  In the mockup above from Om Records, you can see how there is more room for the various elements of the app on the iPad.Kyte&#8217;s main customers are media brands, music bands, and brands such as ABC, Fox News, MTV, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, and Calvin Klein who want to publish videos to their Websites and mobile apps all from the same system.  Kyte&#8217;s new Apple &#8220;universal&#8221; SDK will allow developers to create apps for both the iPhone and the iPad, and send out the correct version depending in the user&#8217;s device.

"71","Tomorrow, SimpleGeo Launches Into Location Orbit With 5,000 Partners In Tow","MG Siegler","5","18","If you&#8217;ll pardon the pun, SimpleGeo has positioned itself well.With a frenzy of activity surrounding location-based services, more and more startups are launching ideas that rely heavily on location. But implementing location is still a relatively complicated process. And that&#8217;s where SimpleGeo comes in.We&#8217;ve written about the service a number of times over the past several months. Basically, they provide the infrastructure and tools to allow other services to add location elements with ease. In fact, since they launched in beta late last year, they already have some 5,000 developers on board using their service. And tomorrow at the Where 2.0 conference in San Jose, CA, they&#8217;re opening up their platform for all to use.Alongside the launch, SimpleGeo is introducing two new products: the SimpleGeo Marketplace and the SimpleGeo Storage Engine. The Marketplace will make it easy for developers to see a range of different geodata and pick what they want to use. This store allows developers to get in touch with the geodata providers who are serving up the data (names you know like Twitter, Foursquare, Gowalla, etc).The Storage Engine is a cloud-based system to allow developers to store location and do queries on it. Think of it as Amazon S3 for geodata.So how much does it cost to use SimpleGeo? It&#8217;s free for up to a million calls, after that it&#8217;s $399 for 2 million calls (and additional support), $2,499 for 10 million calls, and $9,999 for 30 million calls. The pricing model is based on how much you&#8217;d need to pay for an engineer to handle that much data. Seeing as SimpleGeo curates this data and provides the servers needed for it, it will be a big value to most companies.DeCarta, ESRI, Localeze, MetaCarta, Quova, Stamen Design, and Weather Decision Technologies are a few of the big partnerships SimpleGeo recently signed. There was also a Skyhook Wireless deal that went live during SXSW. And you&#8217;ve probably heard of some of the startups already using SimpleGeo, such as StickyBits and BumpRadar.Since its $1.5 million seed funding in November, SimpleGeo has been hiring like crazy and hopes to open a San Francisco branch soon (they&#8217;re currently based in Boulder, CO).And despite the launch, SimpleGeo&#8217;s work is far from done. The plan is to launch a couple new features in relative short order, co-founder Matt Galligan tells us. One is called &#8220;Pushpin&#8221; which will let developers send in a coordinate and get back all sorts of data from SimpleGeo such as country, state, city, neighborhood, zip code, etc. And using other data, you could get the names of buildings on college campuses, for example, Galligan says.Another new feature called &#8220;Polygon&#8221; will let developers send in the name of an area such as &#8220;The Mission&#8221; in San Francisco, and SimpleGeo will return a list of everything in that area.Look for SimpleGeo&#8217;s new website and new admin interface to launch tomorrow after Galligan takes at Where 2.0 around noon PT. You&#8217;ll be able to sign up to get in on the location action at that time. Then you can go build your own version of this.[photo: flickr/bruce tuten]CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/simplegeo-launch/","2010-03-30","3","16","540","378","4.088847","5.722222","68.00000","0.00000"

WordPress.com backs up all of the blogs that it hosts, but those users who self-host their WordPress-powered blogs need to download outside plugins, such as this one, or use backup services like Mozy or Backupify to protect their data and content. Today Automattic is changing that with the launch of its own blog protection and restoration service for self-hosted blogs, called VaultPress. Currently in private beta, VaultPress is a plugin users can download that acts as a backup service for your blog. Not only will the software help keep your blog up and running, but it will also soon monitor your site to alert you if their is suspicious activity or a hacking. Alternatively, VaultPress will eventually update your blog with security hot-fixes automatically. VaultPress will be a paid service and will probably be in the ballpark range of $15 to 20 per month, according to Automattic VP of User Growth Paul Kim. At first VaultPress will be extended on an invitation only basis and will eventually be open to the public in the near future. While users can still use outside services or WordPress community plugins, VaultPress will be the only WordPress.com branded offering. And the plugin is tightly woven into WordPress.com infrastructure, promising greater operability, says Kim. Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg  says VaultPress is one of the most advanced technologies that he&#8217;s seen interact with WordPress. The vision of the service is to ensure that every piece of content on WordPress-powered blogs and sites are safe, with WordPress-aware, real-time, multi-cloud backups. VaultPress as a product makes sense for WordPress.com and frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that the blogging platform didn&#8217;t roll this out earlier.

At a time when Flash is under fire from both Apple and HTML5 advocates, this is a huge win for the technology. But one thing that wasn&#8217;t clear from Google&#8217;s post on the matter (and Adobe&#8217;s comment to us) is what this means for the upcoming Chrome OS. So I asked.&#8220;We plan to bring these benefits to Chrome users across all platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Google Chrome OS,&#8221; a Google spokesperson tells me. In other words, yes, this deep Flash is coming to Chrome OS.Here&#8217;s why this is significant: when Chrome OS-based netbooks launch later this year they will not only compete with Windows-based netbooks, they will also compete with the iPad. The iPad, of course, will not run Flash. This could be a major differentiating factor when people are deciding which machine to buy this holiday season. Especially if those people are addicted to Farmville (which is, of course, Flash-based).“Netbooks aren’t better at anything,&#8221; Apple CEO Steve Jobs said while unveiling the iPad back in January.

I don&#8217;t want to draw a parallel between used car sales and the mobile ad marketplace, but it&#8217;s an industry, like many, that could use more transparency. Burstly, an ad manager service, wants to do just that.The company, a reincarnation of .App/Ads,  just raised $1.8 million in series A funding from GRP Partners (Mark Suster is a partner) and Rincon Ventures. That values the start-up in the eight-figure range, according to CEO and founder Evan Rifkin. Burstly emerges from closed beta today and offers a full service, open platform (an open SDK structure) to help iPod touch and iPhone app developers optimize their advertising revenue streams,  use a variety of ad networks or exchanges, directly sell or buy ads from other developers, run in-app purchases, rotate different content into ad slots and more.  In addition, Burstly can support any ad size on the iPad and video interstitials.As of now everything is free except for the Burstly marketplace, where developers can buy or sell ad space with the community on a pay per install basis&#8212; all prices are transparent and Burstly collects a uniform 10% cut from each transaction. They&#8217;re so confident in the business model, that Burstly will give developers a no risk guarantee: the publisher submits a floor eCPM and Burstly will run impressions and try to beat that&#8212; if they can&#8217;t do that they&#8217;ll pay double the difference at the end of each month.The key to the company&#8217;s future profitability is of course volume. Rifkin knows that a 10% margin is pretty thin, but he&#8217;s hoping that the suite of services, simple interface, and clear economics will attract enough users to put the company in the black. With just 100 private beta users on the site (including Inedible Software, Boy Genius Report), he acknowledges that it may take 1.5 to 2 years. In fact, the company knows it may lose some money from its money back guarantee.  Clearly, profits will require patience, but Burstly is well situated to be an important player in mobile advertising out of the gate&#8212; especially for small developers.Burstly is trying to set itself apart from competitors like AdMob and Quattro (both of which were recently acquired by giants&#8212; Google and Apple respectively), by focusing on a highly customizable ad management platform. A developer can add several SDKs and fine tune those options. For example, you can set it up so that a customer will only see Admob&#8217;s ads three times within a 24-hour period, after that limit is reached, new content from other sources like a different ad network, in-app purchase button,  or Twitter/RSS feed could fill that space.  The combination of new customizable services and the marketplace feature could be incredibly beneficial for small developers, who are not delivering tens of millions of impressions a day but are eager to maximize their ad mix. According to Rifkin, Burstly is not aiming to replace the mega ad networks, but let&#8217;s be honest, as Burstly&#8217;s marketplace grows (if, of course it can gain real traction)  more and more developers will devote a higher percentage of their inventory to Burstly&#8217;s marketplace.","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/appads-gets-a-makeover-and-1-8-million/","2010-03-30","2","11","548","395","4.255083","5.827848","32.00000","0.00000"

In fact, the tickets for the event, despite their $469 price, have been selling out quickly (they&#8217;ve been releasing them in waves). And today brings great news for those still clamoring to go: there is a new type of ticket, and they&#8217;re significantly cheaper.Today, Twitter is putting on sale tickets for the second day of the conference for only $140 (yes, 140, like Twitter&#8217;s character limit). To be clear, this is just for the second day of the conference, but for those on a budget, it&#8217;s a much better deal to be able to take part in the event. The second day is the hack-a-thon event taking place at Fort Mason in the city. And it actually begins at 7 PM PT at the end of day one of the event, when Twitter buses people over from the Palace of Fine Arts, where the day one events (including the major keynotes from Twitter execs) take place.(If you want to catch those day one keynotes, you better hurry, Twitter only has about 200 of those tickets left.)Those who buy these $140 day two tickets will have access to the Ignite event, the breakout sessions, the hack event, and the party which will take place at the end of day two.And, not to be upstaged by Facebook, which is offering student tickets to its f8 event (which is exactly one week later in San Francisco) at $75, Twitter is unleashing tickets for students to both days of the event for just $50. To get these heavily discounted tickets, student will need to bring a valid student ID.Much was made early on about the price of Twitter&#8217;s conference as compared to the rival f8 event, but actually, f8 is $425 this year (up from even the $325 we initially thought it would be). So Twitter&#8217;s conference is just $44 more, and that&#8217;s despite no outside partners (which the Facebook event has).Chirp is being produced by Carsonified, the group behind the popular FOWA events. It runs April 14 and 15 in San Francisco.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/twitter-chirp-tickets-2/","2010-03-30","1","8","371","252","3.624658","5.250000","12.00000","0.00000"
"79","Twitter Launches A New, Dynamic Homepage","Jason Kincaid","1","31","Twitter has just rolled out a new homepage that&#8217;s a marked improvement over the current offering, and does a much better job at capturing what the service is all about.  The new site features a &#8216;See who&#8217;s here&#8217; section that introduces new Twitter users to some of the celebrities and brands they can find on the service.    It also includes a new, constantly updated section for Top Tweets, which are algorithmically selected interesting tweets (Top Tweets also has its own Twitter account here).Twitter&#8217;s homepage is important because it&#8217;s typically the first thing people see when they visit Twitter for the first time (once you&#8217;ve created an account and signed in, the service automatically directs you to your Twitter feed).  Twitter last refreshed its homepage last summer, when it started featuring its search engine front and center (you can see a screenshot of the old page below).  This introduced users to the site&#8217;s powerful real-time search, but it didn&#8217;t do a particularly good job explaining exactly what Twitter was.I suspect the new page will do a better job enticing new users to explore Twitter, as they&#8217;ll be more quickly exposed to interesting tweets (via the Top Tweets section) and will immediately see a smattering of the major brands and celebrities using the service. And they&#8217;ll have something to look at other than tweets talking about Justin Bieber.Note that the page only appears to be showing up sometimes (I just reloaded and no longer see it).Update: Twitter has just posted a blog post talking about the change.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:All of our recent changes embrace the notion that Twitter is not just for status updates anymore. It&#8217;s a network where information is exchanged and consumed at a rapid clip every second of the day. With so much being shared, we know that there&#8217;s something of value for everyone. People who internalize the value of Twitter understand the power of this simple medium. But it hasn&#8217;t been easy to make that value transparent or obvious for curious folks coming to Twitter for the first time.Old HomepageCrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/twitter-launches-a-new-dynamic-homepage/","2010-03-30","5","30","357","252","4.190883","5.837302","206.66667","0.00000"
"80","Update: China&#8217;s Firewall Mistakes Google For Radio Free Asia (Or Not)","Erick Schonfeld","3","10","There may be a simpler explanation behind the increased blockage of Google search results in mainland China today than a deliberate government crackdown.  It seems that the Great Firewall of China which automatically filters out a long list of objectionable material on the Web from ever entering China is mistaking Google for Radio Free Asia, one of the sites blocked by China.According to a Google spokesperson who just got back to me, this seems to be what is happening:Lots of users in China have been unable to search on Google.com.hk today. This blockage seems to have been triggered by a change on Google&#8217;s part. In the last 24 hours &#8220;gs_rfai&#8221; started appearing in the URLs of Google searches globally as part of a search parameter, a string of characters that sends information about the query to Google so we can return the best result. Because this parameter contained the letters rfa the great firewall was associating these searches with Radio Free Asia, a service that has been inaccessible in China for a long time&#8211;hence the blockage. We are currently looking at how to resolve this issue.If this theory is correct, any URL that includes the letters &#8220;rfa&#8221; in a row could also be blocked.  It is not clear why the Great Firewall cannot figure out the difference between the rfa.org URL and a string of letters that happens to include the same letters (without the .org).  Another theory: China knows exactly what it is doing and it is just messing with Google.Update 2:  On second thought, even Google is not so sure that its Radio Free Asia theory holds any water.  Another Google spokesperson just sent me the following update:Having looked into this issue in more detail, it&#8217;s clear we actually added this parameter a week ago. So whatever happened today to block Google.com.hk must have been as a result of the change in the great firewall. However, interestingly our search traffic in China is now back to normal—even though we have not made any changes at our end. We will continue to monitor what is going on, but for the time being this issue seems to be resolved.Yup, China is just messing with them.Image credit: Flickr/The Humanaught.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/china-firewall-google-radio-free-asia/","2010-03-30","1","9","388","253","3.888594","5.794466","13.33333","0.00000"

Buddy Media previously raised $8 million in funding. Buddy Media offers brand marketers and agencies and all-in-one social media management system to help create, manage and track social campaigns on Facebook and Twitter (the client will also offers functionality for MySpace and other social networks). With regard to Facebook, the platform lets agencies create, manage and track Facebook Fan pages to drive and increase user and brand engagement. Users don’t need to have any prior FBML knowledge to create pages on Facebook and can create sleek and interactive pages fairly easily. Buddy Media’s Twitter Management System, which we wrote about here, lets marketers measure and identify Twitter trending topics around a particular brand, related topics and competitors. You can also track performance and trends for a brand and entire industry across Twitter with easy to view data on followers, mentions, and re-Tweets.As brands are flocking to Facebook to connect with the social network&#8217;s 400 million plus users, Buddy Media&#8217;s offerings come in handy. In fact, the startup is was profitable at the end of 2009, and is on track to make $20 million in sales this year. And well-known brands and organizations are using Buddy Media&#8217;s platform including Budweiser, NBC&#8217;s iVillage, designer Tory Burch, the NHL and the Dallas Cowboys. The platform finished 2009 with 150 clients, and has already added 45 more in 2010 alone. Buddy Media&#8217;s CEO and founder Michael Lazerow tells me that the startup is adding around 20 clients per month. And Lazerow says that the company needs more staff and talent to manage this rapid influx of clients. The new funding will be primarily used to hire developers and sales professionals. Buddy Media&#8217;s platform is attractive because it lets marketers and advertisers with little to no technical knowledge create and manage attractive, branded Facebook fan pages, Twitter profiles and more. Of course, Buddy Media has a few competitors in the field including Involver and CoTweet (which was just acquired by ExactTarget ).

"82","Unvarnished: A Clean, Well-Lighted Place For Defamation","Evelyn Rusli","12","334","Imagine every positive and ugly opinion about you&#8212; from your mother to that awkward co-worker you rejected at the company Christmas party&#8212; centrally located on one online profile. Sound scary? It is.Today, Unvarnished makes its beta debut. It&#8217;s essentially Yelp for LinkedIn: any user can create an online profile for a professional and submit anonymous reviews. You can claim your profile,  but unlike LinkedIn, you have to accept every post, warts and all. And once the profile is up there&#8217;s no taking it down.I asked co-founder, Peter Kazanjy, &#8220;Will you ever give users the option to take down their profile?&#8221; Kazanjy&#8217;s reply: &#8220;No, because if we did that, everyone would take their profile down&#8221; (see our video with Kazanjy after the break). Thus Unvarnished is a service that depends (and ultimately profits) on digital paranoia and our growing anxiety when it comes to our online identity. Doesn&#8217;t give you the warm fuzzies but (as Mike Arrington points out in &#8220;Reputation is Dead&#8221;) it is perhaps a logical evolution of social media. The site&#8217;s fundamental concept is not new (ikarma.com, Jerk.com) but Unvarnished has the best interface to attract a large community of professionals. Here&#8217;s the good, the bad and the truly ugly:For now, the site is invite-only beta. You can either join the nebulous waiting list or you can wait for a private alpha user (a group of roughly 1,000) to request a review from you via Facebook. Once you connect and submit a post your account is active and you are free to claim your profile, create a new profile, invite users and submit as many anonymous reviews as your little heart desires. There are roughly 400,000 profiles in the database with the vast majority from Silicon Valley.Unvarnished argues that there are lots of tools to actively manage your reputation (like updates, ability to comment and request new reviews)  but it omits the most important tool of all: the ability to strike down really damaging posts. Of course, empowering the user in that way would render the site toothless (a LinkedIn 2.0) because no sane person would keep a negative or even lukewarm review on their profile. But as I&#8217;ve said, the alternative is really scary.Let&#8217;s look at the few, real safeguards on Unvarnished: if a user has a dummy Facebook account (recently opened, no friends) and writes a negative review that post is automatically blocked. In addition, the community votes on how helpful a review is and positive ratings improve the trustworthy rank of the reviewer&#8212; a modest incentive to be fair. The truly vile and illegal trash&#8211; like false allegations of homicide&#8211; will be flagged and immediately removed.But let&#8217;s remember: there&#8217;s a wide spectrum between downright illegal and ambiguously negative. You could raise serious doubts about a person&#8217;s ethics and competency without proof and &#8212; let&#8217;s be honest here&#8212; without even believing your fabrications. This could be the place to anonymously settle vendettas: co-worker swipes a promotion, go to Unvarnished, boss dishes out a small bonus, go to Unvarnished, the vice president makes an ambiguous pass at your girlfriend, go to Unvarnished&#8230;you get the idea. Kazanjy says the goal of Unvarnished is to bring accountability and transparency to the workplace, which it will certainly do to some extent. But it will also become a nicely indexed, digital burn book. And we all know how that ends:Theoretically, a community of professionals has more scruples and ethics than a group of 17-year-olds (maybe), but my guess is that many will be seduced by the dark powers of the internet (the power to hammer an adversary under the guise of anonymity). Kazanjy says all those negative opinions/rumors are already out there, lurking in blog posts and comments. His site, Kazanjy says, merely condenses, organizes, and helps you refute those claims. I disagree, I think it encourages defamation by ensuring a forum. If you guarantee a microphone, there&#8217;s an extra incentive for a malicious co-worker to go out of their way to post a rumor&#8212; because they know it will directly affect your reputation. Obviously, the repercussions could be huge. A damaging review could severely jeopardize a user&#8217;s present and future employment. Because humans magnify the negative; an employee with 50 extremely positive reviews and 5 very negative reviews would be at a disadvantage against someone with no Unvarnished profile. Let&#8217;s look at one account with negative reviews:","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/unvarnished-a-clean-well-lighted-place-for-defamation/","2010-03-30","18","314","741","536","4.358799","5.960821","7560.00000","0.00000"

UK firm Coda Research Consultancy forecasts that in the U.S. alone mobile handset data traffic will grow from 8 petabytes/month this year to 327 petabytes/month in 2015.  That amounts to a 117 percent compound annual growth rate.A lot of that data will come in the form of mobile Web browsing, with the biggest contributor expected to be mobile video.  By 2015, mobile video will account for 68.5 percent of all mobile data  usage in the U.S. (or 224 petabytes/month).  Coda estimates that 95 million mobile handset subscribers in the U.S. will be watching video on their phones in five years out of a total of 158 million mobile internet users.Mobile data revenues (not including SMS charges) are forecast to make up 87 percent of all data revenue for the carriers by 2015.  But they will have a hard time keeping up with demand unless they adopt tiered pricing, predicts Coda co-founder Steve Smith.  Consumers used to all-you-can-eat data access from their phones will find that unappealing.  But carriers will have to figure out a way to pay for massive network upgrades.  Coda estimates that if the carrier&#8217;s froze their networks today, they would reach 100 percent utilization at peak capacity by 2012, when 40 percent of phones will be smartphones.The table below shows some more forecasts from Coda on the number of U.S. mobile Internet users and the percentage of mobile data traffic coming from smartphones versus feature phones:&nbsp;201020112012201320142015Mobile Internet users via handsets84M100M113M128M145M158MSmartphone traffic as % of handset traffic79%90%95%97%98%98%Feature phone traffic as % of handset traffic21%10%5%3%2%2%CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/mobile-data-traffic-rise-40-fold/","2010-03-30","4","21","331","233","4.031447","5.502146","117.33333","0.00000"

Concretely, Adobe has announced that its Flash Player will be included with future versions of Google Chrome right out the gate, so users will soon no longer be required to download and install a third-party plugin to make it work with the open source browser built on top of Chromium. Furthermore, updates to Flash Player will be delivered directly via Google Chrome&#8217;s updating system, ultimately minimizing security risks that tend to surface when using outdated software and components. You can download the dev channel build now, and yes, you can easily disable the built-in Flash Player if you like.In addition, Adobe says it is working with Mozilla and Google and the &#8220;broader community&#8221; to create a new API for browser plugins. This new API, which will build off Mozilla&#8217;s NPAPI, which has been designed from the start to be both operating system and browser neutral. In essence, the goal of the new API is to allow plugins to more tightly integrate with host browsers, which in turn should benefit users in terms of performance and security.The new browser plugin API will allow add-ons to directly share more information about its current state to its developers and the makers of the host browser it was made for, and it could also allow for a more secure browsing experience as the process of unifying security models and collaboration on techniques to defend against hackers (e.g. sandboxing) will be made easier. Indeed, Chrome&#8217;s “sandbox” has already been extended to Web pages with Flash content.From the Chromium blog:Improving the traditional browser plug-in model will make it possible for plug-ins to be just as fast, stable, and secure as the browser’s HTML and JavaScript engines. Over time this will enable HTML, Flash, and other plug-ins to be used together more seamlessly in rendering and scripting.You can read the respective announcements regarding the partnership directly from Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player team and on the Chromium blog.I inquired about plans to integrate Flash Player with Google Chrome OS too, but was unsurprisingly told that there are no announcements to be made right now. Adobe did say Google is a close partner in the Open Screen Project, which I translate to &#8220;yeah, probably&#8221;.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/flash-player-to-come-bundled-with-google-chrome-new-browser-plugin-api-coming/","2010-03-30","9","51","415","285","4.179551","5.880702","624.00000","0.00000"
"85","Digital Due Process Coalition Looks To Update Online Privacy Laws","Jason Kincaid","1","10","This morning, over two dozen major tech companies, civil rights organizations, lawyers, and privacy advocates banded together to launch Digital Due Process, a coalition that is focused on helping modernize digital privacy laws.  Specifically, the coalition is looking to revamp the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which defines the laws that govern online privacy and how law enforcement can retrieve information from online service providers. ECPA was approved in 1986, when the Internet was in its infancy, and the coalition contends that it has become confusing and doesn&#8217;t include enough safeguards to protect user data.  Among the coalition&#8217;s members are AOL, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Salesforce, Loopt, AT&amp;T, the ACLU, and the EFF.Here are the four core principles on the DDP website:A governmental entity may require an entity covered by ECPA (a provider of wire or electronic communication service or a provider of remote computing service) to disclose communications that are not readily accessible to the public only with a search warrant issued based on a showing of probable cause, regardless of the age of the communications, the means or status of their storage or the provider’s access to or use of the communications in its normal business operations.A governmental entity may access, or may require a covered entity to provide, prospectively or retrospectively, location information regarding a mobile communications device only with a warrant issued based on a showing of probable cause.A governmental entity may access, or may require a covered entity to provide, prospectively or in real time, dialed number information, email to and from information or other data currently covered by the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices only after judicial review and a court finding that the governmental entity has made a showing at least as strong as the showing under 2703(d).Where the Stored Communications Act authorizes a subpoena to acquire information, a governmental entity may use such subpoenas only for information related to a specified account(s) or individual(s). All non-particularized requests must be subject to judicial approval.Google has written a blog post outlining the same principles (the wording is a bit easier to understand). Google has also produced the video below to explain the issue.Better protect your data stored online: The government must first get a search warrant before obtaining any private communications or documents stored online;Better protect your location privacy: The government must first get a search warrant before it can track the location of your cell phone or other mobile communications device;Better protect against monitoring of when and with whom you communicate: The government must demonstrate to a court that the data it seeks is relevant and material to a criminal investigation before monitoring when and with whom you communicate using email, instant messaging, text messaging, the telephone, etc.; andBetter protect against bulk data requests: The government must demonstrate to a court that the information it seeks is needed for a criminal investigation before it can obtain data about an entire class of users.","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/digital-due-process-coalition-looks-to-update-online-privacy-laws/","2010-03-30","1","10","512","349","4.597610","6.613181","14.66667","0.00000"

China&#8217;s firewall is mistaking it for Radio Free Asia.When Google shut down its Chinese search operations and moved them to Hong Kong, it placed its search results outside the so-called Great Chinese Firewall.  China immediately started blocking politically sensitive search queries, just as it does for all Web content outside the firewall.  That was a week ago.  But reports are coming out of China today that censors are turning up the heat on Google, and &#8220;searches on any topic delivered an error message,&#8221; according to the Telegraph One blogger in China says all searches on Google return the &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; and result in a connection reset.  Although some Tweets from inside China say they have no problems with Google being blocked.  Google&#8217;s Mainland China availability page has yet to be updated today and showed no issues with Web search as of yesterday.  However, Google&#8217;s mobile sites started to be partially blocked three days ago.  Gmail is still working.Whether China is moving to completely block Google or it is just tweaking its settings on the Great Firewall, the Chinese government is likely to continue its efforts to clamp down on access to Google.  Chinese media are not allowed to veer from the Party line when discussing the issue.  But blocking Google entirely also serves as a stark reminder to China&#8217;s people that the Great Firewall exists and there is a whole other world of information on the Web their censors don&#8217;t want them to see.Image credit: Flickr/The Humanaught.CrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/chinese-censors-turn-up-the-heat-on-google/","2010-03-30","1","49","271","190","4.281369","5.926316","66.66667","0.00000"

The company is one of the most widely used ad platforms and counts NPR, CNN and Fox as clients. Today, the advertising platform is announcing a Universal SDK for iPhone and iPad, allowing publishers and developers to seamlessly switch between ad networks and first-party ad servers.  The Medialets Universal SDK for iPhone and iPad  will allows publishers to modify and change their ad tags from various networks without having to update their app. The new SDK works with any first or third party ad sever, network or mediator, including AdMob  and Quattro Wireless tags. Medialets promises rich media and display advertising on mobile phones that provides deeper engagement with users. In fact, engagement is a primary measurement that the ad platform focuses on when determining the success of its advertising campaigns. Medialets says its app engagement see between 3.5 and 7 minutes of average usage per app usage session. But developers and advertisers may be more beholden to click-through rates, which Medialets claim are between 1 and 8 percent. But eight percent seems a bit high, considering that other rich media mobile ad platforms, including Greystripe and AdMob, are seeing between 1 and 2 percent. The universal SDK is definitely an attractive feature for developers who may not want to waste time in switching in SDKs for different networks (Mobclix allows you to do this within its platform). And I imagine that other mobile ad networks will develop their own universal SDKs in due time. Medialets has raised $4 million in Series A funding last spring and plans to launch a universal SDK for Android in the next month.

The ecommerce juggernaut also casually mentioned that it is on pace to reach a whopping $1.5 billion worth of goods sold via mobile phones in 2010 – more than double the mobile GMV (gross merchandise value) it registered in 2009 ($600 million).The company claims its primary iPhone app, which is available in more than 190 countries and eight languages, has been downloaded 8 million times to date, and that 1 item is purchased using eBay mobile every 2 seconds. Also, eBay disclosed that it will have an iPad version of the eBay app ready at launch day (April 3).One of the two iPhone apps being launched today is for the eBay.com global marketplace (iTunes link), while the other is for eBay’s new classifieds site, eBayClassifieds.com (iTunes link). With the apps, sellers can quickly take a picture of an item, list it in eBay&#8217;s auction format free of charge and share listings on Facebook or Twitter. Registered buyers, in turn, can easily purchase items via the mobile apps, particularly when using the PayPal Mobile app for iPhone, which allows users to quickly email money or “bump” iPhones with a seller to transfer funds between PayPal accounts.

Barring that, it&#8217;s a nice proof of concept.The app, called Meteo360, has three modes. When you hold the iPhone flat it shows a weather map. When you hold it up to the sky you see the city you&#8217;re in and the current weather, and when you hold it upright it turns on the camera and overlays weather information over the current scene. The app will be free and should be available on the Apple store next week.

"92","Mobile Advertising Network Greystripe Brings Its iFlash Ads To The iPad","Leena Rao","7","6","Although the iPad apparently lacks Flash, that doesn&#8217;t mean that rich media won&#8217;t be able to function on the device. Yesterday, we heard that Brightcove will stream video in an HTML5 video player as opposed to a Flash unit. And today, Greystripe is announcing that it will be bringing its rich media iFlash ad units to the iPad in May. Greystripe has been allowing advertisers to use Flash-like technologies in their iPhone advertisements for some time now. The network essentially takes ads created using Flash and transcodes them to run on the iPhone and now the iPad. The technology changes the nature of the Flash ads on the front end but the rich media ad behaves the same way.  Greystripe claims that its &#8220;iFlash&#8221; ads see higher clickthrough rates than even online campaigns, with average CTRs above 1%. And Greystripe says that its mobile iFlash ads increase awareness of a brand and intent to purchase, watch or recommend a particular brand. Brands using Greystripe&#8217;s mobile ads include HP, Burger King, Axe, Dunlop and LeapFrog.But the real question is if advertisers see better CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) with Greystripe&#8217;s ads than its competitors, such as AdMob or Quattro Wireless. To our knowledge, Greystripe&#8217;s CPMs fall into the same range as AdMob&#8217;s. But Greystripe has continued to make its rich media ad offerings more appealing and attractive to both developers and advertisers by extending support to various devices and even launching a guaranteed CPM program. The company also partnered with Tribal Fusion to enable online ads to fit on iPhones seamlessly. It&#8217;s unclear how Google&#8217;s acquisition of AdMob and Apple&#8217;s acquisition of Quattro Wireless will effect the other ad networks in the space. If anything, these networks will now have to compete with two of the largest companies in the world. But Greystripe, which received a $2 million infusion from NBC last year, could see its stock go up if its pseudo-Flash ads seem to perform well on the iPadCrunchBase Information","http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/mobile-advertising-network-greystripe-brings-its-iflash-ads-to-the-ipad/","2010-03-30","0","6","343","249","4.358434","5.811245","0.00000","0.00000"

Here&#8217;s how it works: real estate agents place signs or ads about a property for sale that prompt interested buyers to send a text message carrying a unique ID code and receive more information, pricing and optionally some photos of the property in response. The agent and potential buyer can then connect in a variety of ways to discuss the properties for sale.I suppose it&#8217;s a solution that can benefit real estate pros tremendously, but I&#8217;m seriously doubting if people are generally inclined to simply send a text message to an agent. The way I see it, there are enough ways for potential buyers to get in touch with sellers if they&#8217;re genuinely interested as it is. I also think QR codes or other types of barcodes that can transfer multimedia to mobile phones directly would be far more effective when placed on signs or ads.Your thoughts?

"98","Europe&#8217;s biggest publisher embraces the WePad","Markus Goebel","15","36","[Germany] Billed as an iPad competitor, the WePad is not vaporware, but is in fact, The Chosen One. At least, that&#8217;s the view of some, who are hailing the WePad as the saviour of the German print publishing industry. While Apple is still racing to the wire to secure enough media content partnerships for the iPad before its launch this week, the WePad has already bagged Europe&#8217;s biggest publisher, Gruner + Jahr.Bernd Buchholz, CEO of Gruner + Jahr, presented the first German-born slate PC at last week&#8217;s annual press conference for his company. Unfortunately, there is only a very dark photo of this event on Facebook (see above), but you can find new professional shots on sites like Areamobile (below).Axel Springer, publisher of Europe&#8217;s biggest newspaper BILD is also in talks to use the WePad, says the latest rumour quoted by German newswire DPA.But Buchholz must have jumped the gun, because the WePad&#8217;s creator Neofonie had scheduled all official announcements about the WePad&#8217;s hardware and media partnerships for April 12. That didn&#8217;t hold Buchholz back from presenting a WePad version of Stern, one of Germany&#8217;s biggest magazines which sells 900,000 copies. Other similar versions of Gruner + Jahr magazines like Geo or Gala are in the making. They will be marketed at similar prices like their print versions and the launch date is just some months away. Apart from the text and pictures of their print issues, the WePad versions will be full of audio, video and Flash and also interwoven with the magazines&#8217; websites.It seems that Gruner + Jahr is not the only publisher who believes in the WePad&#8217;s success. Neofonie CEO Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen is &#8220;happy about the first big advance orders from companies&#8221;, he wrote on the WePad Facebook site (5,709 fans). Gruner + Jahr has officially announced a plan to license the WePad&#8217;s epaper software, that Neofonie developed on their behalf, to other publishers. The WeMagazine publishing software is platform independent and apparently works with several devices or user interfaces, including the iPad and normal computers.The underlying strategy is clear: &#8220;We insist on our sovereignity of products and contents&#8221;, Buchholz said in his Thursday&#8217;s speech, clearly hinting at recent problems. Apple removed the Stern iPhone app in November without warning from the App Store due to objections over photo galleries featuring too much nakedness. The Association of German Magazine Publishers (VDZ) warned that such intrusions might represent a move towards censorship.German publishers are also disgruntled with Apple&#8217;s pricing policy. Buchholz said they need to &#8220;get in charge of pricing&#8221;. Apple&#8217;s regulations have the absurd side effect that an iPhone version of Germany&#8217;s most important news magazine, Der Spiegel, will cost more than the print version. Its price will soon jump to &#8364;3.99, after the &#8364;2.99 introductory offer is over, while the paper sells for &#8364;3.80. Therefore Gruner + Jahr appears to be at the helm of establishing a totally competing platform to the iPad. &#8220;We are in talks with nearly all big and small German publishers, also with [our big competitors] Springer and Burda&#8221;, Buchholz said in a press conference after his speech.Oddly, Gruner + Jahr has jumped the gun before the official April 12 event, and the WePad&#8217;s hardware spec is now getting out there. Gadget geeks have posted interesting links, such a possible WePad prototype running Windows. It also appears that the WePad will be made by OEM Pegatron, a company connected to the iPhone, ironically.So far Neofonie isn&#8217;t very helpful on what ebooks formats will be  supported. Its latest product sheet says again that the iPad uses a &#8220;proprietary Apple format for iBooks store&#8221; while, they claim, the WePad is better for supporting &#8220;all open formats, additionally premium formats&#8221;. This repeats their statement which was criticised after our latest TechCrunch post.CrunchBase Information","http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/03/29/europes-biggest-publisher-embraces-the-wepad/","2010-03-29","5","25","645","464","4.412975","6.010776","130.00000","0.00000"

"100","Boxcar Opens Up Its iPhone Push Notifications. And Soon, You Can Monetize Them","MG Siegler","5","18","Push Notifications on the iPhone are great, but they can be impossible to manage. That&#8217;s why Boxcar, a Push Notification management app, is brilliant, and has long been one of my favorite apps. Unfortunately, as great as it is, like Apple itself, it is also a closed system. But now, it&#8217;s opening up.What I mean by closed system is that Boxcar only serves up notifications for a select few services, such as Twitter and Facebook. But with its new Provider feature (and API), anyone can tap into the Boxcar platform to enable Push Notifications through the service.This step has been in the works for a few months creator Jonathan George tells us. But it comes just weeks after a competitor, Notifo, started offering the same thing. However, unlike Notifo, Boxcar subscriptions and settings are easily managed from within the iPhone app itself, rather than having to visit a site to manage things.And there&#8217;s another potentially huge benefit.Beginning in Q2 2010, Boxcar is going to open up these provider notifications to be monetized. What this means is that third-parties can charge customers for the ability to get Push Notifications and Boxcar will share the revenue from the in-app purchase as a 50/50 split. It&#8217;s worth noting that this would work only for one-time purchases, and not for subscriptions. Still, this is potentially a nice way for third-parties to make some money without having to worry about building an maintaining their own Push Notification system.Unlike Notifo, Boxcar plans to review all services that want to use the providers feature to maintain some order. And, as Boxcar notes:There are two kinds of notifications &#8211; broadcast notifications, and individual notifications. Individual notifications are best used for action items, such as when a users comment is replied to. Broadcast notifications send the same message to every Boxcar user that has subscribed to your provider.While the service currently only works for the iPhone, the plan is to launch an Android app within the next 90 days. After that, Windows Mobile support should come along.But even without those other platforms, Boxcar is doing just fine. So far, the service has pushed over 100,000,000 Push Notifications to date.You can find Boxcar in the App Store here. It&#8217;s a free download.

"101","Keynoir launches innovative members-only group buying model","Mike Butcher","10","39","A new take on the group-buying bandwagon launches today, but this one will attempt to address the information overload about offers, known as &#8220;voucher fatigue&#8221;, while incentivising local businesses. Keynoir is described as a &#8220;private buying club meets Woot&#8221;, in reference to the tech site which made its name by having just one offer on one decent product a day. The startup even includes aspects of the old Letsbuyit.com. But this is not a trivial play. Keynoir has already secured £1.3m of investment from PROFounders Capital, investor Jan Riem and Index Ventures (including Dominique Vidal). Serial entrepreneurs Paul Birch and Andrej Henkler participated. Vidal and Sean Seton-Rogers from PROfounders will be joining the board.The founders are Philip Wilkinson (founder of the UK&#8217;s first price comparison engine which later became Kelkoo), Glen Drury (ex-MD Kelkoo Europe and VP Yahoo), and Jan Riem (technology deal maker). It launches in London this week , and plans to exand across the rest of the UK and Europe by the end of the year.Here&#8217;s how it will work. Users will buy lifestyle experiences (such as hotels, restaurant bookings and spa days) and more &#8220;unusual and secret things&#8221; they say. There will be one such offer a day (called a Keypass) with a limited time window and limited quantity available, driving adoption. As with other group buying sites, a minimum number of people are required to confirm a purchase before the offer is unlocked to the rest of the member base. But the founders emphasise that since not everyone who arrives at the site will be accepted as a member, Keynoir will be very targetted.“People are becoming increasing weary and cynical of the whole discount marketplace and are looking for something more fulfilling,&#8221; says Wilkinson. It&#8217;s targeting 23 – 35 year old professionals and is looking to have a strict selection process for deals across the travel, food, retail and entertainment sectors.His view is that that local businesses will like Keynoir since the business only pays if it gets enough people to buy on that day, thus filling capacity in the downturn without heavy advertising costs.Hoberman is equally enthusiastic. He calls it the start of a &#8220;a new generation of social buying which will effectively connect the offline and online worlds.”My view is that the walled garden approach is smart. In fact it&#8217;s already been tried by Wahanda, not through creating a barrier to entry before you can get in, but by targeting a niche. This is the one thing that most group buying sites have missed, thus leading to offer fatigue.However the model is of course replicable, so watch as other sites spring up to copy its approach.Especially for TechCrunch readers, this link will automatically get you around the invite selection process and let you create an account to see the first launch deal.CrunchBase Information","http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/keynoir-launches-innovative-members-only-group-buying-model/","2010-03-30","1","38","486","339","4.161426","5.855457","52.00000","0.00000"
